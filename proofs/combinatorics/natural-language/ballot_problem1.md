This proof is the Ballot Theorem, which is used to calculate the number of ways of casting votes such that one candidate is always in the lead. This theorem is involved in the process using mathematical induction.

In its simplest terms, this theorem says that for any positive integer 'k', and integers 'a' and 'b', if 'k' is greater than or equal to 1 and 'a' is greater than or equal to 'kb', the number of ways of casting votes, denoted as Nk(a, b), equals the combination of 'a+b' taken 'a' at a time, multiplied by the quantity 'a-kb' divided by 'a+b'.

Initially, we verify the base cases: when 'b' equals to zero, Nk(a, 0) is always 1, and when 'a' equals to 'kb', Nk(kb, b) is always 0.

Then we begin induction by showing that for any 'a' and 'b', the number of ways to sequence votes, Nk(a, b), can be calculated as the sum of Nk(a, b - 1) and Nk(a - 1, b). This is the recurrence relation to be used in the process of induction.

To further support this induction logic, we analyze the last vote by showing a combinatorial argument. For all 'a' and 'b', the number of possible sequences of votes, Nk(a, b), can be calculated by a certain formula involving combinations, integer 'k', 'a', 'b', and the total votes 'a + b'.

As part of simplification and as an inductive step, we prove that Nk(a, b) is equal to '(a - kb) / (a + b) * C(a + b, a)', where C denotes the binomial coefficient.

In conclusion, for all 'k', 'a', 'b' where 'k' is equal to or greater than 1 and 'a' is equal to or greater than 'kb', the number of vote counting ways Nk(a, b) equals to 'C(a + b, a) * (a - kb) / (a + b)'. Hence, the theorem is proved.

The theorem, named after Andr√© and referred to as the Ballot Problem, states that for any natural numbers a and b, and any number k greater than or equal to 1, the number of good paths (a, b, k) equals the combination of (a + b, a) minus the product of (k + 1) and the combination of [(a + b) - 1, a].

In this case, a path that ends below the x-axis is considered a 'bad path', and any path that does not end below the x-axis is considered a 'good path'. 

Now, imagine a function that takes a bad path and rotates one segment 180 degrees and reflects another segment. This function effectively transforms the bad path into a good path, laying the groundwork for a reversible procedure.

The proof then partitions all bad paths into different sets, denoted as Bi, where i ranges from 0 to k. This partitioning ensures that each separate set of bad paths (Bi) doesn't overlap with any other set (Bj), where i does not equal j. 

A property of symmetry is established, stating that the number of bad paths in each set (|Bi|) is the same for any two distinct sets i and j. 

Next, the proof calculates the number of good paths, which is found by subtracting the total number of bad paths (partitioned into k sets) from the total number of paths for fixed a and b.

Simplifying this result leads to a formula for the number of good paths that is equal to the combination of (a + b, a) minus the product of (k + 1) and the combination of [(a + b) - 1, a].

Finally, the proof concludes by reiterating the theorem's original claim that for any natural numbers a and b, any number k greater than or equal to 1, the number of good paths (a, b, k) equals the combination of (a + b, a) minus the product of (k + 1) and the combination of [(a + b) - 1, a]. 

Hence, the theorem is proved.

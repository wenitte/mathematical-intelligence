This theorem is called the DRM Formula. It is a bi-conditional statement, meaning that the statement is true if both the conditions before and after the "if and only if" connective are true.

The first condition is the DRM Formula itself. The second condition is a universally quantified statement, meaning it asserts that something is true for all cases - in this case, for all natural numbers n where n > 0.

Let's break down this second condition. It says, for every natural number 'n' greater than zero, if you round the factorial of 'n' multiplied by the inverse of the base of the natural logarithm (or 'e' raised to the power of minus one), you will get the absolute value of the number produced by the DRM construct of 'n'.

The DRM construct is presumably a function that takes an input, 'n' in this case, and returns a numeric output. The factorial function, denoted with 'n!', multiplies 'n' by every natural number less than 'n' down to 1. 'E' is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828, and 'e' to the power of -1 is one divided by 'e'. 

So, summarizing the entire theorem in plain language: the DRM formula is proven to be true if and only if the rounding of the product of n factorial and the reciprocal of e equals the absolute value of the number produced by applying the DRM construct to any natural number 'n' that is greater than zero.

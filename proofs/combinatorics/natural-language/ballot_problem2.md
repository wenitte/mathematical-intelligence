In simple terms, this theorem you're looking at is known as the Ballot Theorem. It's proven using a method of mathematical proof called induction, which basically means to show that if a statement holds for some natural number, then it must also hold for the next natural number. Now let me break this down to you:

The theorem is generally talking about any integers 'k', 'a' and 'b' such that 'k' is greater or equal to 1 and 'a' is greater or equal to 'k' times 'b'. If those conditions are fulfilled, then some function 'N' which takes 'k', 'a', 'b' as parameters equals a certain combination 'C' with 'a + b' and 'a' as parameters, then times the difference between 'a' and 'kb', and divide it by the sum of 'a' and 'b'.

The base case of induction for this theorem shows that for any 'a' and 'b', the function 'N' of 'a' and 0 equals 1 and the function 'N' of 'k' times 'b' and 'b' equals 0.

Moving to the induction step, this proof states that for any 'a' and 'b', the function 'N' of 'a' and 'b' can also be calculated as the sum of the function 'N' of 'a' and 'b - 1' plus the function 'N' of 'a - 1' and 'b'.

Next, it introduces a combinatorial argument where for any 'a' and 'b', the function 'N' of 'a' and 'b' can also be calculated by a more complex formula. 

Then, it simplifies our original function 'N' to be equal to difference between 'a' and 'kb' divided by the sum of 'a' and 'b' and then times the combination 'C' with parameters 'a + b' and 'a'.

Finally, this proof concludes successfully with the restating of  the original theorem. In the end, it confirms that for any integers 'k', 'a' and 'b' such that 'k' is greater or equal to 1 and 'a' is greater or equal to 'k' times 'b', the function 'N' of 'k', 'a', 'b' indeed equals the stated value, and so the theorem is proven to be true.

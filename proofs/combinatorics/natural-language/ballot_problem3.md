The theorem known as the Ballot Theorem Uniform Partition asserts that, for any integers k, a and b where k is at least 1 and a is at least the product of k and b (kb), the quantity Nk(a, b) is equal to the binomial coefficient of a and a + b, multiplied by the difference of a and kb, and this result is divided by the sum of a and b.

This proof hinges on a concept referred to as Lattice Paths Partitioning. This asserts that for any positive integers n, a, and b, if n equals the sum of a and b, then we can define a set Ψ composed of all Lattice Paths of the total length n, such that this set can be partitioned into a + b subsets.

A key part of the argument depends on the premise that for every path P in the subset A and for every point in a predefined set Ω₀ that includes the origin (0, 0), P is considered a 'good' path. 

The proof then posits uniform partitioning, asserting that for every index value i, for any chosen path P, if the pair (P, i) is a part of the set Ω₀, then this is equivalent to every possible path pairing with i (denoted as Y, i) being part of the set Ω₀ only if and only if path Y is 'good'. 

The proof pivots on the consideration of the cardinality, or size, of the good paths. It asserts that the size of set Ω₀ is equal to the difference of a and kb times the size of subset A, all divided by the sum of a and b.

After having established all these relations, the proof concludes by asserting that Nk(a, b) equals the binomial coefficient of a and a + b, multiplied by the difference of a and kb and all divided by the sum of a and b. In essence, this conclusion reiterates the initial affirmation made by the theorem, thereby providing a valid and complete proof for the Ballot Theorem Uniform Partition.

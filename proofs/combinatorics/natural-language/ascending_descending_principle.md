This proof asserts the following theorem: For any infinite sequence of real numbers, there exists a subset that is also infinite and either ascending or descending. 

Here's an explanation of the proof:

First, we assume we have an infinite sequence of real numbers. Let's call this sequence L.

Next, we define a new set ω that includes all natural numbers that index, or keep track of, elements in our sequence L.

Then, a function f is defined that pairs two elements from this set of natural numbers (ω). This function takes these pairs and returns either 0 or 1. The pair gets a 0 if the first number is less than the second and the element of L indexed by the first number is less than or equal to the element of L indexed by the second. Basically, this function checks if elements in L are ascending based on their index in the sequence.

Then, we apply a mathematical concept called Ramsey's Theorem, which gives us a homogeneous subset, let's call this A, which is an infinite subset of ω.

Now, let's assume all pairs in this subset A got a color 0 from function f. That means all pairs from A have the first number less than the second and the corresponding element of L indexed by the first number is less than or equal to the one indexed by the second. Hence, this forms an ascending sequence. We denote this sequence S, which is made up of elements from L whose indices are present in A. 

If A has a color 1 from function f, that means for all pairs from A, the first number is less than the second, but the element of L indexed by the first number is greater than the one indexed by the second. Hence, this defines a descending sequence, which we similarly denote as S.

In both scenarios, the sequence S is infinite since A (from which S is derived) is infinite. 

So finally, the proof states that an infinite sequence of real numbers always contains an ascending or descending infinite subsequence, as depicted by the sequence S. The proof shows that such an S exists, proving the initially mentioned theorem.

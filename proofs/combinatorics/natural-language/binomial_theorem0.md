The theorem is a formal statement of the Binomial Theorem â€“ a fundamental principle in combinatorics that lets us expand expressions of the form (a + b)^n for any natural numbers a, b, and n. 

This proof is carrying out by means of mathematical induction, a common method for proving statements about all natural numbers.

1. The proof begins with the Base Case (B), which asserts that the theorem holds true for the "smallest" natural number, namely 1. It's saying that (a + b)^1 equals a + b, which is evidently true.

2. Then, we propose the Inductive Hypothesis (H) - an assumption that the theorem holds for an arbitrary natural number n.

3. The core step is the Expansion Step (E), where we're expanding (a + b)^(n+1) by multiplying the right-hand side of our inductive hypothesis (the expanded form of (a + b)^n) by (a + b).

4. Next, we carry out a distribution of terms (T), multiplying each term in the expanded expression of the Binomial Theorem by both 'a' and 'b' separately.

5. Afterwards, we use Pascal's Identity (P). This identity tells us that for any 'm' less than or equal to 'n', the sum of "'n choose m' and 'n choose m+1'" is "'n+1 choose m+1'". We apply this identity to simplify the sums obtained during the term distribution step.

6. Finally, after applying Pascal's Identity, we arrive at the Final Form (F) of our theorem, which completes the inductive step of our proof. The Final Form matches our original statement of the Binomial Theorem but now for 'n+1' instead of 'n', confirming that if our theorem is valid for 'n', it's also valid for 'n+1'.

Together, these steps make up a proof by induction for the Binomial Theorem: the base case has been validated, and we've shown it holds for 'n+1' if it holds for 'n'. Therefore, the Binomial Theorem is true for all natural numbers.

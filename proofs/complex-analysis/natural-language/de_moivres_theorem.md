The proof revolves around a formula known as De Moivre's Theorem, which states that for any natural number n, the formula (cos x + i sin x)ⁿ is equivalent to cos(nx) + i sin(nx).

Firstly, we start with our base case which is when n equals one. When we substitute 1 into the formula, we get that (cos x + i sin x) to the power 1 equals cos(1x) + i sin(1x), which is true. This validates the base case of the mathematical induction. 

Moving on, we make an inductive hypothesis by assuming that the formula is true for an arbitrary natural value k. This means that (cos x + i sin x) to the power k equals cos(kx) + i sin(kx). 

The next goal is to prove that the formula holds for k plus one. In this inductive step, we need to prove that (cos x + i sin x) from power k+1 equals cos(k+1)x + i sin(k+1)x. To do this, we simply rewrite (cos x + i sin x) to the power k+1 as (cos x + i sin x) to the power k multiplied by another (cos x + i sin x). The next step is using our inductive hypothesis to substitute (cos x + i sin x) power k, with cos(kx) + i sin(kx) and then multiplying this value by (cos x + i sin x). 

When we simplify this operation, we eventually obtain the desired result, which is cos((k+1)x) + i sin((k+1)x). This completes the proof by induction.

The conclusion of the proof is that by applying mathematical induction, De Moivre's theorem is valid for all natural numbers n. In other words, for every natural number n, (cos x + i sin x)ⁿ does indeed equal cos(nx) + i sin(nx). And that’s the proof.

This proof is demonstrating that it is impossible to successfully dissect a unit cube into a series of valid, disjoint cubes of different sizes that all together cover the unit cube. 

This proof has several key steps and definitions:

1. Definitions:
   - A cube: Defined as a point in three-dimensional space, ℝ³, with a certain width greater than zero.
   - Valid cubes: A set (C) of cubes, where all cubes (c) in C have a width (width(c)) greater than zero.
   - to_set(c): The set of points (p) that belong to cube c, on all the three axes (x, y, z).
   - Disjoint cubes: A condition where any two different cubes, c₁ and c₂, in C do not overlap, i.e., their intersection is null.
   - Cover unit cube: The union of all cubes in C covers the unit cube entirely.
   - Different Sizes and finite(C): The cubes in C have different sizes and C is a finite set.

2. Hole concept: It introduces a concept of a "hole", a valid entity (valid(h)), where the lower boundary of the hole overlaps with one or more cubes in C and the upper boundary is enclosed within the lower boundaries of the cubes. It also selects the smallest cube that encloses the bottom of the hole (minimum_cube(h)).

3. Key Lemmas:
   - The bottom of the unit cube is identified as a hole (unit_cube_bottom_is_hole).
   - If a hole is demonstrated, it can be assumed that the smallest cube of the hole is also a hole (minimum_cube_is_hole).
   - The width of each subsequent minimum cube decreases (width_decreases).

4. Infinite Descent: A sequence of holes is constructed from the bottom of the unit cube. Each subsequent hole in the sequence is the smallest cube of the previous hole. The sequence is shown to have the following properties: each entity in the sequence is indeed a hole; the sequence is strictly decreasing in terms of width; each hole appears only once; every hole in the sequence is in C. 

5. Proof by Contradiction: It's shown that this leads to a contradiction because the sequence is infinite (since the width is always decreasing), but the set of cubes C, from which every hole in the sequence is drawn, is finite. Therefore, the initial assumption that such a dissection is possible is false. 

In simpler terms, the proof states that we cannot divide a cube into a finite number of smaller, non-overlapping cubes of different sizes, which altogether perfectly match the original cube. The proof is made by demonstrating that attempting such a dissection results in an infinite sequence of "holes" (spaces that need to be filled), each of which is smaller than the last, a contradiction to the criteria that we only have a finite set of cubes.

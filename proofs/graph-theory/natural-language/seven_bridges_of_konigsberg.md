The theorem we are discussing is known as the Euler Path theorem. It states that for any connected graph, an Eulerian path exists if and only if either no nodes have an odd degree, or exactly two nodes have an odd degree.

To understand these concepts, let's first define some terms. A graph consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. A binary relation between two nodes indicates the existence of an edge between them.

We can apply this high-level concept to real-world problems, such as the famous Konigsberg Bridge problem. In this situation, the landmasses are considered as nodes and the bridges are considered as edges. The specifics of the geography are irrelevant; only the connections between nodes (landmasses) matter.

Our path must obey certain constraints. It must enter and exit each node exactly once (enter(n) → must_exit(n)) and each edge must be used exactly once (use_count(e) = 1). The implications of these constraints become apparent when considering node degrees. Nodes with even degrees have a balanced entry and exit, whereas nodes with odd degrees have an unbalanced entry and exit.

With these constraints, an Eulerian path for a graph can fall into one of two cases. In the first case, two nodes (representing the start and end nodes) have odd degrees and all other nodes have even degrees. In the second case, all nodes have even degrees, implying that the path starts and ends at the same node.

Considering the Konigsberg Bridge problem, the degree of each landmass (node) is respectively 3, 3, 5, and 3. This leads to four nodes of odd degree. As per Euler's theorem, an Eulerian path does not exist in such a scenario. Hence, there’s no solution that allows one to cross each bridge once and only once.

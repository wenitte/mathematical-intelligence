This proof is essentially clarifying the properties and relationships of different elements within a polyhedron, then subsequently linking this to the Euler's formula and finally suggesting how these apply to the concept of a convex polyhedron and a polyhedron's topological properties.

Firstly, the proof defines what a polyhedron (P) is. It states that something is a polyhedron if and only if it has vertices, edges and faces which are non-empty and all incidences (the connections between these elements) are included in the set of vertices, edges, and faces itself.

For every edge within this polyhedron, there must exist two distinct vertices such that each vertex is linked to this edge. Similarly, for every face within the polyhedron, there must be at least three distinct edges connected to that face.

Next, the proof sets up the Euler's formula for the polyhedron; that is, in any polyhedron the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces is always equal to 2. This formula is proven to hold true for all polyhedra.

The concepts above are then applied to define a convex polyhedron. A polyhedron is considered convex if for any two distinct points on the vertices, the line segment connecting those two points is entirely within the polyhedron. It is inferred that all convex polyhedra fall under the general definition of polyhedra.

Finally, the proof refers to the topological property of the polyhedron. This property states that there exists a polyhedron that is equivalent (homeomorphic) to the original and is sphere-like in nature. It is inferred that all polyhedra that have this topological property also satisfy the Euler's formula.

This proof covers several related theorems, which revolve around demonstrating the irrationality or transcendence of certain mathematical constants: π (pi), π² (pi squared), and e. Transcendence implies a number is not algebraic, i.e., it's not a root of any non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. 

[Theorem 1: π is irrational]
The first theorem proves that π is irrational. This is done by using a recurrence relation and integral analysis. The recurrence described integrates a function with power n over a fixed interval from -1 to 1. If you assume π is rational for sake of contradiction, it would mean that a certain function applied to π would result in an integer which contradicts the fact that the integral of the function tends to 0 when n approaches infinity.

[Theorem 2: π² is irrational]
The second theorem follows a similar process to prove that the square of π is also irrational. In case you might think squaring an irrational number could possibly yield a rational one, this theorem dispels such an idea. Once again it uses the method of contradiction with an assumption that π squared is rational, and fails, because the integral of another function with π squared as argument again tends to 0 while the integer assumption implies it should not.

[Theorem 3: e is transcendental]
The third theorem goes one step further, aiming not just to prove that a number is irrational, i.e. not expressible as a ratio of two integers, but rather transcendental, meaning that it can't be the root of any algebraic equation with integer coefficients. It demonstrates for the mathematical constant e that if e were algebraic, this would imply a certain summation-integral expression involving e and its powers to be divisible by a prime number p, except for one specific case. That is shown to be contradictory, leading to the conclusion that e must be a transcendental number.

[Theorem 4: π is transcendental]
The last theorem asserts that just as with e, π must be transcendental as well. Again, we argue by contradiction that if π was algebraic, a certain complex exponential expression equaling 0 would lead to another integral expression being an integer multiple of a prime plus another fixed value, which clearly tends to 0 as the prime number approaches infinity, this completes the proof that π is indeed transcendental.

Therefore, in conclusion, these theorems have proven that both π and e are not only irrational but also transcendental. This highlights the profound relationships and properties of these important mathematical constants.

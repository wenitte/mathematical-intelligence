In this formal proof, we aim to provide a logical translation of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem in natural language. 

The Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem states that if we have distinct algebraic numbers α₁, ..., αₙ, and nonzero algebraic numbers β₁, ..., βₙ, then the expression β₁eᵃ¹ + ... + βₙeᵃⁿ cannot equal zero. 

To demonstrate this, we consider the function I(t), which is defined as the integral from 0 to t of e^(t-x)f(x)dx, where f(x) is the function we are working with. By using integration by parts a certain number of times (m times), we find that I(t) can be written in terms of a sum involving the first m derivatives of our function at 0 and t, all multiplied by e^t. 

Next, we consider a certain development of this function. If we rewrite the function f(x) as a sum over the terms aᵃxⁱ, we can define a new function F(x) as the similar sum over the absolute values |aᵢ|xⁱ. With this, we can bound the absolute value of I(t) by |t|e^t·F(|t|), using the integral of the absolute value of our function multiplied by e^(t-x) from 0 to t.

Then, we aim to show that the assumption that the number α is algebraic actually leads to a contradiction. For this, we place α in its exponential form and define J as the linear combination of the I-values. Deriving bounds for J, we get that the lower bound is (p-1)! and the upper one is Ce^p, where p is a prime number and C is some constant.

The key to this proof lies in a polynomial function, f(x), which is the product of (x-i)^p for i ranging from 1 to n. Here, p is a prime number that is large enough for the proof. 

The contradiction arises when p grows sufficiently large. We end up with (p-1)! > Ce^p, which is impossible. This pair of inequalities forms the heart of the contradiction argument, which shows that our initial assumption was wrong. 

This argument thus establishes the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem.

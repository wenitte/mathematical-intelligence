This is a formal proof of the distributive law of intersection over union in set theory. The distributive law states that the intersection of a set A with the union of sets B and C is equal to the union of the intersection of set A with set B and the intersection of set A with set C.

In simpler terms, it means that if you have three groups of items (A, B and C), finding the shared items in A, B, and C in two steps (first by combining B and C and then finding shared items with A) equals directly finding the shared items between A and B, and A and C, and then combining those. 

So, what this states is that you can 'distribute' the set A across the union of sets B and C, and the resulting groups of items (the intersection of A with each of B and C) are the same as if you'd just found the intersection of A with the union of B and C. 

This can be useful in many situations where we want to break down complex logical relationships into simpler ones.

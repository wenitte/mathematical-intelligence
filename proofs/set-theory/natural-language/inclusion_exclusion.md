This is a proof of the principle of inclusion-exclusion, a fundamental concept in combinatorics that gives a method for counting different things.

So, let's start with the left side of the equation. What 'inclusion-exclusion(A1, A2, ..., An)' means is that we are applying the principle of inclusion-exclusion to a number of sets which we'll label as A1 to An.

Moving on to the right side of the equation, this is broken down into a series of terms and the general pattern starts to emerge as we move from term to term.

The first term is the summation of the sizes of each of the individual sets, denoted as 'Σ|Ai|'. This term just means adding up the number of elements in each set Ai. This could be related to an everyday situation, like adding up all people in a number of different groups.

However, if some people belong to more than one group, then they would be counted twice which is not what we want. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of elements shared between each pair of two different sets. This corresponds to our second term 'Σ|Ai ∩ Aj|' ('∩' represents the intersection of two sets, or the elements they have in common). So, we subtract the people who are double counted.

But then if people are in three groups, we would have subtracted them out too many times, so we add back in the number of elements that are in all three of any three different sets, resulting in our third term 'Σ|Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak|'.

This pattern continues, with alternating subtraction and addition of the number of elements in the intersection of 1, 2, 3, ..., up to n sets. Hence the alternating (-1)^(n-1) sign for the nth term. This sign will change from addition (when n is even) to subtraction (when n is odd) as we progress the pattern to n sets.

The final term, 'Σ|A1 ∩ A2 ∩ ... ∩ An|', corresponds to the number of elements that exist in all of the sets.

In the end, the total count that we get after applying this inclusion-exclusion principle corresponds to the total of the elements in the union of these sets, or '|A1 ∪ A2 ∪ ... ∪ An|', without any double counting. 

That's a natural language explanation of this mathematical proof!

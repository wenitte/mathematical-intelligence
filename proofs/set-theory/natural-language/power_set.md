The proof is explaining the concept of a power set of a set A in mathematical set theory. 

The power set of a set A, denoted by power_set(A), is essentially a set of all possible subsets that can be derived from A. This includes the empty set and the set itself. 

Here, the statement is bi-conditional, with each part implying the other. 

In the first direction, it is saying that there exists a power set of A, denoted as P(A), which implies that for any subset X of A, X would necessarily be an element of this power set, P(A). Essentially, this captures the intuition that the power set of a set A should contain all possible subsets of A.

In the opposite direction, it's saying that if, for any collection of elements X, X is an element of the power set P(A) if and only if X is a subset of A, it then implies that P(A) is indeed the power set of A. Therefore, a set is a power set of A if all of its elements are subsets of A, and only subsets of A.

Therefore, the proposition defined by the above proof is essentially the definition of the concept of power sets in the language of formal mathematical logic.

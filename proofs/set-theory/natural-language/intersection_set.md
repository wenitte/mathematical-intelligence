The given proof states that a set is an intersection set of A and B if and only if there exists another set C such that any element X is a member of C if and only if X is a member of both A and B.

Breaking it down, we find that the proof is essentially saying two things:

1) If a set is an intersection set of A and B, then there will be a set C where any element X will belong to C only if it also belongs to both A and B. Here, set C is essentially the common part of A and B or the intersection of A and B.

2) Conversely, if there exists a set C in which any element X belongs to C only if it belongs to both A and B, then that set C will be an intersection set of A and B. In other words, if a set only contains elements that are found in both A and B, we can consider it to be their intersection set.

So, the proof is about defining what the intersection of two sets means, through the use of the hypothetical set C and its elements.

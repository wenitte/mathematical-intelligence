The axiom of union states that given a set A, there exists another set B, such that any element x belongs to set B if and only if there is a set Y within set A where x is an element of Y.

In simpler terms, it says that if you have a collection of sets called A, you can create a new set B. This new set B is made up of all the elements from all the sets in your original collection A.

The given proof is an equivalence operation showing the relationship between the union of two sets A and B and their individual complements. In natural language, this can be interpreted as follows:

The complement of the union of two sets, A and B, is equivalent to the intersection of the complements of the individual sets A and B.

Where the 'complement' of a set refers to all elements not in the set, the 'union' of two sets refers to all elements in either set, and the 'intersection' of two sets refers to all elements common to both sets. Therefore, all elements not in either set A or set B (complement_union(A, B)) are the same as all elements that are neither in set A nor in set B (A' âˆ© B').

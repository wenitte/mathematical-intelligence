This proof asserts Cantor's Theorem, which essentially states that the power set of any given set A (P(A)), i.e., the set of all its subsets, is always strictly greater than A itself.

To demonstrate this, we first consider any set, denoted by A. We create a function, represented by 'f', that maps each element 'a' from the set A to a single-element subset of P(A), i.e., {a}.

We further declare that this function f is injective, meaning that each distinct element of A corresponds uniquely to a distinct single-element subset of P(A). This is based on the supposition that if we map two different elements 'a1' and 'a2' from A, and their resulting single-element subsets are equal, the elements 'a1' and 'a2' must also be the same.

Next, we examine the contrary assumption that we might have a function 'g' that bijectively (both injectively and surjectively) maps A into its power set P(A).

To do this, we declare a set 'S', defined as the collection of elements from A that are not contained in their own image under g. Because the set S is formed from elements of A, it belongs to the power set P(A).

Given that 'g' is supposed to be bijective, there must be some element 'x' in A that maps to our defined set S. This claim leads to a contradiction since 'x' is a member of S if and only if 'x' is not a member of its image under g, which is equal to S itself. 

In other words, 'x' is a member of 'S' (and therefore not a member of its 'g' map) exactly when 'x' is not a member of 'S' (and thus a member of its 'g' map). This creates a logical inconsistency, and conclusively dispels our initial assumption of 'g' being bijective.

Therefore, no function can bijectively map a set A to the power set P(A). Consequently, the power set P(A) is always larger than the set A itself, thus proving Cantor's Theorem.

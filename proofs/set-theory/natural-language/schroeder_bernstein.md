This proof is explaining the Schroeder-Bernstein theorem, which essentially states that if there are two injective (or one-to-one) functions between two sets, then there's a bijective function (or one-to-one and onto) between the two sets. 

The proof begins by defining some sequences of subsets named Aₙ and Bₙ within the sets A and B by some rules involving f and g. The purpose of these sequences is to split up our sets A and B into two different parts: one which we can pair off using the function f and other one which we can pair off using the function g.

Next, we determine the 'limit' of these sequences, which we represent as Aω and Bω. This limit is basically the intersection of all the subsets involved in the sequences Aₙ and Bₙ. After these sets are defined, we confirm that they are indeed subsets of their respective sets A and B. 

The proof then proceeds to show that f, when restricted to Aω, is actually a bijection between Aω and Bω. This is done by showing that for every element in Aω, its image under f is in Bω, and vice versa; for every element in Bω, there is an element in Aω that maps to it. Because f is injective, this particular mapping is unique.

Along the same lines, the proof demonstrates that g, when restricted to the set difference B \ Bω, is a bijection between B \ Bω and A \ Aω. 

Now we have a bijection over two different parts of set A. The proof then combines these two parts into one by defining a function h. If an element is in Aω, we use f to map it to B; If an element is not in Aω, we map it to B using the inverse of g.

Lastly, we confirm that h is indeed a bijective function. We already know that f and g⁻¹ are bijective on their respective domains, so as a combination of these two, h is also bijective. 

Therefore, the proof concludes that if we have two injective functions from A to B and from B to A, it is indeed possible to find a bijection from A to B.

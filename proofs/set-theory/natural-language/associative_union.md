This proof is demonstrating the associative property of set union. In simpler terms, it's stating that when you take three sets - let's call them A, B, and C - and you first perform the union operation on sets A and B, and then take the union of that result with set C, it's the same thing as if you first perform the union of sets B and C, and then take the union of that result with set A. Essentially, it's showing that it doesn't matter how you group the sets when you're performing their union, the outcome will always be the same.

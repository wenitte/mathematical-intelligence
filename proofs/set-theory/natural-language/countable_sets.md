A set, A, is countable if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied:

1) A is finite. That is, there is a specific number of elements in A. For example, a set with 5 elements is finite.

2) There exists a bijective function, f, from set A to the set of natural numbers, ℕ. A function is bijective if each element in A matches up with a unique, distinct element in ℕ and vice versa. In simpler terms, every element of A has a distinct natural number as its partner, and every natural number has an element in A that corresponds to it.

So to put it all together, this proof states that any set is countable if it is finite or if it can be matched one-to-one with the set of natural numbers.

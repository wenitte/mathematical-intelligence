The proof is demonstrating the concept of the commutative property in the form of set union. It simply says that the order in which sets are united does not matter. So if you have two sets, A and B, the union of A and B (A ∪ B) is equal to the union of B and A (B ∪ A). This property is what defines the 'commutative union'. So whether you add elements of A to B or elements of B to A, the outcome will be the same. The order of operation does not change the end result.

The given proof is about the union of two sets, set A and set B. It proposes that the union of these two sets, denoted as union_set(A, B), can be defined as a new set, let's say set C. 

This new set, C, includes every element, X, which belongs to either A or B or even both. This is put across in the following way: For all elements X, X is in set C if and only if X is in set A or set B. 

In simple terms, all the elements from both sets A and B are included in a new set, C. This set C is the union of sets A and B. This comprises the key idea of the union of two sets in set theory.

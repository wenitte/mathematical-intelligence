This proof defines what disjoint sets are in mathematical terms, specifically using set theory. The notation 'disjoint_sets(A, B)' represents sets A and B being disjoint, which simply means they have no elements in common. 

The sign '↔' denotes 'if and only if' in logic, establishing a necessary and sufficient condition. This means that what follows is both a condition for and a consequence of the preceding statement. In other words, the two conditions are equivalent - each implies the other.

The expression '[A ∩ B = ∅]' represents that the intersection of sets A and B is an empty set ∅, which means that there are no elements that appear in both A and B. 

So, in basic English, this proof could be explained as: "A and B are said to be disjoint sets if and only if they have no elements in common, indicated by the intersection of A and B being an empty set. This is a two way condition - if A and B have no shared elements then they are disjoint, and they are only disjoint if they have no shared elements."

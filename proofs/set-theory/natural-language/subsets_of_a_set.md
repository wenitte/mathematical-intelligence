This proof discusses a theorem about the count of the set of all subsets (also called the power set) of a finite set. According to the theorem, if we have a set A with n elements - that is, the size of the set A (denoted |A|) is equal to n - then the size of the power set of A (denoted |P(A)|) is 2^n. 

Let's illustrate this using a concrete example where n=3. Suppose we have a set A={1, 2, 3}. We can count the subsets of A grouped by their size:

- There is 1 subset of size 0 (the empty set), which we can select from 3 elements in 3 ways with none chosen (3 choose 0), denoted ₃C₀.
- There are 3 subsets of size 1, which we can select from 3 elements in 3 ways with one chosen (3 choose 1), denoted ₃C₁.
- Likewise, there are 3 subsets of size 2 (3 choose 2), denoted ₃C₂.
- Finally, there is 1 subset of size 3 (3 choose 3), denoted ₃C₃.

If we add up the subsets by size, we have 1 (for size 0) + 3 (for size 1) + 3 (for size 2) + 1 (for size 3), which sums up to 8, and this is indeed the same as 2^3, providing an example of our theorem. 

To generalize, the number of subsets of a set of size n can be represented by the sum of n choose k from k=0 to n. This is actually part of the Binomial Theorem, which states that (1+x)^n equals to the sum of n choose k times x^k from k=0 to n. If we let x = 1 in this formula, we get that 2^n equals to the sum of n choose k from k=0 to n.

In conclusion, for any finite set A with size n, the size of its power set is 2^n, which is also the sum of n choose k from k=0 to n. And so, the theorem is proven.

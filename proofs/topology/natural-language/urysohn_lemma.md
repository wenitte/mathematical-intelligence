This statement can be interpreted in natural language as follows:

This is a description of Urysohn's Lemma, which is a fundamental concept in the field of topological spaces, particularly in relation to the concept of normal spaces. 

We start with defining 'X' as a normal space, which means that for any two disjoint closed subsets 'A' and 'B' of 'X', there exist disjoint open subsets that contain 'A' and 'B' respectively.

The lemma then tells us that there exists a continuous function 'f', that maps the space 'X' to the real interval from 0 to 1. This function has a property that for every element 'x' in the subset 'A', the function 'f' maps this 'x' to 0 while for every 'x' in the subset 'B', the function maps it to 1.

The construction 'C' refers to the process of finding a sequence of open sets 'U_r', for each rational number 'r' in the interval from 0 to 1. These sets obey the rule that if a rational number 'r' is less than another rational number 's', then the corresponding open set 'U_r' is a subset of 'U_s'. Furthermore, the set 'A' is a subset of each 'U_r', and the closure of each 'U_r' is a subset of 'U_s'. Here, the closure of a set includes all the points in the set along with its limit points. The function 'f' for a given 'x' is then defined as the infimum (greatest lower bound) of those 'r' such that 'x' belongs to 'U_r'.

This construction gives a characterization of normality, where a space 'X' is considered normal if and only if for every pair of disjoint closed subsets 'A' and 'B' of 'X', there can be found a function 'f' that separates 'A' and 'B' in this way. "Separating" here means that 'f' maps all points of 'A' to 0 and all points of 'B' to 1. In essence, the statement is saying that the normality of a space can be characterized by the existence of such a separating function for any pair of disjoint closed subsets.

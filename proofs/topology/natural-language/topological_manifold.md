This is a formal definition of a manifold according to mathematical theory, specifically concerning topology or the study of geometric spaces. Let's walk through it in simple language:

- Let's assume that we have M, a mathematical object that we call a 'manifold'. A 'manifold' is a space that looks locally like Euclidean space of a specific number of dimensions 'n'. 

- This means that for any point 'x' in the space 'X', you can find an open region 'U' around that point such that there is a homeomorphism – a continuous function that has a continuous inverse – denoted by φ from region U to a subset of Euclidean space of dimension n. A 'Hausdorff space' is an additional property of the space 'X' meaning any two distinct points in the space can be separated by neighborhoods.

- We define an atlas A on this manifold. An atlas is a collection of 'charts' – pairs of an open set and a homeomorphism φ - that cover the space 'X'. If the intersection of any two charts is not empty, the transition map – the composite function of φⱼ following the inverse of φᵢ – is also a homeomorphism.

- The manifold is 'second countable' if it has a countable atlas. In other words, this means that there is a countable collection of open sets that forms a basis for the topology of the space.

- The dimension of the manifold is 'n', represented by 'D'. For each point 'x', there's an open set 'U' around it that is homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space of dimension n. There should not be an open region 'V' that is homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space of different dimension 'm'.

To sum up, this is a formal explanation on the properties of a manifold - how it should locally look like Euclidean space, how an atlas covers this space, and the dimension of the space.

This formal mathematical proof is describing the equivalence between four concepts: net definition, convergence, subnet definition, and filter convergence in the context of topology and order theory. 

1. Net Definition: A net, N, is defined on a structure (D, ‚â§) which is required to be a directed set. The proof specifies three characteristics of a directed set. (i) Every element Œ± in the set is related to itself, that is, Œ± ‚â§ Œ±. (ii) The relation is transitive, i.e., if Œ± ‚â§ Œ≤ and Œ≤ ‚â§ Œ≥, then it implies that Œ± ‚â§ Œ≥. (iii) For any two elements Œ± and Œ≤ from D, there exists an element Œ¥ also in D which is greater than or equal to both of them.

2. Convergence: A net x, which is a function from set D to set X, converges to a point 'a' in set X, if it satisfies a specific condition. For every open set U that contains 'a', there exists an element Œ± in D such that all elements of set D that are greater than or equal to Œ± get mapped to the set U under the function x. 

3. Subnet Definition: A function y mapping from a set E to set X is a subnet of x (from D to X) if there exists a function œÜ mapping from E to D. The function y can be obtained by first applying œÜ and then x, and for all Œ± in D there exists a Œ≤ in E such that every element in E, which is larger than or equal to Œ≤, when mapped by œÜ, results in an element larger than or equal to Œ±. 

4.Filter Convergence: By a certain equivalence, a function x converges towards a specific element 'a' if and only if there exists a filter ùìï which also converges towards 'a'. Moreover, the set of elements in the range of function x, which are mapped from elements of set D that are larger than or equal to a certain Œ≤, is a member of ùìï. 

In simpler terms, these four concepts describe different aspects of ordered relations within topological systems and show how they are interconnected.

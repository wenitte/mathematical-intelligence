Here is a natural language explanation of these four formal proofs:

1. A topological space X is defined as first-countable, or first_countable_definition(F), if for any point x in X, there is a countable set {U‚Çô} of open sets such that for any open set U containing x, there is a positive integer n such that x is an element of the U‚Çô set which is a subset of U.

2. A topological space X is second-countable, or second_countable(S), if there exists a countable basis ùìë, composed of open sets {B‚Çô}, for X. A basis is a collection of sets from which you can generate the whole topology by taking unions.

3. A space X is metrizable_countable(M) if it is a metric space, meaning the distance between any two points is a real number (it adheres to two main principles: distances are non-negative and equals zero if and only if points are identical, and the triangle inequality holds). If X being a metric space implies it is first countable, the space X is metrizable and countable.

4. A sequence of points {x‚Çô} in a subset A of a first-countable topological space X, sequentially_converges(C) to a limit point in A if and only if every subsequence in A converges to the same limit point in A. This means that a sequence is considered convergent in A if every point in the sequence gets arbitrarily close to the limit point and stays close. Here, A is also assumed to be closed, meaning it contains all its limit points.

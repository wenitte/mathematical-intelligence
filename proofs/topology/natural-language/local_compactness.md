This proof is an argument in the abstract field of topology, which deals with the nature of space, continuity, and closeness without concerning with numerical detail. The proof states that:

1. A topological space (which is a generalisation of geometric concepts such as lines, planes, volumes) is defined as locally compact if for every point in the space, and for all open sets containing that point, there exists a compact set (kind of closed and bounded in some sense) which is a subset of the open set, such that the point is in the interior of this compact set.

2. This local compactness property forms the basis for the definition of one-point compactification, which is a way of extending a topological space by adding an extra 'point at infinity'. This method applies when the space is both locally compact and Hausdorff (which means that distinct points can be separated by neighbourhoods). The extended space is the union of the initial space and the added point, and it is equipped with a new topology that includes all the original open sets and all complements of compact subsets of the original space. The result is a new compact Hausdorff space.

3. The definitions of locally compact topological spaces can also give rise to the concept of 'regular neighbourhoods'. If a space is locally compact, then for each point in the space, there exists an open set and a compact set, such that the point lies in the open set which is entirely contained within the closure of its own set which in turn is a subset of the compact set.

4. The final part of the proof is that in a locally compact, Hausdorff space, every compact subset is also a closed set. That is, the set contains all its limit points, or equivalently, its complement is an open set.

In essence, this proof is linking various concepts in topology, showing that definitions and properties in these various scenarios can be derived from the foundational concept of a locally compact topological space.

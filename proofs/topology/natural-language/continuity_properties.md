Here we are explaining the concept of continuity of a function between metric spaces in four different ways: via the definition (C), pre-image of open sets (O), the sequential criterion (S) and the composition of continuous functions (K). 

For (C): This defines a function (f) between two metric spaces (X and Y). The function is continuous at a point (x₀) in X if and only if for all sufficiently small distances (ε > 0) in the Y space, there exists a distance (δ > 0) in the X space such that points within this distance of x₀ map within the desired difference from f(x₀) in Y.

(O) is equivalent to (C) and says that a function f is continuous if and only if for any open set U in Y, the preimage of U (set of points in X that map to U) is open in X. This is another way of phrasing the idea that small changes in X result in small changes in Y when f is continuous.

(S) also gives an equivalent condition to (C) for continuity of f at a point x₀. It states that if for any sequence {xₙ} in X that converges to x₀, the sequence {f(xₙ)} in Y also converges to f(x₀), then f is continuous at x₀. This is a statement about preserving limits of sequences under f.

Finally, (K) states that if we have two continuous functions (f and g), the composition of them (g ∘ f) is also continuous. It says that continuity works nicely with function composition. No matter how you put together continuous functions, the end result is still continuous.

These four theorems provide different perspectives on the concept of continuity which on the surface appear different but are all equivalent.

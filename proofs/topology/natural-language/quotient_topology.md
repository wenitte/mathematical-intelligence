In a simpler language, this proof can be understood as follows:

We begin by defining a quotient in a certain context. A quotient, noted as 'Q', can be defined if 'X' and 'Y' are topological spaces and 'p' is a surjective function from 'X' to 'Y'. The openness of a subset 'U' of 'Y' is defined in terms of the openness of the preimage of 'U', noted as 'p^-1(U)' in 'X'. That is, 'U' is open in 'Y' if and only if its preimage 'p^-1(U)' is open in 'X'. 

Given this, we can define what we call the 'universal property', noted as 'U'. This property states that if there is a continuous function 'f' from 'X' to some other topological space 'Z' and this function 'f' gives the same value for any two points 'x1' and 'x2' in 'X' when they are related by 'p' (that is, 'p(x1)' equals 'p(x2)'), then there must exist a unique continuous function 'g' from 'Y' to 'Z' such that the composition of 'g' and 'p' equals 'f'. In other words, 'g' followed by 'p' will give the same result as if we applied 'f' directly.

Lastly, the 'inheritance property', denoted 'I', discusses the transfer of topological properties from 'X' to 'Y' via function 'p'. If X is compact, then Y is also compact. If X is connected, then Y is also connected. Additionally, the preimage under 'p' of any point 'y' in 'Y' is compact. This implies that function 'p' is a closed map, meaning that it maps closed sets in 'X' to closed sets in 'Y'.

In summary, this proof talks about the properties of quotient topologies, specifically how open sets, continuous functions, and topological properties like compactness and connectedness are related and preserved during the process of quotienting.

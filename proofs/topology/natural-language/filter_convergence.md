This proof is defining formal concepts related to set theory and topology in a simple English language.

The first condition defines a "filter" on a set X. A filter denoted here as 𝓕, is a subset of the power set of X (all possible subsets of X) with the following properties: 
1. The empty set isn't in it.
2. If you take any two sets from 𝓕, their intersection is also in 𝓕. 
3. If you have a set A in 𝓕, and a set B superset of A, then B is also in 𝓕.

Then the proof shows "convergence" of a point x in X to a filter. Here, a point x in X converges to a filter 𝓕 if for every open set U containing x, U is an element of 𝓕.

Then it defines what an "ultrafilter" is. It basically is a filter that is maximal (cannot be made bigger while still being a filter), with an added condition: For any subset A of X, either A is in the filter, or the set of all points in X but not in A (denoted as (X\A)) is in the filter. This means for any division of the set X, either one part or the other part is "selected" by the filter.

Finally, the proof gives the concept of "compactness" of a set in term of filters, saying that a subset X of a topological space is compact if, for every filter 𝓕 on X, there exists a point x in X that 𝓕 converges to. In simpler words, if every filter on X converges to some point in X, then we call X a compact set.

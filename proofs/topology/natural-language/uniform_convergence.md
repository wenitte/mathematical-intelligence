Sure, let's break down this formal proof into everyday language.

Firstly, we are provided a definition for 'uniform convergence'. A sequence of functions {fₙ} from X to Y is said to uniformly converge to a function f (written {fₙ}⇒f), if for any chosen small difference (ε > 0), there comes a point in the sequence (some N in our natural numbers) beyond which, the distance between fₙ(x) and f(x) (this distance is measured using a given metric d), is less than the chosen difference, for all x in the set X.

The 'pointwise_weaker' property asserts that the idea of pointwise convergence is indeed weaker than uniform convergence. That is, while every sequence of functions {fₙ} that converges uniformly ensured that for every point x in set X, the function values at x (fₙ(x)) also converge, it can always find a sequence {fₙ} where for every x the function values fₙ(x) converge, but {fₙ} does not necessarily converge uniformly.

The 'continuity_preservation' property states that if each function in our sequence {fₙ} is continuous, and if {fₙ} does converge uniformly to f on a compact set X, then the limit function f is guaranteed to be continuous as well.

Finally, the 'composition_uniform' indicates that if we have our sequence of functions {fₙ} converging uniformly to a function f and another continuous function g (from Y to another set Z), the composite functions g ∘ fₙ also converges uniformly to the composite function g ∘ f.

In everyday terms, this proof could be about how a series of actions or processes (represented here by functions) can gradually get closer and closer to an ideal or perfect action. If the individual actions are consistent (continuous), and they're getting close to the ideal in a uniform and not piecemeal way, then the final action is also consistent. Also, this consistency can be maintained when combined with another consistent series of actions or process.

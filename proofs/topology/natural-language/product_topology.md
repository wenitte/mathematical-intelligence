This proof describes the properties of a product space, and its relationship with basis sets, the universal property, and compactness in the context of topology.

First, we start by defining a product space. Given a family of spaces {(X·µ¢,œÑ·µ¢)} where each i comes from an index set I, the product of these spaces, denoted by X, is a set comprised of all possible collections {(x·µ¢)_{i‚ààI}} such that each x·µ¢ belongs to X·µ¢. The projection function œÄ‚±º maps any point in X to its j-th component x‚±º.

Next, we define a basis for the topology of the product space X. The basis ùìë is a set of all possible products of the form {‚àè{U·µ¢ : i ‚àà I}} such that each U·µ¢ is in œÑ·µ¢. There is a finite subset F of I such that U·µ¢ = X·µ¢ for all i not in F.

Then we state the universal property of the product space. A function f from a topological space (Y,œÉ) to X is "continuous" if and only if for every index i in I, the composition of the projection function œÄ·µ¢ and f, i.e., œÄ·µ¢ ‚àò f, is also "continuous".

Finally, we talk about the compactness property in the product space context. The product space X={‚àè{X·µ¢ : i ‚àà I}} is "compact", if and only if each of the spaces X·µ¢ in the family is compact for every index i in I. Additionally, the cardinality of the index set I is less than aleph-null (‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ), which is the smallest size of infinity in set theory and represents the number of "countable" elements.

Hence, the proof has formally described the properties of the product topology in terms of basis, universal property, and compactness.

This proof can be explained in natural language as follows:

The proof begins with the definition of a connected topological space. It says that a topological space X can be considered disconnected if it can be partitioned into two open subsets U and V that are both non-empty and disjoint. If such a partitioning is possible, then X is considered NOT connected.

Then the proof establishes correlation between continuity and connectivity through a function 'f'. This notion asserts that if there exists a continuous function 'f' that maps X to Y, and if X is a connected space, then the image of that function (f(X)) also has to be connected in Y.

The subsequent proposition is based on the concept of an interval. It states that any interval [a,b] on the real number line, where 'a' is less than 'b', is a connected set.

The final part of the proof introduces the principle of maximal connectedness of a component. It states that if there are two sets 'C' and 'D' in the topological space X wherein C is a subset of D and both are connected sets, then, for C to be the maximal connected subset, according to the definition of a connected component, 'C' must be equal to 'D'. This can be considered as the idea of a maximal element where none other is greater than 'C' that still lies within 'D' when 'D' is connected.

The proof is basically establishing the equivalence of certain important concepts related to metric spaces. For simplicity, let's break it down piece by piece:

1) The first part related to sequential compactness is saying that a set 'S' is sequentially compact if and only if (iff) the following holds true: if you start with any sequence of points within a given metric space 'X', there exists a sub-sequence of this original sequence that converges to some point in 'X'.

2) The second part related to total boundedness implies that a set 'T' is totally bounded if and only if (iff) no matter how small an 'epsilon' value you choose (greater than zero), you can always find a finite number of points within 'X' that can appropriately cover the entire set 'X' with open 'epsilon' balls.

3) The third part related to completeness indicates that a set is considered complete if and only if (iff) any Cauchy sequence of points (a sequence where the distance between terms eventually becomes arbitrarily small) within 'X' is guaranteed to converge to some point in 'X'.

Finally, the proof states that these are all equivalent, such that a metric space 'X' is compact iff it's both complete and totally bounded, which is the same as saying that 'X' is sequentially compact, meaning every sequence in 'X' has a subsequence that converges to a limit in 'X'.

So, in simpler terms, we have established that in the world of metric spaces, being compact, complete and totally bounded, and sequentially compact are actually three ways of describing the same phenomenon.

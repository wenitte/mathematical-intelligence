This proof is explaining in a formal manner how one should define a metric space, a ball in that space, and a topology induced by that metric.

1. The Proof starts by defining a "metric", denoted as 'd'. It's a type of function that takes two points from a set (in this case, the set X) and outputs a real number. This definition of a metric comes with some conditions that it must meet: 
- Firstly, the distance between two points must be greater than or equal to zero, and it can only equal zero if and only if the two points are actually the same point.
- Secondly, the order of the points doesn't matter; the distance measurement will be the same regardless (i.e., the distance from x to y equals the distance from y to x).
- Lastly, the distance between two points can not be more than the sum of the distances of those two points to a third point.

2. The proof then introduces the concept of an "open ball", denoted as B. It's defined as all the points in set X that are within a certain distance, denoted as 'r', from a specified point 'x'. This 'r' has to be a positive number.

3. Finally, it talks about a "topology", symbolized as 'T'. A topology is a way of characterizing which sets in X are "open". According to this definition, a set is open if for every point in the set, you can find a positive 'r' where the open ball centered at that point with radius 'r' is entirely contained within the set.  

So to put it all together, this proof is formally outlining the definitions of metric, open ball and topology, and showing how they relate to each other. The topology is defined by the open balls, which in turn are based on the metric measurement.

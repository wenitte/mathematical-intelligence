This theorem provides a solution to a quartic equation, or a polynomial equation of degree 4, in the form x⁴ + c₃x³ + c₂x² + c₁x + c₀ = 0.

First, it rewrites this equation in a biquadratic form, or a polynomial that is a square of quadratics, such that the two sides are equal. This step is composed of various equations and conditions, for instance, the agreement between corresponding terms of the two forms and specific solutions for 'a₁', 'a₀', and 'b₀'.

Next, from the biquadratic form, the proof derives what is known as the resolvent equation, which includes multiple solutions for 'w'. The primary goal here is to transform the quartic equation into its related cubic equation called the resolvent cubic equation, which is easier to solve in general.

From here, the proof simplifies this cubic equation into a reduced or depressed cubic equation form that expresses it in terms of 'y', 'p', and 'q'. Again, various equations and conditions are provided to express these terms and the intermediary 'w' in terms of the initial coefficients 'c₀', 'c₁', 'c₂', 'c₃', etc.

Further, the proof establishes the discriminant formula. The discriminant is a specific function of coefficients of the polynomial which is zero if and only if the polynomial has multiple roots, or, in other words, if there are 'x' values for which the polynomial equals zero.

After this, quadratic factors are used to revise the equation, using the previously defined 'w' with roots based on numerous conditions.

Finally, this leads us to the root solutions for the original quartic equation. These are provided as four values, which are the solutions, or the possible values of 'x' that would satisfy the polynomial equation we started with. Each root is represented in terms of 'c' coefficients and 'w', which had been previously determined.

Summarizing, this proof is a systematic process of transforming and simplifying the original quartic equation into simpler forms, ultimately leading to the solutions of the polynomial.

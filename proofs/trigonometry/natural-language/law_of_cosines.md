The given theorem is known as the Law of Cosines. It establishes a relationship between the sides and angles of a triangle in two-dimensional real number space, often denoted as ℝ².

More specifically, it tells us that the square of the length of one side of the triangle (|BC|², where |BC| is the distance between points B and C) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (|AB|² and |AC|², where |AB| and |AC| represent the distances between points A and B, and A and C, respectively), minus twice the product of these two sides |AB| and |AC|, multiplied by the cosine of the included angle ∠BAC (meaning the angle at A formed by lines BA and AC).

The definitions included in the reasoning further clarify how measurements are made:

- |PQ| is defined as the distance between any two points P and Q. It is computed using the distance formula: the square root of the sum of squares of differences in their x-coordinates (x₂-x₁) and y-coordinates (y₂-y₁).
- The angle ∠BAC is defined as the arc cosine of the dot product of vectors AB and AC divided by the product of their magnitudes. This formula is derived from the geometric definition of the dot product in terms of the magnitudes of the vectors and the angle between them.

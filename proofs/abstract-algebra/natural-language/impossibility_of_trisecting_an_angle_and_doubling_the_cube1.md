This proof is demonstrating two key principles: one concerning constructible numbers and their degrees over the rationals, and another related to θ, the minimum polynomial degree, and the cubic roots. Let's break it down.

Firstly, the proof establishes that for every constructible number r, it must satisfy the requirement that 2^n, where 'n' is a natural number, defines its degree over the rationals. The notation [ℚ(r):ℚ] is used to represent the degree of the extension of the rational number field ℚ by the number r. That's to say, this indicates how much "larger" the field ℚ(r) is in comparison to ℚ itself.

Then, it posits that if the cosine of θ/3 is an algebraic number, its minimal polynomial degree will always be 3 over the field of ℚ(cos(θ)). The minimal polynomial of a number is the lowest degree polynomial that the number satisfies. So, this states that if we include cos(θ/3) in our number field, then some polynomial of degree 3 will have cos(θ/3) as a root.

Thirdly, it asserts that for any number 'r' that is the cubic root of some rational number 'x', the degree of r over the rational numbers is always 3. Basically, this communicates the idea that cubic roots make the rational number field "3 times larger".

This is then followed by a key mathematical assertion: the number 3 does not divided 2^n for any 'n' in natural numbers. 

The final statement concludes that if θ does not constitute a multiple of π and the cosine of θ is a rational number, then cosine of θ/3 is not constructible. In addition, if 'x' is a rational number, then its cubic root (∛x) is not constructible either. 

In essence, this part is using the facts that we've established to argue that certain numbers are not constructible, namely cos(θ/3) under certain conditions and the cubic root of any rational number.

The proof of Lagrange's theorem can be understood in the following way:

The theorem concerns finite groups and one of their subgroups. Let's label the group as G and the subgroup as H. The size of these groups is denoted as |G| and |H|. The theorem states that the size of any subgroup divides the size of the group. In other words, if our group G has n elements and our subgroup H has m elements, then n is a multiple of m.

The proof of Lagrange's theorem starts by considering the set of all cosets of the subgroup H in the group G. A coset of H is a certain kind of subset of G that is obtained by taking all the possible products of a fixed element from G and every element from H. Each element of G belongs to one and only one coset. Furthermore, all cosets have same number of elements, m, which is the size of the subgroup H.

The cosets form a partition of the group G. This means G is the union of disjoint cosets. Given that each coset of H has equally many elements, the total number of elements of G, n, is the product of the number of cosets and the number of elements in each coset, which is m elements in each coset times the number of cosets, denoted as r, making n equal to m times r.

Simultaneously, due to the unique partitioning into cosets, if there are r such cosets, r is also the index of H in G, often written as r = (G: H), which essentially says that group G has r times as many elements as subgroup H.

In conclusion, since the size of the group G is expressible as a product of the size of its subgroup H and r (a natural number), it can be said that size of any subgroup of a finite group divides the size of the group. This is what signifies Lagranges's theorem.

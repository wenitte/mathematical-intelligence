This is a proof explanation of Sylow’s Theorems in group theory.

Let us assume that we are given a group 'G' of order p^k * m, where 'p' is a prime number and 'm' is a positive integer such that p and m are co-prime — meaning, they have no common factors aside from 1. 

We want to show that this group has a subgroup of order p^k. To demonstrate this, we consider all subsets 'S' of group 'G' with a size of p^k. The total number of such subsets is equal to "G choose p^k".

We then propose that the group 'G' acts on these subsets through a process known as right multiplication. There must exist at least one subset 'X' in 'S' such that X’s order mod p ≠ 0. The stabilizer of X in G, which we'll denote as 'P', has an order of p^k, marking it as a Sylow p-subgroup of G.

Moving forward, if we have any two Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted P₁ and P₂, the group G acts on the set of all its Sylow p-subgroups through a process called conjugation. This means there exists an element 'g' in G such that when we apply the operation gP₁g⁻¹, we will get P₂. This proves that P₁ is conjugate to P₂.

Now, if n_p denotes the number of these Sylow p-subgroups of G, the index of a subgroup P in G (which essentially expresses the number of left cosets of P in G) is equivalent to n_p.

Finally, this proof concludes with two observations: n_p is congruent to 1 mod p (i.e., n_p leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by p), and n_p is a divisor of m. This wraps up the proof of Sylow’s Theorems.

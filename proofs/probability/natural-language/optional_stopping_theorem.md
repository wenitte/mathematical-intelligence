The theorem we're talking about essentially tells us that for a consistent sequence of random variables Xₙ, if these variables form a martingale (a sequence where the expected value of the next term, given all previous terms, is equal to the current term) and they are uniformly integrable, and if the stopping time T (a random time at which a certain event of interest occurs) allows us to stop the sequence, then the expected value (E) of the initial state is equal to the expected value at the stopping time, assuming that the absolute value of the stopped sequence is bounded and T is almost surely finite (T occurs with likelihood 1).

Delving into the proof, we first consider a modified version of the stopping time, T_∧n, which is simply the minimum of T and n. By Lemma 4.1, the expected value of the sequence at this time can be represented as the sum of three separate expectations: the expectation at T_∧n, the expectation of our sequence at the adjusted time weighted for when T exceeds n, and the expectation of the sequence at T_∧n again, but this time also weighted for the chance of T exceeding n. 

We then analyze two potential scenarios: the time T being less than or equal to n and T being greater than n. In both cases, we find that our original sequence's behavior at time T can also be represented as the aforementioned trio of expectations, which confirms our lemma.

Proceeding with Proposition 4.2, we find that the expected value at our modified stopping time is equal to the initial expected value for all natural numbers n. This is due to our sequence being a martingale and the fact that our adjusted time meets the conditions for a stopping time.

Finally, we bring together our lemma and proposition to conclude the theorem. As we extend our n to infinity, the latter two expectations in Lemma 4.1 vanish to 0 due to the properties of our sequence that allow for uniform integrability and our modified stopping time. Using the Dominated Convergence Theorem, a theorem on limit exchange for expected values, we find that the expected value at time T equals to the limit of the expected value at T_∧n, which is also equal to the expected value at the start, E(X₀). Thus, the theorem is confirmed.

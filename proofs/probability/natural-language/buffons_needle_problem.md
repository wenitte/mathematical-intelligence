This mathematical proof, known as Buffon's Needle Problem, is a classic example of geometric probability which links the mathematical constant pi with the probability of a certain event. 

Here's what it means in more common language:

We setup this problem by imagining a real two-dimensional plane with vertical strips. We define vertical lines where x equals any integer. We've got a needle of length 1. We introduce an angle θ, which can be anything from -π/2 to just less than π/2. 

We also have two events:
1. E signifies the event of the needle crossing a vertical line.
2. Θ_θ is the event of a needle being dropped at an angle θ.

We proceed to analyse the probability of these events. For any given angle θ in the range of -π/2 to less than π/2, our needle crosses the vertical line if the horizontal deviation of its midpoint is less than or equal to the cosine of the angle of drop. Thus, the conditional probability of event E given event Θ_θ is equal to cos(θ). 

Moving forward, if θ is a continuous random variable, the overall probability of the needle crossing a line, denoted Pr(E), is the integral of the product of conditional probability of E given Θ_θ and the probability density function of Θ_θ, over the entire range of θ. 

If we assume that θ has a uniform distribution (where every angle is equally likely), the probability density function of Θ_θ is 1/π. This gives us the integral of cos(θ) times 1/π over the range from -π/2 to π/2 as the expression for Pr(E).

Next, we calculate this integral. We know that the integral of cos(θ) is sin(θ) (which is its antiderivative). Applying the limits of the integral -π/2 and π/2 and multiplying by the constant 1/π, we get Pr(E) in terms of sine. 

The sine of π/2 is 1 and the sine of -π/2 is -1. Substituting these into our expression gives us Pr(E) as 1/π times (1 minus (-1)). This simplifies to Pr(E) equal to 2/π.

So, the final result is that the probability that the needle crosses a line, designated as Probability(E), is 2/π. This means that if you were to drop a unit-length needle onto a plane with parallel lines spaced a unit-length apart, the likelihood of the needle crossing a line is exactly 2/π.

This proof builds upon several fundamental concepts in probability theory to reach its ultimate conclusion. I'll do my best to explain each step as intuitively as possible.

Chebyshev's theorem is a widely used inequality in probability theory which states that for any random variable X and any positive real number a, the probability that the absolute value of X, P(|X| ≥ a), is at most the expected value of X², E(X²), divided by a².

Next, we generalize Chebyshev's Theorem. This means that instead of squaring the absolute value of X, we're raising X by any positive power, p. The probability that the absolute value of X, P(|X| ≥ a), is at most the expected value of X raised to the p, E(X^p), divided by a to the p, a^p.

We then define a series (X₁, X₂, ...) of independent, identically distributed (iid) random variables where every variable Xⱼ has the same expected value (μ) and variance (σ²). We define Sₙ as the sum of those variables and S*ₙ as the normalized sum of those variables subtracted by the μ (mean). As per the weak law, the mean (expected value) of S*ₙ is always 0, while the variance of S*ₙ is σ²/n.

Next, we use Borel-Cantelli lemma. This lemma concerns sequences of events (Aₙ) in a probability space, specifically unions of those events that diminish over time. If the sum of probabilities of these events is a finite number, then the probability of the limit supremum (maximal limit point) of those events is 0.

Our ultimate goal is to prove the Strong Law of Large Numbers. We define a set ℰ that consists of outcomes ω which align with the proportion law. Specifically, for these outcomes, the ratio of sum Sₙ to the number of terms n, will approach μ as n goes to infinity. We make three assumptions for this proof: 
1. The variance σ² is finite.
2. The expected value of the absolute value of the first term is finite.
3. The mean μ equals to 0.

Then we use a four-stage proof strategy. For any given ε > 0:

1. We show that the probability of the sum Sₙ becoming larger than nε infinitely often (i.e., without limit) is 0. This is done by applying the Chebyshev inequality with power of 4.
2. We calculate the fourth power of the expected value of the sum of Sₙ. It is shown to be a quadratic function in terms of n and the fourth power of variance σ⁴.
3. We bound the fourth power of the expected value of Sₙ to be at most a constant times n² for large enough n.
4. By taking into account convergence properties of series, we show that the sum of probabilities of the sum of Sₙ being no less than nε is finite. 

Combining all these stages with the Borel–Cantelli lemma, we reach the conclusion that the probability of ℰ is 1. Basically, almost every outcome belongs to the set ℰ. This establishes the Strong Law of Large Numbers. The proof is now complete.

The Newton-Puiseux theorem corresponds to a large body of work related to power series and their applications in algebraic geometry. The proof starts by establishing some definitions. 

1. C[[z]] is defined as the formal power series ring over the field C, essentially it's the set of all possible power series with coefficients in C. 
2. C{z} is defined as the convergent power series ring over C, a subset of all power series that actually converge to a value in C. 
3. C((z)) is the quotient field of C[[z]], the set of fractions where the numerator and denominator are formal power series. 
4. Similarly, C({z}) is the quotient field of C{z}. 
5. C[[z*]] is the formal Puiseux series ring over C, this allows for fractional exponents in the power series. 
6. C{z*} is the convergent Puiseux series ring over C. 

The definition of a Puiseux series f is given as one where there's a natural number r such that f(z) equals f(z^(1/r)). Here, order(φ, n, r) is defined as a series φ(z) = Σ_{k≥n} a_k·z^(k/r) where the k=n term is non-zero.

Following, the 'Elementary Symmetric' lemma is introduced. Basically, it guarantees for each element f in C[[z]] and each natural number r, a function Q(z,T), the product of differences between T and f(ε_r^i·z), results in a monic polynomial with coefficients in C[[z^r]].

The theorem then states that for any monic and irreducible polynomial P in C[[z*]][T], with deg(P) = n for some natural number n, there exists a positive rational q such that a sequence of transformations can be constructed (involving substitutions and transformations into new variables w, U) which lead to a relationship between P and Q, a polynomial with certain properties. With the help of Hensel's lemma, this polynomial can be split into two others, finally leading to a product relationship between P and the power series φ = g(z^(1/n)) under certain conditions.

Furthermore, the theorem also confirms that both C((z*)) and C({z*}) are algebraically closed, meaning every non-constant polynomial in these rings has a root in the corresponding ring. 

In conclusion, through the application of these definitions, lemmas, and logic, the theorem statement is proved.

This proof is complex and involves a lot of mathematical and technical logic. Here's the breakdown of it explained for a general audience:

The proof proposes that for any formal system F (like some mathematical systems): if this formal system contains Q (a specific set of axioms), and is also consistent (it does not contain any contradicting rules), then there exist some statements (we call this GF, or Gödel's formula) which are independent of this formal system. Here, Independent means that neither the formula nor its negation can be proved within the system F.

This proof is based upon a few existing proven lemmas and principles: 

1. For every statement A, its encoding in the system F, represented as '⌜A⌝', is a natural number.

2. The relation PrfF(x, y), which means, 'x is a Gödel number of a proof of y in F.'

3. ProvF(y) means that there is a proof in F of y. This condition holds if and only if there exists some 'x' in the natural numbers that fits PrfF(x, y). 

4. There's a principle known as the Diagonalization Lemma. It assures us that if ¬ProvF(x) can be expressed in the system F, then there exists a formula, GF, such that GF is logically equivalent to ¬ProvF(⌜GF⌝). 

Then, the proof demonstrates two contradictions:

1. If GF could be provable, then its Gödel number would have a proof in the system. But by the definition of GF, it follows that GF is equivalent to the negation of the assertion that GF's Gödel number can be proved. This leads to a contradiction: simultaneously having proof of GF and not having proof of GF.

2. In a similar way, if the negation of GF could be provable, then the Gödel number of the negation of GF would have a proof in the system. But from the definition of GF, it follows that GF is equivalent to the assertion that its Gödel number cannot be proved. This leads to a contradiction: simultaneously having proof of negation of GF and not having proof of negation of GF.

The proof finally establishes that, if neither GF nor the negation of GF can be proved (which is the case due to above contradictions), then the formula GF is independent of F.

Thus, the proof establishes that for certain types of formal systems, it's possible to construct a statement that is neither provable nor disprovable within the system itself, revealing the inherent limitations of formal systems.

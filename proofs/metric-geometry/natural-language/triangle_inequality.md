This theorem is known as the Triangle Inequality theorem. In common language terms, it states that for any real numbers represented as coordinates (x₀,y₀), (x₁,y₁), and (x₂,y₂), the distance from (x₀,y₀) to (x₁,y₁) is always equal to or less than the sum of the distances from (x₀,y₀) to (x₂,y₂) and from (x₂,y₂) to (x₁,y₁). In simpler terms, in any triangle, the length of one side is always less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.

This proof can be explained in everyday language as follows:

The proof establishes a relationship between a series called the inverse sine series and a specific mathematical function for which the absolute value of x is equal to or less than 1; this relationship is denoted in the statement (S = {t : t = Σ_{n=0}^∞ [(1 * 3 * ... * (2n-1)) / (2 * 4 * ... * (2n)) * x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)] ∧ |x| ≤ 1}).

The establishment of the inverse sine series is dependent on another set T, which includes all t for which t equals the inverse sine of x and t falls within the range between 0 and π/2.

Applying a recursive formula, we solve certain integrals involving sin(x) to a power of 2n+1 from 0 to π/2 to get to the sequence of integral values, I, where each element is a previously calculated integral minus the result of a new integration of sin(x)^(2n-1) * cos(x) from 0 to π/2.

Integration by parts is then used to relate all elements in the sequence I to other elements in the sequence, specifically showing that (2n+1)/(2n) * I_(2n+1) equals I_(2n-1).

With the recursive relation, we're reducing the formula from the integration by parts to get a simpler expression for I_(2n+1), which equals (2n / (2n+1)) * (2(n-1) / (2n-1)) * I_(2n-3).

Following that we compute the explicit value of the I sequence members as I_(2n+1) = [(2 * 4 * ... * (2n)) / (3 * 5 * ... * (2n+1))] through the explicit formula.

Then, it is implied that the integral of t between 0 and π/2 over our set T is equivalent to the series (1 / (2n+1)^2) summed from n=0 to ∞, which is also shown to equals π^2 / 8. 

Finally, we reach the end where we see the well-known result that the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of all positive integers (denoted ζ(2)) is equal to π^2 / 6. This relationship is established in the proof by comparing the sum of the series to the integral of t over the set T. 

In essence, this proof demonstrates power series, integral computation, recursion, and finally implies a well-established result of a summation involving the reciprocals of squared positive integers.

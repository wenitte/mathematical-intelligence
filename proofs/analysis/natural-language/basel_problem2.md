This is a formal proof that employs a series of mathematical definitions, transformations, and theorems to ultimately demonstrate the celebrated Basel problem in calculus and series summations, which states that the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers is equal to pi squared divided by six.

The proof begins with two foundational equivalences. The principle of monotone convergence, which says that in certain conditions an infinite sum can be represented as an integral of a function. This is equated with a specific double integral. A second equivalence is made between another integral representation and the sum of reciprocals of square numbers.

Continuing, it introduces a change of variables in the integral, shifting from x and y to u and v, to help simplify the expressions. Following these substitutions, the proof proceeds by identifying a region of integration in the uv-plane, termed the symmetric square. This region possesses symmetry about the line y=0.

The proof then cleverly decomposes this area into two triangles. This is crucial for the subsequent steps which involve converting the double integral over this region into a more tractable single integral form.

The double integral is then rewritten or transformed into a form that involves two separate single integrals over specific intervals. This transformation is achieved by dividing the previously mentioned triangles into two portions.

After the split, a substitution is made to simplify the integral further. This involves using trigonometric identities to represent the integral in terms of basic trigonometric functions. This eventually leads to the variable u being expressed in terms of the angle theta.

Finally, the last step of the proof is evaluating these integrals, which yields two separate values that represent fractions of pi squared. When these are combined, the sum of the infinite series is shown to equal pi squared divided by six.

The result, the sum of (1 over n-squared) for all natural numbers n, equals pi squared over six, is an elegant and celebrated result in mathematics. It was first proved by Swiss mathematician Euler in the 18th century.

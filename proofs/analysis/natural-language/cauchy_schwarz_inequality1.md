The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, essentially, states that the sum of the products of the individual elements in two sets (let's say vectors) squared, is less than or equal to the product of the sums of the squares of the individual elements in the two sets. Moreover, the only instance where equality holds is when one set is a scalar multiple of the other. 

Let's break the proof into parts to understand it better:

1. **Assumption:** Start by assuming that we have two sets a and b, each consisting of n real numbers.

2. **Expansion and Setup:** The next step is to define a function z(t), which stands for the sum of the squares of the difference of corresponding elements in the two sets multiplied by a factor 't'. Due to the nature of squares, this function will always be greater or equal to zero. Further, the function can be expanded to differentiate between the constant, linear, and quadratic terms. We also label these terms (summation of the square of elements, product terms, and cross product terms) as A, B, and C for simplicity.

3. **Discriminant Analysis:** The inequality to be proved essentially requires that the quadratic function z(t) has no real root, which is asserted by asserting that the discriminant (the part under the square root in the quadratic formula) of the quadratic equation must be less than or equal to zero. Simplifying the discriminant leads to the conclusion that the square of C (the cross product term) must be less than or equal to the product of A and B (the sum of squares terms).

4. **Final Result:** Substituting back the meanings of A, B, and C, we get the final form of the inequality. The sum of the products of individual elements in the two sets squared is less than or equal to the product of the sums of squares of the individual elements in the two sets.

5. **Equality Condition:** The only case where equality can hold is when the function z(t) becomes 0 for some 't'. That is possible only when one set a is a scalar multiple of the other set b. Therefore, introducing a scalar Î» ensures this condition is met.

And that's the proof. The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality is a fundamental result in mathematics, having wide-ranging implications in several branches like algebra, geometry, and analysis.

This proof begins with the definition of a function f, which is the series obtained by summing the value of cosine(nt) divided by n squared, from n equals 1 to infinity. 

The proof then rewrites a term connected with sine, equating the sum of sine(nt), from n equals 1 to N, to another similar sum, derived by description using complex numbers. 

It manipulates this sum a bit more to simplify the expression within it. 

The proof then states that the absolute value of the sum of sine(nt) divided by n, from n equals 1 to N, is less than or equal to 2 divided by the absolute value of 1 minus e to the power of it. This is then equated to 1 divided by sin(t/2), which shows that the series of sin(nt) divided by n is bounded.

The proof next says that this bounded sum of sin(nt) divided by n is uniformly convergent according to Dirichlet's test. This is a demonstration that the conditions of the convergence test are satisfied, ensuring the series converges for all points in the interval.

The proof then determines the derivative of the function f, showing it to be the negative of the sum of sin(nt) divided by n from n equals 1 to infinity. It demonstrates this through some transformations, concluding with a simplification of the expression as (t - π) / 2.

Following, we integrate the derivative of f with respect to t from 0 to π. Integrating ((t - π) / 2) over this interval yields -π^2 / 4.

Finally, the proof presents a relationship with the Riemann Zeta function at 2, ζ(2). The proof asserts that f(0) equals ζ(2), and that f(π) equals the sum from n equals 1 to infinity of ((-1)^n / n^2), which is the alternating negative and positive fractions with n squared in the denominator, which equals -ζ(2). 

This leads to the result, that ζ(2) is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of natural numbers, i.e., ζ(2) equals π^2 / 6. Thus, the original function and the Zeta function are intimately connected, leading to an interesting result linking trigonometric, complex and number-theoretic techniques.

The theorem being discussed, often referred to as the Fourier series theorem, proposes that any given function 'f' that is mapped from real numbers to real numbers, and has a periodicity 'T', can be represented as a sum of sine and cosine functions. This summation, typically known as the Fourier series, involves a constant term and two series, where each term of the series is multiplied by coefficients 'aₙ' and 'bₙ', and the functions cosine and sine, which are functions of variables 'n', 'ω₀', and 'x'.

Now, if we have a function 'f' that is both mapped from real numbers to real numbers and periodic, we begin by defining 'ω₀' as the ratio of 2π and 'T'. Afterwards, we have to define our coefficients 'a₀', 'aₙ', and 'bₙ' which hinges on the integral of our function 'f' and, for 'aₙ' and 'bₙ', the cosine and sine functions respectively.

The essence of the proof involves deducing these coefficients. The first step involves integrating both sides of our equation and using the concept of orthogonal pairs of trigonometric functions, which essentially denotes that integrals of cosine-n-cosine or sine-n-sine (where n and m are indices) would equal to zero when n is not equal to m, otherwise, it equals T/2. This property is applied throughout the process to arrive at our coefficients 'a₀', 'aₙ', and 'bₙ'.

Finally, once the coefficients are deduced, the values are substituted back into the generic form of a Fourier series. This process confirms the original proposition: that a periodic function can be re-expressed as a sum of cosine and sine functions, or in other words, as a Fourier series.

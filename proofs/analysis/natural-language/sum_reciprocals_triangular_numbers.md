This proof is stating and demonstrating that if you take all natural numbers, and for each one calculate the fraction that is 2 divided by the product of the number and the number plus 1, the total sum of those fractions for all natural numbers equals to 2.

At the beginning, it defines the set of natural numbers, confirming that every natural number plus 1, and the result of any natural number times one more than itself, are also included in that set.

Next, it introduces two separate propositions. The first proposition, or lemma, says that for any natural number, the product of the number and itself plus 1 is not zero. This equates to say that the fraction of 2 divided by the product of any natural number and one more than that natural number is equal to 2 times the reciprocal of the product of that number and one more than itself.

The second proposition asserts that if you take a sequence, where each term or sequence member is 1 divided by the product of its index and one more than that index, then that sequence will converge to a specific value and that value is 1.

The main part of the proof states that for every natural number, the product of the number and one more than itself is a complex number, is not equal to 0, and is a reciprocal of real number. It asserts that when you calculate the sum of a sequence where each term is 1 divided by the product of its index and one more than that index, and then multiply the total sum by 2, you get the same total sum of fractions as proposed in the initial theorem. And this total sum equals to 1.

The proof concludes by asserting that the sum of fractions as proposed in the initial theorem is equal to 2 times the sum of the reciprocals of products of natural numbers and the number right after themselves, and since this last sum is proved to be 1, the total sum of the original array of fractions equals to 2, proving the theorem is true.

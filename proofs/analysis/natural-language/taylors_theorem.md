This proof explains The Taylor's Theorem, which guarantees the existence of a point 'c' in the open interval (a, b) such that the value of f at b (f(b)) can be approximated by a polynomial, the Taylor polynomial, that sums the terms resulted from dividing the kth derivative of f at a (f^(k)(a)) by k factorial (k!) and multiplying by (b - a)^k, for k from 0 to n-1, and adds up a term that includes the nth derivative of f at 'c' (f^(n)(c)) divided by n factorial (n!) and multiplied by (b - a)^n.

This theorem is conditioned on the function f having continuous derivatives up to and including order n on the interval [a, b] and a being less than b.

The proof first mentions an extended version of Rolle's Theorem which states that if a function and its (nâˆ’1) derivatives are equal at the endpoints a and b, and the function is differentiable and continuous in the interval (a, b) then there exists a point 'c' in (a, b) where its nth derivative equals zero.

Next, it provides a method to construct a polynomial (P) of degree n for a given function (f). It mandates that the kth derivative of the polynomial (P) at a must equal the kth derivative of the function (f) at a, for k from 0 to n-1 and the nth derivative of the polynomial at a needs to be zero. Then it specifies how to define coefficients of the polynomial.

Using these two parts, the proof shows that if the difference between the function value at point b and the polynomial value at point b fulfills conditions of the extended Rolle's Theorem, then the Taylor's Theorem holds.

In the continuation, the proof uses the Cauchy Mean Value theorem in a construction of the function G to establish the existence of the point 'c' fulfilling the requirements of the Taylor's Theorem under the conditions stated earlier.

Finally, it concludes the proof, showing that the conditionality of Taylor's theorem can always be satisfied under the given assumptions. That completes the proof for the Taylor's Theorem.

This proof revolves around multiple mathematical concepts: Fourier series, pointwise convergence, function definitions, and the evaluation of function values. 

Firstly, the proof states that a Fourier series of any function 'f' in a set 'F' converges if and only if 'f' either satisfies the Holder condition, is composed of functions of bounded variation, or if its Fourier coefficients are absolutely summable. This is crucial because it defines which types of functions in set 'F' can be expressed as a Fourier series.

Next, it introduces an example function f(x) = x(1 - x) and assumes its Fourier expansion can be represented as 1/6 - the sum of a series involving cosines and squared integers from 1 to infinity. The point here is that any function 'f' that's considered in the set 'F' must align with the mentioned conditions for pointwise convergence in terms of its Fourier series.

Then, the proof considers the values of the function 'f' at x = 0 and x = 1/2. By doing so, it introduces the Riemann zeta function, ζ(2), and reveals a relationship between ζ(2) and the value of 'f' at 0, which turns out to be ζ(2) = π^2 / 6. Similarly, the value of 'f' at 1/2 is characterized by the alternating series and π^2 / 12.

Followingly, it puts forward a subtraction identity related to ζ(2), illustrating that ζ(2) minus π^2 / 12 equals twice the summation over squared even integers, and this result equals half of ζ(2). 

Finally, the proof concludes that the value of the Riemann zeta function at 2, which is ζ(2), equals the sum of the reciprocals of squared integers, and uniquely equates to π^2 / 6.

In essence, this proof is showcasing and linking various mathematical properties of certain functions and series, with the Riemann zeta function playing a central role.

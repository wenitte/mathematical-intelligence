The theorem called Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality states that for any sequence of real numbers a1, a2, ..., an and b1, b2, ..., bn, the sum of their squared quantities times each other is always greater than or equal to the square of their sum multiplied together. Additionally, the only way to achieve balance or equality in this inequality is if every element in each sequence is proportional, meaning each corresponding pair of numbers is just a scale of one another by a factor λ.

Proving this theorem, first we assume two sequences a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ and b₁, b₂, ..., bₙ exist in the set of real numbers. Then, we introduce a sum S which is the sum of the squares of the differences between each element ai and bⱼ multiplied with their counterparts in reverse order. 

On expanding this sum, S reorganizes into two terms. One is twice the product of the sums of ai squared and bⱼ squared, and the second is twice the square of the sum of ai and bⱼ products. Since this is the square of their differences, S must be greater than or equal to 0.

This implies that the product of the sums of squares of each sequence is always greater than or equal to the square of the sums of their products. 

For the equality condition, we suppose the summation S equals 0. This implies that the difference in products of ai / bi and aj / bj for every i, and j in the sequence equals 0, meaning they are the same constant λ. 

This leads us to the conclusion that each element in the sequence is proportional to its counterpart by a factor λ.

The Stirling Approximation, named after James Stirling, is a mathematical theorem that provides an approximation for calculating factorial (!) of large numbers, denoted by n!. This is a key understanding for understanding complex equations, particularly in areas such as statistics. 

The theorem is defined by the relationship, "n!" is approximately equal to "n to the power of n, multiplied by the base of natural logarithms (e) raised to the power of -n all under the square root of n, then multiplied by n itself and furthermore multiplied by square root of 2Ï€". 

This approximation becomes more accurate as the value of n increases. It's important to note that the symbol "~" means "approximately equal to". 

All in all, this theorem is a way to simplify the computation of factorials for large numbers.

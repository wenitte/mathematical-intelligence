This proof is dealing with some advanced concepts in mathematics, particularly in the area of functional analysis and number theory. Let's try to understand it using more informal, natural language.

The first part of the proof is defining what we mean by a "Hilbert space". In our case, H is a Hilbert space if and only if it is set of functions, f, that are square integrable over the interval [0,1], and where the inner product of any two basis vectors, e_m and e_n, equals 1 if m and n are the same and 0 otherwise.

The next part of the proof deals with Parseval's identity, a fundamental result in Fourier analysis. This is saying that for all functions, g, in our Hilbert space, H, the inner product of g with itself is equal to the square of the norm of g, which is also equal to the sum over all n of the magnitudes of the inner product of g and the nth basis vector, squared.

Afterward, we have a part of the proof specifying the relationships in the basis. Here, it's saying that the inner product of a function g with itself is 1/3, and its inner product with the first basis vector is 1/2. For all other basis vectors, the inner product is 1 divided by twice the product of Pi and the index of basis vector.

The next part of the proof is proposing a series expansion for all functions, g, in Hilbert space, H. The statements imply that 1/3 is equal to 1/4 plus the sum, over all non-zero integers, of 1 divided by four times Pi squared times the square of the integer.

Finally, the proof concludes by pointing toward a particular series, related to the Riemann zeta function at 2 (Î¶(2)), which in number theory is known to equal Pi squared divided by 6. This series is the sum of the reciprocals of all natural numbers squared. 

In summary, the proof establishes a Hilbert space and explores its properties and various relationships including valuable theorems like Parseval's, and connects it back to an important result in number theory concerning the Riemann zeta function.

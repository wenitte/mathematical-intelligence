This mathematical proof explains the value of the Riemann Zeta function at 2 (i.e. ζ(2)) in terms of a function and a square contour in the complex plane.

Firstly, the function 'g' can be stated in terms of a series: 'f', and the behavior of function 'g' at its poles, which are integers (denoted as ℤ) where cotangent becomes infinite.

Next, the residues of function 'g' at its poles are set. At zero, it's -π²/3, while for other integer values described as 'n', it's 1/n².

Afterwards, a square contour 'C' in the complex plane (ℂ) is defined as 'C_N', having vertices at (±1 ± i)(N + 1/2), where 'i' is the imaginary unit and 'N' is a natural number.

The fourth step links the formula from previous step to the sum of residues by stating a residue theorem, with 'I_N' being the sum of residues of function 'g' divided by 2πi.

Following this, an identity for the absolute value of a cotangent function is presented, connecting the function to real and imaginary parts of a complex number.

Proceeding further, for points 'z' on vertical edges of 'C_N', the square of the absolute value of the cotangent function remains below 1, hinting its bounded nature along the vertical edges.

Similarly, for the horizontal edges of 'C_N', the square of the absolute value of the cotangent function is less than the square of the value of hyperbolic cotangent at π/2.

Moving ahead, the proof brings into context a new function 'f', stating it to be bounded by (πK) / (N + 1/2)² along 'C_N', where 'K' equals the hyperbolic cotangent of π/2 . Using this, it restricts the absolute value of 'I_N', implying that it is bounded as well.

Finally, the proof asserts the limit of 'I_N' as 'N' tends towards infinity to be zero, concluding it in stating the Riemann Zeta function at 2 is equal to π²/6. 

Hence, through a thoughtful series of logical steps starting from a trigonometric function and ending at the limit of residues, this proof demonstrates the value of ζ(2) to be π²/6.

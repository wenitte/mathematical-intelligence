This is a proof attempting to show that the square root of 2 is irrational, that is, it cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.

To begin, we assume that sqrt(2) can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, p and q, where p and q have no common factors aside from 1 (i.e., they are relatively prime). The integers p and q belong to the set of integers, denoted by â„¤. Moreover, we're assuming that 2 is a rational number for this argument.

If these assumptions hold, then we can make the following conclusions:

There exists an integer m such that p = 2m, meaning that p is an even number. Similarly, there exists an integer n such that q = 2n, which suggests that q is also an even number.

However, this leads to a contradiction. If p and q are both even, then they are not relatively prime, since they share 2 as a common factor. This contradicts our initial assumption that p and q are relatively prime.

Furthermore, it also contradicts the existence of such integers p and q that can express sqrt(2) as a ratio, being in the integer set and being relatively prime.

In light of this contradiction following from our original assumptions, we can conclude that the assumption that 2 is rational does not stand. Therefore, we deduce that sqrt(2) is irrational.

The theorem in question is referred to as the theorem of "div3". This theorem states that for all natural numbers, denoted as 'n' and 'd', an equation holds true. This equation is that the modulus of a number 'n' taken with respect to 3 is equal to the modulus of the sum of its digits, also taken with respect to 3.

Let's break down the definitions provided:

- The term "number(n,d)" refers to a specific calculation, which is the natural number 'n' multiplied by the number 'd' raised to the power of the length of 'n'.
- "Sumdigits(n,d)" refers to the sum of all the digits of our natural number 'n', where the representation of these digits is in the base-d number system. 
- "Digits(n,d)" is used to describe the sequence of base-d digits of 'n'.

In simpler terms, the theorem is stating: in any base-d system, if you have a number, and you take it mod 3, this result is the same as if you were to sum all of its digits (in base-d) and take that sum mod 3. In other words, a number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3, regardless of what base the number is presented in.

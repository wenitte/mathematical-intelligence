This mathematical proof is exploring Liouville's theorem, which is a result about the approximation of real numbers by rational numbers. It's a little complex, so let's start from the beginning.

Initially, it's implying that if a real number x is algebraic (i.e., it is a root of a non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients) and its degree is n, then there exists a positive real number k(x) such that for every natural number n, there are no pairs of integers p and natural number q with co-prime p and q where the absolute difference between x and the ratio p/q is less than the value of k(x) divided by q raised to the power of n+1.

The proof then moves on to define a polynomial function, P, as a function that equals the sum of integer multiples of X raised to the power of n, where f(x) equals to zero and has degree n, f(x) is irreducible over the integers. Being irreducible means that the polynomial can't be factored into two non-trivial polynomial factors. The theorem is proposing that for all pairs of integer p and natural number q with gcd(p, q) equal to 1, the value of the polynomial f at the point p/q is non-zero.

Next, it's saying that for another function, N, the absolute value (i.e., the positive magnitude) of the difference between x and the ratio p/q is always greater than or equal to 1, for all pairs of integer p and natural number q.

Following on, it states that for the error of the above-mentioned fraction F, for every real number c when the absolute value of c minus x is less than 1 and f'(c) is less than a certain positive real value M, the absolute value of f evaluated at p/q must be less than M times the absolute value of x minus p/q, times q to the power of n. 

The argument now heads towards a contradiction, assuming that there exist an infinite number of pairs (p, q) such that the aforementioned absolute difference between x and p/q is less than the ratio k(x)/q to the power of n+1, leading to the existence of some p, q for which the absolute value of x minus p/q times q to the power of n+1 is less than 1/M, which contradicts the earlier statement that the absolute value of f evaluated at p/q is greater than or equal to 1/q to the power n. 

The final statement is the conclusion of the theorem, it concludes that if a real number x is algebraic of degree n, then rational numbers can approximate it up to order n.

So in simpler terms, this theorem is saying that algebraic numbers of a certain degree can be approximated fairly accurately by rational numbers, up to a certain precision defined by the degree of the algebraic number.

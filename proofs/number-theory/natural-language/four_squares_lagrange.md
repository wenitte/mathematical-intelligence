The theorem being presented is Lagrange’s Four-Square Theorem, which states that any natural number can be represented as the sum of four squares of integers.

The proof begins with a lemma (Lemma1, Euler's identity) which states that the product of the sums of two sets of four squares can still be expressed as a sum of four squares, but this time involving combination of the variables from both sets.

The second lemma (Lemma2, Reduction by halving) offers a technique for reducing a number represented by two squared integers to a half of the original number represented by a different set of squared integers.

The third lemma (Lemma3, Odd prime multiple) shows there is a way of expressing odd prime numbers as the sum of two squares and one, with each term being less than the prime, showing that each odd prime can be represented in terms of lower integer squares and multiples.

The proof then lays out a base case where the number 2 is shown to be representable as a sum of four squares — specifically, 1² + 1² + 0² + 0².

Then, a general case is provided for odd prime numbers, saying that for any prime number 'p', there exists another number 'm' such that 'm*p' is the sum of four squares (also using Lemma3).

A reduction step is then offered, which builds on the principles in Lemma1 and Lemma2, allowing us to lower the value of 'm' by showing that for some smaller 'n', 'n*p' can still be expressed as a sum of four squares.

This step keeps being applied repeatedly (Iterative reduction) until 'm' gets down to 1, at which point, 'p' itself is being expressed as a sum of four squares.

In the generalization step, we extend this idea to any natural number 'n', asserting that if 'n' is a product of prime numbers, each of which can be expressed as a sum of four squares, then 'n' itself can be expressed as a sum of four squares using Euler's identity (Lemma1). 

In conclusion, the result shows that any natural number 'n' can indeed be expressed as the sum of four squares of integers, mathematically notated as ∀n ∈ ℕ, ∃a, b, c, d ∈ ℤ : n = a² + b² + c² + d². Therefore, the theorem is proven.

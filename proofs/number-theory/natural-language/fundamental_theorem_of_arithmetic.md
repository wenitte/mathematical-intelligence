In more understandable language, the theorem that is being proved here is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. It claims that every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed uniquely as a product of prime numbers.

First, we have two lemmas, which are smaller pieces of logic that support the main proof. The first one, called the gcd_property, says that if a number m divides the product of two other numbers, p and q, and if m shares no factors other than 1 with p, then m must also divide q. The second lemma, referred to as Euclid’s lemma, says that if a prime number p divides the product of several numbers, then p must divide at least one of those numbers. 

The existence proof proves that the theorem holds true for all possible values. It uses an induction method, a common technique in math proofs where you first prove a base case (the simplest possible case, in this case when n equals 2), and then show that if the theorem is true for some value k, it must also be true for the value k+1. Here, the induction step says that if n is a composite number (a number that can be formed by multiplying two smaller numbers, a and b), and we know that smaller values all can be expressed as a product of primes (from the induction assumption), then n also can be expressed as a product of primes.

The uniqueness proof ensures that there is only one way to express each number as a product of primes. It assumes that there are two different ways to express the same number, and then uses the prime_analytics section and Euclid’s lemma to sequentially show that each prime on the left-hand side must appear on the right-hand side, and vice-versa. Ultimately, this process finds that the initial assumption (that there are two different prime factorizations) is not possible, proving uniqueness.

Finally, the lcm_application part says that the least common multiple of two numbers a and b (the smallest number that both a and b divide) can be found by taking the product of all the distinct primes found in their prime factorizations.

In conclusion, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of primes, is proven.

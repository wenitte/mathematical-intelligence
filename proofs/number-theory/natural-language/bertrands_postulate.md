The Bertrand Postulate, also known as Bertrand's theorem, states that for any integer greater than 1, there exists at least one prime number between that integer and its double. 

The proof of Bertrand's Postulate goes as follows: 

We start by assuming we have a natural number, 'n', which is greater than 1. From that, we can define a set, 'S', containing all prime numbers, 'p', that lie strictly between n and 2n. 

If Bertrand's Postulate was false, then no prime number would exist in this range, meaning for all prime numbers, p, they would either be less than or equal to n, or greater than 2n.

Next, we define the binomial coefficient C of (2n, n) as the factorial of 2n divided by the square of the factorial of n. 

It turns out that this binomial coefficient is always greater than the ratio of 4 to the power of n, over (2n + 1). 

Now let's think about any prime number, p. If we define vₚ(k!) as the sum of the largest power of p that divides k, over all k. 

The value of vₚ for the binomial coefficient C of (2n, n) would be equal to the difference between vₚ of the factorial of 2n and twice the vₚ of the factorial of n. 

Now, for any prime number that lies strictly between n and 2n, the vₚ for the binomial coefficient C of (2n, n) is at least 1. 

If no prime number belongs to the set S, it would mean that the binomial coefficient is less than or equal to 2 to the power of n. But this contradicts with our earlier finding that the binomial coefficient C of (2n, n) is greater than the ratio of 4 to the power of n, over (2n + 1). 

So, there must at least one prime number in S, between n and 2n, verifying the Bertrand's Postulate.

The given proof is a demonstration of the infinity of prime numbers, or the statement that there are infinitely many prime numbers. The proof is organized in a series of logical implications, moving from definitions to a final contradiction.

We start by establishing the definitions of a prime number, p, and a composite number, n. A prime number is greater than 1 and divisible by only 1 and itself. A composite number, on the other hand, is greater than 1 and divisible by a number that is not itself or 1.

We further note that if a number is prime, it divides into either m or n if it divides into their product m*n. We also state that if a number is composite, then it's not a prime number.

Next, we establish that every integer greater than 1 has a prime number divisor.

We then suppose that the set of all prime numbers is finite and define this set as P. We also define the maximum prime number in this set as max_prime.

We construct a number, N, which is the product of all primes in P, plus one.

Now we start our steps of the proof. 

Step 1: We claim that N is greater than max_prime, since it includes the product of all primes (which includes max_prime) plus one.

Step 2: From our previous statement that every integer greater than 1 has a prime divisor, we know that N (since it is greater than 1) has a prime divisor, say q. 

Step 3: We address the case when q is in P, but we quickly run into a contradiction. If q is in P, then it divides the product of all numbers in P, but since we added one to this product to get N, q can't divide N. We have a paradox, meaning q cannot be in the set P. 

Step 4: So, if q is not in the set P then it must be a new prime. This contradicts our assumption of max_prime as the maximum prime because q is greater than max_prime. 

Since steps 3 and 4 both lead to contradictions, our initial assumption that P, the set of all prime numbers is finite, must be false. Hence, we conclude that the set of prime numbers is infinite.

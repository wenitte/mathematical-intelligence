Sure. Let's unpack this proof step by step.

The first component of the proof establishes a general rule for all sets X, given that a set X is countable, or denumerable, if and only if there exists a bijective function from the set of positive integers (ℤ⁺) to X. This bijective function forms a one-to-one correspondence between each element in the two sets, effectively showing that both sets have the same number of elements.

Then, we make an assumption that the set of rational numbers (ℚ), is not countable. 

Next, we define a function from the set of rational numbers to the Cartesian product of the set of integers and the set of positive integers (ℤ x ℤ⁺). For each rational number q in ℚ, this function produces a pair (m, n) such that q equals to m divided by n, n is greater than 0, and the greatest common divisor of m and n is 1. This function essentially represents each rational number as a unique pair of integers with a certain property.

Then, it asserts that if two rational numbers get mapped to the same pair through this function, then those two rational numbers are identical. This confirms the function is well-defined and injective, or one-to-one.

The image of the function, denoted as ℚ under function f, is then shown to be a subset of the set ℤ × ℤ⁺, which is not only infinite but also countable. This means we have an infinite subset of a countable set, which implies this subset also should be countable. So, if ℤ × ℤ⁺ is countable, then the image of rational numbers under function f, which is a subset of ℤ × ℤ⁺, should also be countable.

Next, it is stated that if the function f creates a bijection with its image, then the set of rational numbers must be countable, contradicting the initial assumption that ℚ is not denumerable. 

Finally, the contradiction negates the original assumption (thereby asserting that the set of rational numbers is, in fact, countable), completing the proof, and hence claims that the set of rational numbers, ℚ, is countable or denumerable.

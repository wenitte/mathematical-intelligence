The following proof is about the properties of the Legendre symbol and how it works with two odd prime numbers.

Let's consider two distinct prime numbers 'p' and 'q'. Note that these numbers are odd and belong to the set of all prime numbers, denoted by â„™.

The Legendre symbol, noted as LegendreSymbol(p, q), has three possible values:

1 - If there exists a number 'x' such that 'x' squared is congruent to 'p' modulo 'q'. This means that when 'x' squared is divided by 'q', it leaves a remainder of 'p'.

-1 - If such 'x' does not exist and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 'p' and 'q' equals one.

0 - If 'q' divides 'p' evenly.

Next, consider that 'a' to the power of ((p-1)/2) is congruent to the Legendre symbol of 'a' and 'p' modulo 'p'.

Now, the central point of the proof: The Legendre symbol of 'p' and 'q' is equal to the product of the Legendre symbol 'q' and 'p' and (-1) to the power of ((p-1)(q-1)/4). This formula signifies reciprocity between number 'p' and 'q' in the Legendre symbol.

In simple terms, this formula connects the Legendre symbol values for two different prime numbers, implying that they share a certain reciprocal relationship mediated by a factor depending on their values.

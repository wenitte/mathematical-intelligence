The theorem in question is known as Fermat's theorem on the sum of two squares. 

It states that for all natural numbers 'p', if 'p' is a prime number then there exist integers 'a' and 'b' such that 'p' can be expressed as the sum of squares of 'a' and 'b' if, and only if, 'p' is equal to 2 or 'p' leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.

The direction of the proof starts by assuming 'p' can be expressed as the sum of squares of 'a' and 'b'. As squares of numbers leave a remainder of 0 or 1 when divided by 4, the sum of two squares will leave a remainder of 0, 1, or 2 when divided by 4. But since 'p' is assumed to be prime and not divisible by 4, the only way for 'p' to have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 is if 'p' is indeed 2. So, 'p' is either 2 or leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.

The proof then introduces two lemmas. Lemma 1 asserts that if a prime number 'p' leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, it divides a number 'N', which can be expressed as the sum of squares of two coprime numbers. Lemma 2 extends this by stating if 'p' divides the sum of squares of two coprime numbers, then 'p' itself can be expressed as the sum of squares of two coprime numbers.

Both lemmas are then proved, using contradiction-based proofs to show how the desired results only occur when 'p' equals 2 or leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.

Finally, it is shown that if a prime number 'p' leaving a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares, an infinite decreasing sequence of prime numbers would be formed - a clear contradiction since the smallest prime number is 2 and it can be expressed as a sum of two squares.

Consequently, it is concluded that a prime number 'p' is equivalent to 2 or leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 if, and only if, 'p' can be expressed as a sum of squares of two integers. Hence, this theorem is established.

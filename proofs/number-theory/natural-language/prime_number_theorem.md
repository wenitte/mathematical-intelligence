This involves explaining the distribution of prime numbers within natural numbers. 

To start with, an universal quantifier '∀x' states that a particular expression is true for all possible values of the variable 'x'.

The expression π(x) ∼ x / log(x) indicates an approximation function. It's relating the prime counting function π(x) - which counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to 'x' - to the number 'x' divided by its natural logarithm.

The function ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function, defined as the sum of the reciprocal of all natural numbers raised to the power 's', for Re(s) greater than 1. 

This Riemann zeta function can also be represented as the product over all primes 'p' of (1 - 1/p^s)^-1. 

We know that the zeta function doesn't equal 0 for any real part of 's' greater than 1. 

There's another function ψ(x), which is equal to the sum of the logarithm of all primes less than or equal to 'x'. 

The significantly complex mathematical function ψ(s), is defined as minus the derivative of the zeta function divided by the zeta function itself. This ψ(s) function is declared as meromorphic for the real part of 's' greater than half, implying that it can be expressed as the ratio of two holomorphic functions. We also know that the zeta function has no zeros when the real part of 's' equals 1.

Moreover, the integral of (ψ(x) - x)/x^2 dx from 1 to infinity converges, indicating that the area under the mathematical function above is finite.

Importantly, as x becomes exceedingly large, the approximation ψ(x) ∼ x indicates that the function ψ(x) can essentially be simplified to 'x'.

There's also an equation that says that π(x)log(x) equals ψ(x) - this equates the prime counting function times the natural logarithm of 'x' to the function ψ(x).

Finally, we return to our primary claim: starting from ψ(x) ∼ x, we have π(x)log(x) ∼ x, and then π(x) ∼ x / log(x). If ψ(x) can be simplified to 'x', and ψ(x) equals π(x)log(x), then it follows that π(x)log(x) can also be simplified to 'x'. Dividing this simplification by log(x) gives the result that the prime counting function π(x) is essentially equal to 'x' divided by its natural logarithm. This elegantly describes the distribution of prime numbers less than or equal to any given natural number 'x'.

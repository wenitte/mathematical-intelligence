The theorem statement describes a characteristic of perfect numbers. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its factors, excluding itself. So, the theorem says that for any natural number 'k' greater than 1, if '2 raised to the power of k minus 1' is a prime number - then we can define 'n' as '2 raised to the power of k minus 1 times 2 raised to the power of k minus 1.' Then, 'n' is a perfect number. Moreover, any 'n' in the set of even perfect numbers will be equal to this expression.

In the proof, an assumption is made that 'k' is a natural number greater than 1 and 'p' is a prime number given by '2 raised to the power of k minus 1.' 'n' is then defined as '2 raised to the power of k minus 1 times p.' It is shown that the sum of divisors of 'n,' denoted by the sigma of 'n,' is equal to '2n,' which makes 'n' a perfect number.

In the next part, we start by assuming that 'n' belongs to the set of even perfect numbers and can be represented as the product of '2 raised to the power of k minus 1' and 'm,' which is an odd number and 'k' is more than 2. Then we use the rules of divisor sums and substitution and find that 'm' is equal to '2 raised to the power of k minus 1.' Eventually, we show that 'n' is equal to '2 raised to the power of k minus 1 times 2 raised to the power of k minus 1,' the same number we initialized. Thus, our assumptions about perfect numbers are proved.

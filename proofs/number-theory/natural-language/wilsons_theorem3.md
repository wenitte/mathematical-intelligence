The statement being proved here is Wilson's theorem, which highlights the property of prime numbers. It essentially states that for any prime number 'p', the factorial of (p-1) when divided by 'p' gives a remainder of -1.

The first major step of this proof involves identifying a primitive root 'g' modulo 'p'. Primitive roots are numbers that generate all non-zero residues under modulo 'p' operations. In simpler words, if you keep raising 'g' to higher powers and take a modulo 'p' after every step, all possible numbers from 1 to (p-1) will eventually appear.

Once 'g' is identified, we can equate (p-1)! with the product of terms in the sequence generated by 'g', as we will encompass all integers from 1 to (p-1). This means that (p-1)! is equivalent to raising g to the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to (p-2), i.e., (p-2)(p-1)/2, under modulo 'p'.

Now, we look at the representation of an odd prime number 'p'. It can be expressed in the form '2k+1' where 'k' is any natural number. Through Fermat's Little theorem, we already know that g^(p-1) is 1 under modulo 'p'. From this, we deduce that g^k is either equivalent to 1 or -1 under modulo 'p'. However, we iterate that g^k can't be equivalent to 1 (from our assumptions), hence g^k must be equivalent to -1 modulo 'p'.

In the final step, we substitute this value of g^k back into our equivalence for (p-1)!, and find that it ultimately comes down to being equal to -1 raised to the power of (2k-1), for all 'k', which yields -1 as the result.

So we finally have that for all primes 'p', (p-1)! is, indeed, congruent to -1 modulo 'p', completing the proof of Wilson's theorem.

Let's introduce and explain the proof in natural language. 

1) We begin by examining the Wirtinger's inequality definition of function f. Here, f is a function that maps from the interval [0, 2π] to real numbers. The function is piecewise smooth and is 2π periodic; meaning it takes on the same values at every 2π interval. The integral (∫₀²ᵖ f(t)dt) of this function over the interval 0 to 2π is equal to zero.

2) The inequality based on Wirtinger's considers the square of the derivative of the function over the [0, 2π] interval. It says that ∫₀²ᵖ (f')²dt is greater or equal to ∫₀²ᵖ f²dt. In the special case of equality, the function f(t) can be represented as a combination of sine and cosine functions, acos(t) + bsin(t).

3) The parameterization of a curve γ(t) is defined by a function pair (x(t), y(t)). The magnitude of the derivative of this curve is equal to the length l, scaled by a factor of 1/2π. The integral of x(t) over the interval [0, 2π] is equal to zero.

4) The area of the enclosed region can be represented via double integral as ∬_int(γ) dxdy, which is also equivalent to ∫₀²ᵖ xy'dt. The square of the curve's length (scaled by the factor 1/2π) is equal to the integral of the sum of squares of x' and y' over the interval [0, 2π].

5) The isoperimetric relation (which in plain terms means a measure of how a shape is constrained given a certain perimeter and area) states that l² - 4πA (the difference between the scaled length and four times the π times area) can be expressed as the sum of two integrals, in which each integral has the square of the derived function minus the square of the function. Importantly, this quantity is greater than or equal to zero.

6) Finally, the evaluation concludes that l² is greater or equal to 4πA (representing a relation between the length and area). If this is a relation of equality, then our curve γ represents a circle with a radius equal to l/2π. 

In essence, this proof outlines the Wirtinger's inequality and applies it to a 2D curve, calculated area with integrals, evaluated the isoperimetric relation and in the end, related all the conditions to the properties of the circle.

This proof is demonstrating the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem. This theorem states that for any continuous function that maps a disk onto itself, there is always at least one point, called a "fixed point", that will match the same location in both the original and transformed disk.

The assumption predicting a contradiction proposes that there exists a continuous function, making no such fixed point present, which conflicts with the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem.

Next, we construct an extension, labeled "H", that shoots a ray from any point in the disk to the corresponding point in the output. If the theory were correct, this would create a mapping from the original disk to the boundary of the disk.

We then introduce an induced map, coming from this construction of H and the original inclusion function i. This map is a group homomorphism, a structure-preserving map, which when combined with the inclusion function creates another function that acts very much like the identity function on the boundary of the circle.

By the properties of the fundamental group, we then derive that the resulting function after all these transformations is an integer-to-integer (ℤ → ℤ) mapping. Additionally, the application of π₁ - which is a measure of loop movement in topological space - on the extended function (h) and the original inclusion function (i) results in zero, meaning our network of transformations basically does nothing.

Nevertheless, when these no-change results are combined in the same way as the identity function on the circle, we get a contradiction. The identity function on the integers cannot map all integers to zero, which our earlier assumptions would necessitate.

Therefore, the initial contradiction hypothesis, predicting the possibility of a continuous function without having a fixed point, must be false. This confirms the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem.

This is a theorem named after the French mathematician Girard Desargues. It's a condition about the relationship between points and lines in a plane. 

Here's what the theorem says in simple language:

Suppose we have seven different points that we'll name A, A₁, B, B₁, C, C₁, and S. These points are all located in a plane, we’ll call it 'PO'. Now, these points are such that no three of them are the same; there are no duplicates. Additionally, they are arranged such that points A, A₁, and B form one triangle, and points A, A₁, and C form another triangle.

We also notice something interesting: the points A and A₁ align with point S, as do the points B and B₁, and the points C and C₁. So, basically, if we drew straight lines through each pair of points, each line would pass through the point S. 

Let's now make an observation about the lines we get if we connect certain pairs of points. If we connect points A and B, and also A₁ and B₁, we get two lines that run alongside each other without intersecting - they’re parallel. Similarly, if we connect points A and C, as well as A₁ and C₁, we again get two lines that are parallel to each other.

Now, here’s the main claim or conclusion of this theorem: Given all of these above conditions, if you then connect points B and C and also B₁ and C₁, you will get another pair of lines that are also parallel to each other. 

In other words, under these specific conditions, if two sets of lines formed by joining certain points are parallel to each other, then a third set of lines will also be parallel. 

It's a highly specific situation, but this is what the Desargues theorem asserts.

I'll convert this proof to FL-Math notation, making logical steps and connections explicit:

```
theorem Recurring_Nines_Equals_One() {
  assert(
    0.999... = 1
  )
} ↔

proof Recurring_Nines_Equals_One() {
  // Initial equality statement
  assert(9/9 = 1) →

  lemma Long_Division_Process() {
    setVar(dividend: 9.000...) ∧
    setVar(divisor: 9) →
    assert(
      longDivision(9.000..., 9) = {
        quotient: 0.999...,
        steps: [
          {value: 9, remainder: 0},
          {value: 90, remainder: 9},
          {value: 90, remainder: 9},
          {value: 90, remainder: 9},
          // Continuing pattern
        ]
      }
    )
  } →

  apply(Long_Division_Process()) →
  
  // Chain of equalities
  assert(
    0.999... = 9/9 ∧
    9/9 = 1
  ) →
  
  // Transitivity of equality
  conclude(
    0.999... = 1
  )
}
```

Notes on the conversion:
1. Created explicit theorem and proof blocks
2. Made the long division process into a formal lemma
3. Used logical connectives (→, ∧) to show progression
4. Maintained mathematical notation while formalizing steps
5. Added structured representation of long division algorithm
6. Made equality chain explicit with proper logical connections
7. Used conclude() for final statement
8. Incorporated all essential mathematical content from original proof

The FL-Math notation makes explicit the logical structure that was implicit in the natural language proof, while preserving the mathematical rigor of the original argument.

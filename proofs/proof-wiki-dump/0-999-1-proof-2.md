I'll convert this proof into FL-Math notation, making the logical steps and connections explicit.

```
theorem ZeroPointNineRepeatingEqualsOne() {
  assert(
    0.999... = 1
  )
} ↔

proof ZeroPointNineRepeatingEqualsOne() {
  // First establish that 0.333... = 1/3
  lemma OneThirdDecimal() {
    assert(0.333... = 1/3)
  } →

  // Apply multiplication by 3 to both sides
  apply(MultiplicationProperty(3)) {
    assert(
      (3 × 0.333...) = (3 × 1/3)
    )
  } →

  // Simplify left side using decimal multiplication
  lemma DecimalMultiplication() {
    assert(
      3 × 0.333... = 0.999...
    )
  } →

  // Simplify right side using fraction arithmetic
  lemma FractionSimplification() {
    assert(
      3 × (1/3) = 3/3
    )
  } →

  // Connect steps through transitivity
  assert(
    0.999... = 3 × 0.333... ∧
    3 × 0.333... = 3 × (1/3) ∧
    3 × (1/3) = 3/3 ∧
    3/3 = 1
  ) →

  // Final conclusion through transitivity
  conclude(
    0.999... = 1
  )
}
```

Notes on the conversion:
1. I've structured the proof as a main theorem and several lemmas
2. Each step is explicitly connected using the → operator
3. The logical flow is made clear through assertions and applications
4. The multiplication property is referenced explicitly
5. Transitivity of equality is used to connect the chain of equalities
6. The conclusion follows from the connected chain of equalities
7. Each major step (decimal equality, multiplication, simplification) is separated into its own lemma

This FL-Math version makes explicit the logical structure that was implicit in the original proof, while maintaining the mathematical rigor of the argument.

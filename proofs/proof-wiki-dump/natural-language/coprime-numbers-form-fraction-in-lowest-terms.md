Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

Numbers prime to one another are the least of those which have the same ratio with them.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VII}$: Proposition $21$)


Proof
Let $A, B$ be (natural) numbers which are prime to one another.
We need to show that $A$ and $B$ are the least of those which have the same ratio with them.


Suppose this were not the case.
Then there would be some numbers $C, D$ which are less than $A, B$ such that $A : B =  C : D$.
From Proposition $20$ of Book $\text{VII} $: Ratios of Fractions in Lowest Terms we have that $C$ measures $A$ the same number of times that $D$ measures $B$.
Now, as many times as $C$ measures $A$, let there be so many units in $E$.
Then from Proposition $20$ of Book $\text{VII} $: Natural Number Multiplication is Commutative $E$ also measures $A$ according to the units in $C$.
For the same reason $E$ also measures $B$ according to the units in $D$.
Therefore $E$ measures $A$ and $B$, which are prime to one another, which is contrary to our initial hypothesis.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $21$ of Book $\text{VII}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $22$: Numbers forming Fraction in Lowest Terms are Coprime.

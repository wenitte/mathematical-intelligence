Theorem
Let Kuratowski's Lemma be accepted as true.
Then Tukey's Lemma holds.


Proof
Recall Kuratowski's Lemma:
Let $S$ be a  set of sets which is closed under chain unions.
Then every element of $S$ is a subset of a maximal element of $S$ under the subset relation.
$\Box$

Recall Tukey's Lemma:
Let $S$ be a non-empty set of finite character.
Then every element of $S$ is a subset of a maximal element of $S$ under the subset relation.
$\Box$

So, let us assume Kuratowski's Lemma.
Let $S$ be a non-empty set of finite character.
From Class of Finite Character is Closed under Chain Unions, $S$ is closed under chain unions.
Then by Kuratowski's Lemma:

every element of $S$ is a subset of a maximal element of $S$ under the subset relation.
Thus it is seen that Tukey's Lemma likewise holds.
$\blacksquare$

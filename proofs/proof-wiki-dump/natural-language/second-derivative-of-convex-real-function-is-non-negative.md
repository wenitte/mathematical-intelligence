Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function which is twice differentiable on the open interval $\openint a b$.

Then $f$ is convex on $\openint a b$ if and only if its second derivative $f \ge 0$ on $\openint a b$.


Proof
From Real Function is Convex iff Derivative is Increasing, $f$ is convex if and only if $f'$ is increasing.
From Derivative of Monotone Function, $f'$ is increasing if and only if its second derivative $f \ge 0$.
$\blacksquare$

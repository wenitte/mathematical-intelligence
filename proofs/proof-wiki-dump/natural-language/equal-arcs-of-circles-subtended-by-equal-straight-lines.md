Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

In equal circles equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines.
(The Elements: Book $\text{III}$: Proposition $29$)


Proof
Let $ABC$ and $DEF$ be equal circles.
Let equal arcs $BGC$ and $EHF$ be cut off by the straight lines $BC$ and $EF$.


Let $K$ and $L$ be the centers of the circles $ABC$ and $DEF$ respectively.
Let $BK, KC, EL, LF$ be joined.
We have that the arcs $BGC$ and $EHF$ are equal.
So from Angles on Equal Arcs are Equal $\angle BKC = \angle ELF$.
Since circles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are equal, so are their radii.
So $BK = EL$ and $KC = LF$, and they contain equal angles.
So from Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence base $BC$ is equal to base $EF$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $29$ of Book $\text{III}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $28$: Straight Lines Cut Off Equal Arcs in Equal Circles.

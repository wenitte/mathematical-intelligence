Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a non-abelian group.
Then the order of $\struct {G, \circ}$ is greater than $4$.


Proof
It follows from Trivial Group is Cyclic Group and Prime Group is Cyclic that groups of order less than $4$ are cyclic.
Therefore, by Cyclic Group is Abelian, all groups of order less than $4$ are abelian.

Let $G$ have order $4$.
From Order of Element Divides Order of Finite Group, every element of $G$ has order that divides $4$.
Therefore any element of $G$ has order $1$, $2$ or $4$.

Let $g \in G$ have order $4$.
Then $G$ is generated by $g$.
Therefore $G$ is cyclic, and therefore abelian by Cyclic Group is Abelian.

Let $G$ be such that it has no element of order $4$.
From Identity is Only Group Element of Order 1, all the elements apart from its identity must have order $2$.
That is, $G$ is a Boolean group.
By Boolean Group is Abelian, $G$ is abelian.
The result follows.

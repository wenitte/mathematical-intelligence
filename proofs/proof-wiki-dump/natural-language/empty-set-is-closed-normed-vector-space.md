Theorem
Let $M = \struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a normed vector space.

Then the empty set $\O$ is closed in $M$.


Proof
From Normed Vector Space is Open in Itself, $X$ is open in $M$.
But:

$\O = \relcomp X X$
where $\complement_X$ denotes the set complement relative to $X$.
The result follows by definition of closed set.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \preceq, \tau}$ be a linearly ordered space.
Then $T$ is a completely normal space.


Proof
By Linearly Ordered Space is $T_1$, $T$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.
By Linearly Ordered Space is $T_5$, $T$ is a $T_5$ space.
Hence the result, by definition of completely normal space.
$\blacksquare$

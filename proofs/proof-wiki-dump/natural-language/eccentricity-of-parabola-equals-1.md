Theorem
The parabola has eccentricity equal to $1$.


Proof
Let $K$ be a conic section.
From the focus-directrix property of a conic section, $K$ is the locus of points $b$ such that the distance $p$ from $b$ to $D$ and the distance $q$ from $b$ to $F$ are related by the condition:

$(1): \quad q = \epsilon p$
where $\epsilon$ denotes the eccentricity.

Now let $K$ be a parabola.
From the focus-directrix property of the parabola, $K$ is the locus of points $P$ such that the distance $p$ from $P$ to $D$ equals the distance $q$ from $P$ to $F$:

$p = q$
This is an instance of $(1)$ where $\epsilon = 1$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Corollary to Polynomial Factor Theorem
Let $\map P z$ be a polynomial in $z$ over the complex numbers $\C$ of degree $n$.
Suppose there exists $\zeta \in \C: \map P \zeta = 0$.

Then:

$\map P z = \paren {x - \zeta} \map Q z$
where $\map Q z$ is a polynomial of degree $n - 1$.

Hence, if $\zeta_1, \zeta_2, \ldots, \zeta_n \in \C$ such that all are different, and $\map P {\zeta_1} = \map P {\zeta_2} = \dotsb = \map P {\zeta_n} = 0$, then:

$\ds \map P z = k \prod_{j \mathop = 1}^n \paren {z - \zeta_j}$
where $k \in \C$.


Proof
Recall that Complex Numbers form Field.
The result then follows from the Polynomial Factor Theorem.

Also known as
Some sources refer to the Polynomial Factor Theorem (and its variants) as the Factor Theorem, but there are multiple theorems with this name.

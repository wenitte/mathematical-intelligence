Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function which is twice differentiable on the open interval $\openint a b$ such that: 

$\map {f} x > 0$ for each $x \in \openint a b$.

Then $f$ is strictly convex on $\openint a b$.


Proof
From Real Function is Strictly Convex iff Derivative is Strictly Increasing, $f$ is strictly convex if and only if $f'$ is strictly increasing.
Since $f > 0$, we have that $f'$ is strictly increasing from Real Function with Strictly Positive Derivative is Strictly Increasing.
$\blacksquare$

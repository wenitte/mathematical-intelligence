Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.

Then $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ is not countably compact.


Proof
Let $\CC$ be the set of subsets of $\R$ defined as:

$\CC = \set {\openint n {n + 2}: n \in \Z}$
Then $\CC$ is an open cover of $\R$ which is countable.
However, there is no finite subcover for $\R$ of $\CC$.
Hence the result, by definition of countably compact.
$\blacksquare$

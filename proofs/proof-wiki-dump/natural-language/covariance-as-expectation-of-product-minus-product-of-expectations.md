Theorem
Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables. 
Let the expectations of $X$ and $Y$ exist and be finite. 
Then the covariance of $X$ and $Y$ is given by: 

$\cov {X, Y} = \expect {X Y} - \expect X \expect Y$


Proof













\(\ds \cov {X, Y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \expect {\paren {X - \expect X} \paren {Y - \expect Y} }\)





Definition of Covariance














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \expect {X Y - X \expect Y - Y \expect X + \expect X \expect Y}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \expect {X Y} - \expect Y \expect X - \expect Y \expect X + \expect X \expect Y\)





Expectation is Linear, Expectation of Constant














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \expect {X Y} - \expect X \expect Y\)

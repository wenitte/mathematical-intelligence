Theorem
Let $\C_{\ne 0}$ be the set of complex numbers without zero, that is:

$\C_{\ne 0} = \C \setminus \set 0$
The structure $\struct {\C_{\ne 0}, \times}$ is a group.


Proof
Taking the group axioms in turn:


Group Axiom $\text G 0$: Closure
Non-Zero Complex Numbers are Closed under Multiplication.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 1$: Associativity
Complex Multiplication is Associative.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 2$: Existence of Identity Element
From Complex Multiplication Identity is One, the identity element of $\struct {\C_{\ne 0}, \times}$ is the complex number $1 + 0 i$.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 3$: Existence of Inverse Element
From Inverse for Complex Multiplication‎, the inverse of $x + i y \in \struct {\C_{\ne 0}, \times}$ is:

$\dfrac 1 z = \dfrac {x - i y} {x^2 + y^2} = \dfrac {\overline z} {z \overline z}$
where $\overline z$ is the complex conjugate of $z$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The diagonal relation $\Delta_S$ on a set $S$ is universally congruent on $S$.


Proof
We have that the diagonal relation is an equivalence relation.

Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be any algebraic structure.














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds x_1 \mathrel {\Delta_S} x_2 \land y_1 \mathrel {\Delta_S} y_2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds x_1 = x_2 \land y_1 = y_2\)





Definition of Diagonal Relation














\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds x_1 \circ y_1 = x_2 \circ y_2\)





as a consequence of equality














\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds \paren {x_1 \circ y_1} \mathrel {\Delta_S} \paren {x_2 \circ y_2}\)





Definition of Diagonal Relation



$\Delta_S$ can therefore be described as universally congruent.

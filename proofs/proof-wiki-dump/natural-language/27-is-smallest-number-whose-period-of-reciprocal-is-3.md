Theorem
$27$ is the smallest positive integer the decimal expansion of whose reciprocal has a period of $3$:

$\dfrac 1 {27} = 0 \cdotp \dot 03 \dot 7$


Proof
From Reciprocal of $27$:

$\dfrac 1 {27} = 0 \cdotp \dot 03 \dot 7$

It can be determined by inspection of all smaller integers that this is indeed the smallest to have a period of $3$.
$\blacksquare$

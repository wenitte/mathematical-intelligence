Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a discrete topological space.
Then:

$T$ is separable if and only if $S$ is countable.


Proof
Sufficient Condition
Immediate from Separable Discrete Space is Countable.
$\Box$


Necessary Condition
Immediate from Countable Space is Separable.
$\blacksquare$

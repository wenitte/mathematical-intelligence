Example of Equivalence Relation
Let $\Z$ denote the set of integers.
Let $\RR$ denote the relation on $\Z$ defined as:

$\forall x, y \in \Z: x \mathrel \RR y \iff \sin \dfrac {\pi x} 6 = \sin \dfrac {\pi y} 6$
Then $\RR$ is an equivalence relation.


Proof
We have that $\RR \subseteq \R \times \R$ is the relation induced by $\sin \dfrac {x \pi} 6$:

$\tuple {x, y} \in \RR \iff \sin \dfrac {x \pi} 6 = \sin \dfrac {y \pi} 6$
The result follows from Relation Induced by Mapping is Equivalence Relation.

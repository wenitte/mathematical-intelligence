Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

Commensurable magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $5$)


Proof
Let $A$ and $B$ be commensurable magnitudes.
By definition of commensurable, some magnitude will measure them both.
Let $C$ be a common measure of $A$ and $B$.
Let $D$ be the number of times $C$ is the measure of $A$.
Let $E$ be the number of times $C$ is the measure of $B$.

Since:

$C$ measures $A$ according to the number of units of $D$
and

the unit measures $D$ according to the number of units of $D$
it follows that the unit measures $D$ the same number of times
$C$ measures $A$.
From Ratios of Fractions in Lowest Terms:

$\dfrac C A = \dfrac 1 D$
and:

$\dfrac A C = \dfrac D 1 = D$

Similarly, since:

$C$ measures $B$ according to the number of units of $E$
and

the unit measures $E$ according to the number of units of $E$
it follows that the unit measures $E$ the same number of times
$C$ measures $B$.
From Ratios of Fractions in Lowest Terms:

$\dfrac C B = \dfrac 1 E$

So by Equality of Ratios Ex Aequali:

$\dfrac A B = \dfrac D E$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $5$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

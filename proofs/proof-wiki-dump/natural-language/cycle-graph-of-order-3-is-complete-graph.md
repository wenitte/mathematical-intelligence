Theorem
Let $C_3$ denote the cycle graph of order $2$.
Then $C_3$ is the complete graph of of order $3$.


Proof
Let the vertex set of $C_3$ is $\set {v_1, v_2, v_3}$.
By definition of cycle graph, $C_3$ consists of the cycle $v_1 v_2 v_3 v_1$.
It is seen by inspection that:

$v_1$ is adjacent to $v_2$ and $v_3$
$v_2$ is adjacent to $v_1$ and $v_3$
$v_3$ is adjacent to $v_1$ and $v_2$.
Hence the result by definition of complete graph.

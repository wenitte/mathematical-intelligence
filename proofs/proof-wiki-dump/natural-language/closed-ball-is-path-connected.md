Theorem
Let $V$ be a normed vector space with norm $\norm {\,\cdot\,}$ over $\R$ or $\C$.

A closed ball in the metric induced by $\norm {\,\cdot\,}$ is path-connected.


Proof
Follows from:

Closed Ball is Convex Set
Normed Vector Space is Hausdorff Topological Vector Space
Convex Set is Path-Connected
$\blacksquare$

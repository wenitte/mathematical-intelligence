Theorem
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers for some prime $p$.
Let $m \in \N$ such that $p \nmid m$.

Then:

there exists an $m$-th primitive root of unity in $\Q_p$
if and only if:

$m \divides \paren{p-1}$

In which case, an $m$-th root of unity in $\Q_p$ is a $\paren{p-1}$-th root of unity in $\Q_p$

Proof
Necessary Condition
$\Box$

Sufficient Condition
Let $m \divides \paren{p-1}$.
By definition of divisor:

$\exists k \in \N: k \ge 1Â : p-1 = km$
Hence:

any $m$-th root of unity in $\Q_p$ is a $\paren{p-1}$-th root of unity in $\Q_p$

$\blacksquare$

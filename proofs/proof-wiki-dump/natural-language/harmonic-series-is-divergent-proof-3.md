Theorem
The harmonic series:

$\ds \sum_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty \frac 1 n$
diverges.


Proof
We have that the Integral of Reciprocal is Divergent.
Hence from the Cauchy Integral Test, the harmonic series also diverges.

This page has been identified as a candidate for refactoring of medium complexity.In particular: Work out how to put this into a house format style. Discursive notes like this are discouraged.Until this has been finished, please leave {{Refactor}} in the code.
New contributors: Refactoring is a task which is expected to be undertaken by experienced editors only.

Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.
Note
The Cauchy Integral Test works in both directions.
That is, it can also be used to show that Integral of Reciprocal is Divergent based on Harmonic Series is Divergent.
This could lead to a circular proof.
Hence, if the Cauchy Integral Test is used here, it should not be used to prove Integral of Reciprocal is Divergent.
Instead, use for instance the definition of the natural logarithm as integral of reciprocal.


Due to the organization of pages at $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$, this argument is circular.In particular: Integral of Reciprocal is Divergent depends on this.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by resolving this issue.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{CircularStructure}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.


Historical Note
The proof that the Harmonic Series is Divergent was discovered by Nicole Oresme.
However, it was lost for centuries, before being rediscovered by Pietro Mengoli in $1647$.
It was discovered yet again in $1687$ by Johann Bernoulli, and a short time after that by Jakob II Bernoulli, after whom it is usually (erroneously) attributed.
Some sources attribute its rediscovery to Jacob Bernoulli.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {\CC, \tau_d}$ be the Cantor space.

Then $T$ is a second-countable space.


Proof
We have that the Cantor space is a topological subspace of the real number space with the usual (Euclidean) topology $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$.
We also have that the Real Number Line is Second-Countable.
The result follows from Second-Countability is Hereditary.

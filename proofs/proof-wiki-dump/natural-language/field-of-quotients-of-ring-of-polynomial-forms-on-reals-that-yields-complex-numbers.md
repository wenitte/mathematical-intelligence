Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, +, \times}$ denote the field of real numbers.
Let $X$ be transcendental over $\R$.
Let $\R \sqbrk X$ be the ring of polynomials in $X$ over $F$.
Consider the field of quotients:

$\R \sqbrk X / \ideal p$
where:

$p = X^2 + 1$
$\ideal p$ denotes the ideal generated by $p$.

Then $\R \sqbrk X / \ideal p$ is the field of complex numbers.


Proof
It is taken as read that $X^2 + 1$ is irreducible in $\R \sqbrk X$.
Hence by Polynomial Forms over Field form Principal Ideal Domain: Corollary 1, $\R \sqbrk X / \ideal p$ is indeed a field.
Let $\nu$ be the quotient epimorphism from $\R \sqbrk X$ onto $\R \sqbrk X / \ideal p$.
From Quotient Ring Epimorphism is Epimorphism:

$\map \ker {\map \nu \R} = \R \cap \ideal p = \set 0$

So $\map \nu \R$ is a monomorphism from $\R \sqbrk X$ to $\R \sqbrk X / \ideal p$.
Thus $\map \nu \R$ is an isomorphic copy of $\R$ inside $\R \sqbrk X / \ideal p$.

We identify this isomorphic copy of $\R$ with $\R$ itself, ignoring the difference between $\map \nu x$ and $x$ when $x = \R$.
Hence:

$(1): \quad \R \subseteq \R \sqbrk X / \ideal p$

Let $f \in \R \sqbrk X$ be arbitrary.
By Division Theorem for Polynomial Forms over Field:

$\exists q, r \in \R \sqbrk X: f = q p + r$
where $r =a + b X$ for some $a, b \in \R$.
Hence:














\(\ds \map \nu f\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \nu q \, \map \nu p + \map \nu r\)





as $\nu$ is a ring honomorphism














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \nu r\)





as $p \in \map \ker \nu$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \nu a + \map \nu b \, \map \nu X\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a + b \, \map \nu X\)





as we have identified $\map \nu \R$ with $\R$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a + b i\)





where $i := \map \nu X$




As $\nu$ is an epimorphism, it is a fortiori surjection.
Hence:

$(2): \quad$ Every element $w$ of $\R \sqbrk X / \ideal p$ can be expressed in the form:
$w = a + b i$
for some $a, b \in \R$.

Because $X^2 + 1 \in \ker \nu$, we have:














\(\ds 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \nu {X^2 + 1}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\map \nu X}^2 + \map \nu 1\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds i^2 + 1\)










Hence we have that:

$(3): \quad$ In $\R \sqbrk X / \ideal p$, $i^2 = -1$
Thus $(2)$ can be improved to:

$(4): \quad$ Every element $w$ of $\R \sqbrk X / \ideal p$ can be expressed uniquely in the form:
$w = a + b i$
for some $a, b \in \R$.

From $(1)$, $(3)$ and $(4)$, the field $\R \sqbrk X / \ideal p$ is recognised as the field of complex numbers.

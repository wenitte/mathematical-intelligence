Theorem
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring.
Let $\mathfrak a \subseteq A$ be an ideal.
Let $A / \mathfrak a$ be the quotient ring of $A$ by $\mathfrak a$.

Then $A / \mathfrak a$ is a Noetherian ring.


Proof
Observe that:

$0 \longrightarrow \mathfrak a \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow A / \mathfrak a \longrightarrow 0$
is a short exact sequence of 
$A$-modules.
By Short Exact Sequence Condition of Noetherian Modules, $A / \mathfrak a$ is a Noetherian $A$-module.
As $A / \mathfrak a$ is an $A / \mathfrak a$-module, $A / \mathfrak a$ is also a Noetherian $A / \mathfrak a$-module.
By DefinitionÂ 4 of Noetherian Ring, $A / \mathfrak a$ is a Noetherian ring.

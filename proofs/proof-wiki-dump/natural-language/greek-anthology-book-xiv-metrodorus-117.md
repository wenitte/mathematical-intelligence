Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
$A$. Where are thy apples gone, my child?
$B$. Ino has two-sixths
and Semele one-eighth,
and Autonoe went off with one-fourth,
while Agave snatched from my bosom and carried away a fifth.
For thee ten apples are left,
but I, yes I swear it by dear Cypris, have only this one.


Solution
Let $n$ be the total number of apples.

$\dfrac {2 n} 6$ were taken by Ino.
$\dfrac n 8$ were taken by Semele.
$\dfrac n 4$ were taken by Autonoe.
$\dfrac n 5$ were taken by Agave.
$10$ remained for the child's parent.
$1$ remained for the child.

Hence:














\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 n} 6 + \dfrac n 8 + \dfrac n 4 + \dfrac n 5 + 10 + 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 120 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40 n + 15 n + 30 n + 24 n + 120 \times 11\)





multiplying through by $120 = \lcm \set {6, 8, 4, 5}$ and simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {120 - 40 - 15 - 30 - 24} n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 120 \times 11\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 11 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 120 \times 11\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 120\)










So the narrator started with $120$ apples, of which:

$40$ were taken by Ino
$15$ were taken by Semele
$30$ were taken by Autonoe
$24$ were taken by Agave
and as we know:

$10$ remained for the child's parent
and $1$ remained for the child.

It is understood that $\dfrac {2 n} 6$ is not expressed in canonical form,that is: $\dfrac n 3$, but such is the nature of the epigram.

Theorem
There exists no compass and straightedge construction for the regular heptagon.


Proof
By definition, the regular heptagon has $7$ sides.
$7$ is a prime number which is not a fermat prime.
The result follows Construction of Regular Prime $p$-Gon Exists iff $p$ is Fermat Prime.
$\blacksquare$

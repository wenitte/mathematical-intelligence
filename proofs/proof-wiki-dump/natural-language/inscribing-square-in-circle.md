Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

In a given circle to inscribe a square.
(The Elements: Book $\text{IV}$: Proposition $6$)


Construction

Let $ABCD$ be the given circle.
Let two diameters be drawn at right angles to one another.
Join $AB, BC, CD, DA$.
Then $\Box ABCD$ is the required square.


Proof
We have that $BE = ED$, $EA$ is common and $\angle BEA = \angle DEA$ are right angles.
So from Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence, $\triangle ABE = \triangle ADE$ and so $AB = AD$.
For the same reason $BC = CD = AD$ and so all four sides $AB, BC, CD, DA$ are equal.
So $\Box ABCD$ is equilateral.
Next we have that $BD$ is a diameter of circle $ABCD$.
So from Relative Sizes of Angles in Segments, $\angle BAD$ is a right angle.
For the same reason, $\angle ABC$, $\angle BCD$ and $\angle ADC$ are also all right angles.
So by definition, $\Box ABCD$ is a square.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{IV}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

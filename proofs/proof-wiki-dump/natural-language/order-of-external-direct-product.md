Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ_1}$ and $\struct {T, \circ_2}$ be algebraic structures.
Then the order of $\struct {S \times T, \circ}$ is $\card S \times \card T$.


Proof
By definition the order of $\struct {S \times T, \circ}$ is $\card S \times \card T$ is the cardinality of the underlying set $S \times T$.
The result follows directly from Cardinality of Cartesian Product of Finite Sets.

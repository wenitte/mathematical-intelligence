Theorem
Let $R$ be a ring with unity.
Let $M, N$ be free $R$-modules of finite dimension $m, n > 0$ respectively.
Let $\AA, \BB$ be ordered bases of $M$ and $N$ respectively.
Let $f: M \to N$ be a linear transformation.
Let $\mathbf M_{f, \BB, \AA}$ be its matrix relative to $\AA$ and $\BB$.

Then for all $m \in M$:

$\sqbrk {\map f m}_\BB = \mathbf M_{f, \BB, \AA} \cdot \sqbrk m_\AA$
where $\sqbrk {\, \cdot \,}_-$ denotes the coordinate vector with respect to a basis.


Proof
Both sides are linear in $m$ and they coincide on the elements of $\AA$ by definition of $\mathbf M_{f, \BB, \AA}$.
So they are equal for all $m \in M$.

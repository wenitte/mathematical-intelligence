Theorem
Let $\GF \in \set {\R, \C}$. 
Let $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a normed vector space.
Let $U \subseteq X$.

Then $U$ is von Neumann-bounded if and only if there exists $M > 0$ such that:

$\norm x < M$
for all $x \in U$. 


Proof
From Normed Vector Space is Hausdorff Locally Convex Space, $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ can be viewed as the Hausdorff locally convex space $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$. 
The result is then immediate from Characterization of von Neumann-Boundedness in Hausdorff Locally Convex Space.

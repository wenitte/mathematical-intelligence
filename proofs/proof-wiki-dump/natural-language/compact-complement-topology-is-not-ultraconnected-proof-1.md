Theorem
Let $T = \struct {\R, \tau}$ be the compact complement topology on $\R$.

Then $T$ is not an ultraconnected space.


Proof
By definition, closed sets of $T$ are compact sets of $T$.
So, for example, $\left[{0 \,.\,.\, 1}\right]$ and $\left[{2 \,.\,.\, 3}\right]$ are disjoint compact sets and therefore closed sets of $T$.
Hence the result by definition of ultraconnected.
$\blacksquare$

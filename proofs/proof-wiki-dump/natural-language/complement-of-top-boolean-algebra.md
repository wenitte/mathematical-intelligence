Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \vee, \wedge, \neg}$ be a Boolean algebra.

Then:

$\neg \top = \bot$


Proof
Since $\top$ is the identity for $\wedge$, the second condition for $\neg \top$:

$\top \wedge \neg \top = \bot$
implies that $\neg \top = \bot$ is the only possibility.
Since $\bot$ is the identity for $\vee$, it follows that:

$\top \vee \bot = \top$
and we conclude that:

$\neg \top = \bot$
as desired.
$\blacksquare$

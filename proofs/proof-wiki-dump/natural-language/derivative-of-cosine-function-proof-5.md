Theorem
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\cos x} = -\sin x$


Proof













\(\ds 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cos^2 x + \sin^2 x\)





Sum of Squares of Sine and Cosine








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {D_x} 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {D_x} {\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x}\)





differentiating both sides








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \map {D_x} {\cos x} \cos x  + 2 \sin x \cos x\)





Product Rule for Derivatives or Chain Rule for Derivatives and Derivative of Sine Function








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {D_x} {\cos x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\sin x\)





provided $\cos x \ne 0$



$\blacksquare$

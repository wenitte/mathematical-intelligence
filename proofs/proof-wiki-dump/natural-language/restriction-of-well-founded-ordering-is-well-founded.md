Theorem
Let $S$ be a set or class.
Let $T$ be a subset or subclass of $S$.
Let $\preceq$ be a well-founded ordering of $A$.
Let $\preceq'$ be the restriction of $\preceq$ to $T$.

Then $\preceq'$ is a well-founded ordering of $T$.


Proof
By Restriction of Ordering is Ordering, $\preceq'$ is an ordering.
By Restriction of Well-Founded Relation is Well-Founded, $\preceq'$ is a well-founded relation on $T$.
Hence the result by definition of well-founded ordering.
$\blacksquare$

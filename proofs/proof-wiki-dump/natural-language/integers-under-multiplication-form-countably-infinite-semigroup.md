Theorem
The set of integers under multiplication $\struct {\Z, \times}$ is a countably infinite semigroup.


Proof
From Integers under Multiplication form Semigroup, $\struct {\Z, \times}$ is a countably infinite semigroup.
Then we have that the Integers are Countably Infinite.
The criteria for $\struct {\Z, \times}$ to be a countably infinite semigroup are seen to be satisfied. 
$\blacksquare$

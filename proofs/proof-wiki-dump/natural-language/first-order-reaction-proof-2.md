Theorem
Let a substance decompose spontaneously in a first-order reaction.

Let $x_0$ be a measure of the quantity of that substance at time $t = 0$.
Let the quantity of the substance that remains after time $t$ be $x$.

Then:

$x = x_0 e^{-k t}$
where $k$ is the rate constant.


Proof
From Differential Equation governing First-Order Reaction, the differential equation governing this reaction is given by:

$-\dfrac {\d x} {\d t} = k x$
for $k \in \R_{>0}$.

This is an instance of the Decay Equation, and has the solution:

$x = x_0 e^{-k t}$
$\blacksquare$

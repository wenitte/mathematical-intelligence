Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is locally path-connected.

Then $T$ is also locally connected.


Proof
Let $x \in S$ be any point of $T$.
Let $\BB$ be a local basis of path-connected sets for $x$.
From Path-Connected Space is Connected, $\BB$ is a local basis of connected sets.
Thus, $T$ is locally connected by definition.
$\blacksquare$

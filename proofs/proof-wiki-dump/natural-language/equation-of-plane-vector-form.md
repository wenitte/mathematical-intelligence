Theorem
Let $P$ be a plane which passes through a point $C$ whose position vector relative to the origin $O$ is $\mathbf c$.
Let $\mathbf p$ be the vector perpendicular to $P$ from $O$.
Let $\mathbf r$ be the position vector of an arbitrary point on $P$.

Then $P$ can be represented by the equation:

$\mathbf p \cdot \paren {\mathbf r - \mathbf c} = 0$
where $\cdot$ denotes dot product.


Proof

It is seen that $\mathbf r - \mathbf c$ lies entirely within the plane $P$.
As $P$ is perpendicular to $\mathbf p$, it follows that $\mathbf r - \mathbf c$ is perpendicular to $\mathbf p$.
Hence by Dot Product of Perpendicular Vectors:

$\mathbf p \cdot \paren {\mathbf r - \mathbf c} = 0$
$\blacksquare$


Also presented as
The vector form of the equation of the plane can also be presented in the form:

$\mathbf r \cdot \mathbf n = p$
where:

$\mathbf r$ is the position vector of an arbitrary point on $P$
$\mathbf n$ is the unit normal vector to $P$
$p$ is the length of the normal vector to $P$ through the origin.

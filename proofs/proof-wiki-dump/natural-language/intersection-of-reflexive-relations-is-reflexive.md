Theorem
The intersection of two reflexive relations is also a reflexive relation.


Proof
Let $\RR_1$ and $\RR_2$ be reflexive relations on a set $S$.
From Relation Contains Diagonal Relation iff Reflexive, we have that:

$\Delta_S \subseteq \RR_1$
$\Delta_S \subseteq \RR_2$
Hence from Intersection is Largest Subset:

$\Delta_S \subseteq \RR_1 \cap \RR_2$
Hence the result, from Relation Contains Diagonal Relation iff Reflexive.
$\blacksquare$

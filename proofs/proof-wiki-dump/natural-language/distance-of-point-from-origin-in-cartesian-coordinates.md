Theorem
Let $P = \tuple {x, y}$ be a point in the cartesian plane.

Then $P$ is at a distance of $\sqrt {x^2 + y^2}$ from the origin.


Proof


By definition of the cartesian plane, the point $P$ is $x$ units from the $y$-axis and $y$ units from the $x$-axis.
The $y$-axis and $x$-axis are perpendicular to each other, also by definition.
Thus $x$, $y$ and $OP$ form a right-angled triangle.
By Pythagoras' Theorem:

$OP^2 = x^2 + y^2$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

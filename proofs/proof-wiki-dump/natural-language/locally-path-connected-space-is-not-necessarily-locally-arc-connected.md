Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is locally path-connected.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $T$ is also a locally arc-connected space.


Proof
Let $T$ be the Either-Or topological space.
From Either-Or Topology is Locally Path-Connected, $T$ is a locally path-connected space.
From Either-Or Topology is not Locally Arc-Connected, $T$ is not a locally arc-connected space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

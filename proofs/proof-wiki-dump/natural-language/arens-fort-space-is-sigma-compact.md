Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be the Arens-Fort space.

Then $T$ is a $\sigma$-compact space.


Proof 1
From Arens-Fort Space is Countable we have that $S$ is countably infinite.
Let $\tau_d$ be the discrete topology on $S$.
Consider the identity function $I_S: \struct {S, \tau_d} \to \struct {S, \tau}$.
From Mapping from Discrete Space is Continuous, $I_S$ is continuous.
From Identity Mapping is Surjection, $I_S$ is a surjection.
From Countable Discrete Space is Sigma-Compact and Sigma-Compactness is Preserved under Continuous Surjection we conclude that $T$ is a $\sigma$-compact space.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
The result follows from Arens-Fort Space is Countable and Countable Space is Sigma-Compact.
$\blacksquare$

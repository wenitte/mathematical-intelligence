Example of Radiometric Dating
Let $Q$ be a sample of lead.
Let it be established that $10 \%$ of the radium decays in $200$ years.

After $1000$ years, there will be approximately $59.05 \%$ of the original amount of radium in $Q$.


Proof
From First-Order Reaction, we have:

$x = x_0 e^{-k t}$
where:

$x$ is the quantity of radium at time $t$
$x_0$ is the quantity of radium at time $t = 0$
$k$ is a positive number.
We are given that when $t = 200$, $x = 0.9 \times x_0$.
Hence:














\(\ds 0.9 x_0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x_0 e^{-200 k}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 0.9\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^{-200 k}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds -200 k\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \ln 0.9\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds k\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac {\ln 0.9} {200}\)









So after $1000$ years, we have:














\(\ds \dfrac x {x_0}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^{-1000 \times \paren {-\ln 0.9 / 200} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^{5 \times \ln 0.9}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\approx\)







\(\ds 0.59045\)

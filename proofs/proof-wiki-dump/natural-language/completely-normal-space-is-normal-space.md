Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau}$ be a completely normal space.

Then $\struct {S, \tau}$ is also a normal space.


Proof
Let $\struct {S, \tau}$ be a completely normal space.
From the definition, $\struct {S, \tau}$ is a completely normal space if and only if:

$\struct {S, \tau}$ is a $T_5$ space
$\struct {S, \tau}$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.

We have that a $T_5$ space is a $T_4$ space.
So:

$\struct {S, \tau}$ is a $T_4$ space
$\struct {S, \tau}$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.
which is precisely the definition of a normal space.
$\blacksquare$

Examples of Inverse Mappings
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be the mapping defined on the set of real numbers as:

$\forall x \in \R: \map f x = x^3$
The inverse of $f$ is:

$\forall y \in \R: \inv f y = \sqrt [3] y$


Proof
From Bijection Example: Real Cube Function $f$ is a bijection.
By definition of the cube root:

$\sqrt [3] y := \set {x \in \R: x^3 = y}$
From Inverse Mapping is Bijection, it follows that $f^{-1}$ is likewise a bijection.
$\blacksquare$

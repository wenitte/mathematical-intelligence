Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $2$
De Viro Ambulante in Via
A Walker
A man walking down the road saw others coming towards him, and he said to them,
"I wish there were others with you, as many as you are,
plus a quarter of the sum that would be,
plus half of that last amount.
Then with me there would be $100$ altogether."
How many did he see on the road?


Solution
$36$.


Proof
Let $x$ be the number seen on the road.
Then we have:

$x + x + \dfrac {x + x} 4 + \dfrac 1 2 \paren {\dfrac {x + x} 4} + 1 = 100$
That is, after algebra:

$\dfrac {11 x} 4 = 99$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

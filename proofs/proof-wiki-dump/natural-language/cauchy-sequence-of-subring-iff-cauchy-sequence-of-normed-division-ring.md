Theorem
Let $\struct {R, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a normed division ring.
Let $\struct {S, \norm {\, \cdot \,}_S }$ be a normed division subring of $\struct {R, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$.
Let $\sequence{x_n}$ be a sequence in $S$.

Then:

$\sequence{x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\struct {S, \norm {\, \cdot \,}_S }$
if and only if:

$\sequence{x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\struct {R, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$
Proof
The result follows immediately from:

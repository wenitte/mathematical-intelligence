Theorem
Let $A$ be a set.
Let $\RR$ and $\SS$ be orderings on $A$.

Then their composite $\RR \circ \SS$ is not necessarily also an ordering on $A$.


Proof
Let $\RR$ and $\SS$ be orderings as asserted.
Both $\RR$ and $\SS$ are a fortiori both antisymmetric and transitive.

But we have:

From Composite of Antisymmetric Relations is not necessarily Antisymmetric, it is not necessarily the case that $\RR \circ \SS$ is itself antisymmetric.
From Composite of Transitive Relations is not necessarily Transitive, it is not necessarily the case that $\RR \circ \SS$ is itself transitive.

Hence it is not necessarily the case that $\RR \circ \SS$ is an ordering.
$\blacksquare$

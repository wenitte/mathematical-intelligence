Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $14$
De Bove
An ox
An ox ploughs a field all day.
How many hoofprints does he leave in the last furrow?


Solution
None.


Proof
Trick question.
As the ox walks, he pulls behind him a plough.
A plough turns over the earth as it works, thus obliterating all the hoofprints made by the ox.
$\blacksquare$

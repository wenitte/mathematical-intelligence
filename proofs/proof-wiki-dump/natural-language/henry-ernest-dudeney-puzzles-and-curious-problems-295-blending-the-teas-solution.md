Blending the Teas
A grocer buys two kinds of tea --
one at $2 \shillings 8 \oldpence$ per pound,
and the other, a better quality, at $3 \shillings 4 \oldpence$ per pound.
He mixes together some of each, which he proposes to sell at $3 \shillings 7 \oldpence$ a pound,
and so make a profit of $25$ per cent on the cost.
How many pounds of each kind must he use to make a mixture of $100$ pounds weight?


Solution
$70$ pounds of cheaper tea and $30$ pounds of the more expensive one.


Proof
To simplify the analysis, we express all prices in pence:

$2 \shillings 8 \oldpence$ per pound is $2 \times 12 + 8 = 32 \oldpence$ per pound
$3 \shillings 4 \oldpence$ per pound is $3 \times 12 + 4 = 40 \oldpence$ per pound
$3 \shillings 7 \oldpence$ per pound is $3 \times 12 + 7 = 43 \oldpence$ per pound
$25 \%$ profit on $32 \oldpence$ per pound is $8 \oldpence$, hence the cheaper brand will be selling at $40 \oldpence$ per pound
$25 \%$ profit on $40 \oldpence$ per pound is $10 \oldpence$, hence the dearer brand will be selling at $50 \oldpence$ per pound.

Let $a$ be the weight of cheaper tea going into making the blend.
Let $b$ be the weight of dearer tea going into making the blend.

We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds a + b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





to make a mixture of $100$ pounds weight




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 40 a + 50 b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4300\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 40 \paren {100 - b} + 50 b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4300\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 10 b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4300 - 4000\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 30\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 70\)

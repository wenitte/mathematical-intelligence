Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

To find the fifth binomial straight line.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $52$)


Proof

Let $AC$ and $CB$ be straight lines constructed such that $AB = AC + CB$ is itself a straight line.
Let neither $AB : AC$ nor $AB : BC$ be the ratio which a square number has to a square number.

Let $D$ be a rational straight line.
Let $EF$ be constructed commensurable in length with $D$.
Then $EF$ is also a rational straight line.
Using Porism to Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{X} $: Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable, let:

$CA : AB = EF^2 : FG^2$
where $FG$ is a straight line constructed such that $EG = EF + FG$ is itself a straight line.
From Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{X} $: Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable:

$EF$ and $FG$ are commensurable in square.
But from Proposition $9$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Squares:
$EF$ and $FG$  are incommensurable in length.
Therefore $EF$ and $FG$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Therefore by definition $EG$ is a binomial.

Since:

$CA : AB = EF^2 : FG^2$
while:

$AB > CA$
Therefore:

$GF^2 > FE^2$
Let:

$EF^2 + H^2 = GF^2$
for some $H$.
From Porism to Proposition $19$ of Book $\text{V} $: Proportional Magnitudes have Proportional Remainders:

$AB : BC = GF^2 : H^2$
But $AB : BC$ is not the ratio that a square number has to a square number.
Therefore $FG^2 : H^2$ is not the ratio that a square number has to a square number.
Therefore by Proposition $9$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Squares:

$FG$ is incommensurable in length with $H$.
Therefore $FG^2 > EF^2$ by the square on a straight line which is incommensurable in length with $FG$.
We have that:

$EF$ and $FG$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only
and:

the lesser term $EF$ is commensurable in length with $D$.
Therefore $EG$ is a fifth binomial straight line.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $52$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

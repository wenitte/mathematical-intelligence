Theorem
Let $\struct {L_1, \vee_1, \wedge_1, \preceq_1}$ and $\struct {L_2, \vee_2, \wedge_2, \preceq_2}$ be frames.

The following definitions of the concept of Frame Isomorphism are equivalent:

Definition 1
Let $\phi: L_1 \to L_2$ be a (frame) homomorphism.

Then $\phi$ is a frame isomorphism if and only if $\phi$ is a bijection.


Definition 2
Let $\phi: L_1 \to L_2$ be a mapping.

Then $\phi$ is a frame isomorphism if and only if $\phi$ is an order isomorphism


Proof
Definition 1 implies Definition 2
$\Box$

Definition 2 implies Definition 1
$\blacksquare$

Example of Use of Bézout's Theorem
Two conic sections meet in at most $4$ points.


Proof
From Conic Section is Curve of Second Order, the degree of the polynomial defining a conic section is $2$.
Hence, by Bézout's Theorem two such conic sections meet in at most $2 \times 2 = 4$ points.
$\blacksquare$

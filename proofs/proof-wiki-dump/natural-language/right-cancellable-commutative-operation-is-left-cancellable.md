Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be an algebraic structure.
Let $\circ$ be right cancellable and also commutative.

Then $\circ$ is also left cancellable.


Proof
Let $\circ$ be both right cancellable and commutative on a set $S$.
Then:














\(\ds a \circ b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \circ c\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b \circ a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c \circ a\)





$\circ$ is Commutative








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c\)





$\circ$ is Right Cancellable



$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\R$ denote the real numbers.
Let $f$ and $g$ be real functions which are continuous on an open subset $S \subseteq \R$.

Then:

$f - g$ is ‎continuous on $S$.


Proof
We have that:

$\map {\paren {f - g} } x = \map {\paren {f + \paren {-g} } } x$
From Multiple Rule for Continuous Real Functions:

$-g$ is ‎continuous on $S$.
From Sum Rule for Continuous Real Functions:

$f + \paren {-g}$ is ‎continuous on $S$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

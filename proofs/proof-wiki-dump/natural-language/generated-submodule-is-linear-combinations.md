Theorem
Let $G$ be a unitary $R$-module.
Let $S \subseteq G$.

Then the submodule $H$ generated by $S$ is the set of all linear combinations of $S$.


Proof
First the extreme case:
The smallest submodule of $G$ containing $\O$ is $\set {e_G}$.
By definition of linear combination of empty set, $\set {e_G}$ is the set of all linear combinations of $\O$.

Now the general case:
Let $\O \subset S \subseteq G$.
Let $L$ be the set of all linear combinations of $S$.
Since $G$ is a unitary $R$-module, every element $x \in S$ is the linear combination $1_R x$, so $S \subseteq L$.
But $L$ is closed for addition and scalar multiplication, so is a submodule.
Thus $H \subseteq L$.
But as every linear combination of $S$ clearly belongs to any submodule of $G$ which contains $S$, we also have $L \subseteq H$.
$\blacksquare$

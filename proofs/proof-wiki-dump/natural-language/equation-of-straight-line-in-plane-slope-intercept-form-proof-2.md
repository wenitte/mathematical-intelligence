Theorem
Let $\LL$ be the straight line in the Cartesian plane such that:

the slope of $\LL$ is $m$
the $y$-intercept of $\LL$ is $c$

Then $\LL$ can be described by the equation:

$y = m x + c$

such that $m$ is the slope of $\LL$ and $c$ is the $y$-intercept.


Proof
By definition, the $y$-intercept of $\LL$ is $\tuple {0, c}$.
We calculate the $x$-intercept $X = \tuple {x_0, 0}$ of $\LL$:














\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {c - 0} {0 - x_0}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x_0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac c m\)










Hence from the two-intercept form of the Equation of straight line in the plane, $\LL$ can be described as:














\(\ds \dfrac x {-c / m} + \dfrac y c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)

Theorem
Let $z \in \C$ be a complex number.
Let $t > 0$ be wholly real.
Let $t^z$ be $t$ to the power of $z$ defined on its principal branch.

Then:

$\cmod {t^z} = t^{\map \Re z}$


Proof













\(\ds \cmod {t^z}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cmod {t^{\map \Re z + i \map \Im z} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cmod {t^{\map \Re z} t^{i \map \Im z} }\)

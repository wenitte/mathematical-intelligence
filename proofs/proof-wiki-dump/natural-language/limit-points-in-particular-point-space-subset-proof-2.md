Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a particular point space.
Let $U \subseteq S$ such that $p \in U$.
Let $x \in S$ such that $x \ne p$.

Then $x$ is a limit point of $U$.


Proof
Follows directly from:

Particular Point Topology is Closed Extension Topology of Discrete Topology
Limit Points in Subset of Closed Extension Space
$\blacksquare$

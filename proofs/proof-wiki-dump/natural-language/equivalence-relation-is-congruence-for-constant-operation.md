Theorem
Every equivalence relation is a congruence relation for the constant operation.


Proof
Let $c \in S$.
By the definition of the constant operation:

$\forall x, y \in S: x \sqbrk c y = c$

Let $\RR$ be an equivalence relation on $S$.
Every equivalence relation is reflexive, so:

$c \mathrel \RR c$
So:














\(\ds x_1 \mathrel \RR x_2\)

\(\land\)







\(\ds y_1 \mathrel \RR y_2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {x_1 \sqbrk c y_1}\)

\(\RR\)







\(\ds \paren {x_2 \sqbrk c y_2}\)





True Statement is implied by Every Statement



Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

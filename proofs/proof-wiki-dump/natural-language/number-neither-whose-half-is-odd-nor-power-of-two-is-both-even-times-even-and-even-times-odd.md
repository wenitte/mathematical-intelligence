Theorem
Let $a \in \Z$ be an integer such that:

$(1): \quad a$ is not a power of $2$
$(2): \quad \dfrac a 2$ is an even integer.

Then $a$ is both even-times even and even-times odd.

In the words of Euclid:

If a number neither be one of those which are continually doubled from a dyad, nor have its half odd, it is both even-times even and even-times odd.
(The Elements: Book $\text{IX}$: Proposition $34$)


Proof
As $\dfrac a 2$ is an even integer it follows that:

$\dfrac a 2 = 2 r$
for some $r \in \Z$.
That is:

$a = 2^2 r$
and so $a$ is even-times even by definition.
$\Box$

Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $a$ is not even-times odd.
Then $a$ does not have an odd divisor.
Thus in its prime decomposition there are no odd primes.
Thus $a$ is in the form:

$a = 2^k$
for some $k \in \Z_{>0}$.
That is, $a$ is a power of $2$.
This contradicts condition $(1)$.
From this contradiction it is deduced that $a$ is even-times odd.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $34$ of Book $\text{IX}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

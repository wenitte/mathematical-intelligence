Example of Relation which is not a Mapping
Let $R_2$ be the relation defined on the Cartesian plane $\R \times \R$ as:

$R_2 = \set {\tuple {x, y} \in \R \times \R: x y = 1}$
Then $R_2$ is not a mapping.


Proof
  Graph of $x y = 1$
$R_2$ fails to be a mapping for the following reason:

For $x = 0$, there exists no $y \in \R$ such that $x y = 1$.
Thus $R_2$ fails to be left-total.
$\blacksquare$

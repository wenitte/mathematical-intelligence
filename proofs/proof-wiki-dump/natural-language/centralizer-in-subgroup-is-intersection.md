Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.

Then:

$\forall x \in G: \map {C_H} x = \map {C_G} x \cap H$
That is, the centralizer of an element in a subgroup is the intersection of that subgroup with the centralizer of the element in the group.


Proof
It is clear that:

$g \in \map {C_H} x \iff g \in \map {C_G} x \land g \in H$
The result follows by definition of set intersection.

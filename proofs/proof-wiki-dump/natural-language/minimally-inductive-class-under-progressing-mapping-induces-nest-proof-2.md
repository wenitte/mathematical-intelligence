Theorem
Let $M$ be a class which is minimally inductive under a progressing mapping $g$.
Then $M$ is a nest in which:

$\forall x, y \in M: \map g x \subseteq y \lor y \subseteq x$


Proof
A minimally inductive class under $g$ is the same thing as a minimally closed class under $g$ with respect to $\O$.
The result then follows by a direct application of Minimally Closed Class under Progressing Mapping induces Nest.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\KK$ be a rectangular hyperbola whose transverse axis and conjugate axis are of length $2 a$.
Let $\KK$ be aligned in a cartesian plane in reduced form.

$\KK$ can be expressed by the equation:

$x^2 - y^2 = a^2$


Proof
From Equation of Hyperbola in Reduced Form in Cartesian Frame, a hyperbola can be expressed by the equation:

$\dfrac {x^2} {a^2} - \dfrac {y^2} {b^2} = 1$
For a rectangular hyperbola:

$a = b$
Hence $\KK$ can be expressed by the equation:

$\dfrac {x^2} {a^2} - \dfrac {y^2} {a^2} = 1$
Multiplying both sides by $a^2$

$x^2 - y^2 = a^2$
$\blacksquare$

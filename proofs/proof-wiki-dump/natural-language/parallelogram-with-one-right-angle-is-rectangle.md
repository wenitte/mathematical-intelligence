Theorem
Let $\Box ABCD$ be a parallelogram.
Let one angle of $\Box ABCD$ be a right angle.
Then $\Box ABCD$ is a rectangle.


Proof
Without loss of generality, let $\angle ABC$ be a right angle.
Let $\angle CDA$ be opposite $\angle ABC$.
By Opposite Sides and Angles of Parallelogram are Equal:

$\angle CDA = \angle ABC$
By Sum of Internal Angles of Polygon:

the sum of the angles of $\Box ABCD$ is four right angles.
Hence:
$\angle DAB + \angle BCD$ together equal two right angles.
By Opposite Sides and Angles of Parallelogram are Equal:

$\angle DAB = \angle BCD$
Hence, all four angles of $\Box ABCD$ are right angles.
By Opposite Sides and Angles of Parallelogram are Equal:

$AB = CD$
$AD = BC$
$\leadsto$

$\Box ABCD$ is a rectangle.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

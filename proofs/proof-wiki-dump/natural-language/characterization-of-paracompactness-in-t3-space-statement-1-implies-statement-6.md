Theorem
Let $T = \struct{X, \tau}$ be a topological space.

If $T$ is paracompact then:

every open cover of $T$ has an open $\sigma$-locally finite refinement
Proof
Let $T$ be paracompact.

By definition of paracompact:

every open cover of $T$ has an open locally finite refinement

From Locally Finite Set of Subsets is Sigma-Locally Finite Set of Subsets

every open cover of $T$ has an open $\sigma$-locally finite refinement
$\blacksquare$

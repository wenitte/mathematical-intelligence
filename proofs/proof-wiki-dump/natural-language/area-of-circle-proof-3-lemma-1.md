Lemma for Area of Circle: Proof 3

Construct a circle with radius $r$ and circumference $c$, whose area is denoted by $C$.
Construct a triangle with height $r$ and base $c$, whose area is denoted by $T$.
Then:

$T = \pi r^2$


Proof













\(\ds T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {r c} 2\)





Area of Triangle in Terms of Side and Altitude














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {r 2 \pi r} 2\)





Perimeter of Circle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \pi r^2\)









$\blacksquare$

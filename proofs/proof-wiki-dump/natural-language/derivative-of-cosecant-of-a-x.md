Corollary to Derivative of Cosecant Function
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\csc a x} = -a \csc a x \cot a x$


Proof













\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\csc x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\csc x \cot x\)





Derivative of $\csc x$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\csc a x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -a \csc a x \cot a x\)

Theorem
Consider the subset $S$ of the complex plane defined as:

$S := \set {\dfrac i n : n \in \Z_{>0} }$
That is:

$S := \set {i, \dfrac i 2, \dfrac i 3, \dfrac i 4, \ldots}$
where $i$ is the imaginary unit.

$S$ is not an open region.


Proof
From Sequence of Imaginary Reciprocals: Openness, $S$ is not an open set.
From Sequence of Imaginary Reciprocals: Connectedness, $S$ is not connected.
Hence, by definition, $S$ is not an open region of $\C$.
$\blacksquare$

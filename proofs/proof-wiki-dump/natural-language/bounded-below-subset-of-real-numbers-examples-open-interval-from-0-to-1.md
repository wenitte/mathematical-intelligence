Example of Bounded Below Subset of Real Numbers
Let $I$ be the open real interval defined as:

$I := \openint 0 1$
Then $I$ is bounded below by, for example, $0$, $-1$ and $-2$, of which $0$ is the infimum.
However, $I$ does not have a smallest element.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $x \in I$ is the smallest element of $I$.
Then $0 < \dfrac x 2 < x$ by Mediant is Between.
Thus $\dfrac x 2 \in I$ but $x > \dfrac x 2$.
So $x$ is not the smallest element of $I$ after all.
So by Proof by Contradiction it follows that $I$ has no smallest element.
$\blacksquare$

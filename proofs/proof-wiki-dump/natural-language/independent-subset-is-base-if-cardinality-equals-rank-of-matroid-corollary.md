Theorem
Let $M = \struct {S, \mathscr I}$ be a matroid.
Let $B \subseteq S$ be a base of $M$.
Let $X \subseteq S$ be any independent subset of $M$.
Let $\card X = \card B$.

Then:

$X$ is a base of $M$.


Proof
From All Bases of Matroid have same Cardinality:

$\card B = \map \rho S$
where $\rho$ denotes the rank function on $M$.
Hence:

$\card X = \map \rho S$
From Independent Subset is Base if Cardinality Equals Rank of Matroid:

$X$ is a base of $M$.
$\blacksquare$

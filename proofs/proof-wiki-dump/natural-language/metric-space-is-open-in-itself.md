Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space.

Then the set $A$ is an open set of $M$.


Proof
By definition, an open set $S \subseteq A$ is one where every point inside it is an element of an open ball contained entirely within that set.
Let $x \in A$.
An open ball of $x$ in $M$ is by definition a subset of $A$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Examples
Closed Real Interval
Let $\R$ be the real number line considered as an Euclidean space.
Let $\closedint a b \subset \R$ be a closed interval of $\R$.
Then from Closed Real Interval is not Open Set, $\closedint a b$ is not an open set of $\R$.
However, if $\closedint a b$ is considered as a subspace of $\R$, then it is seen that $\closedint a b$ is an open set of $\closedint a b$.

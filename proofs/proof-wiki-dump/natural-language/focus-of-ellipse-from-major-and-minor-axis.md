Theorem
Let $K$ be an ellipse whose major axis is $2 a$ and whose minor axis is $2 b$.
Let $c$ be the distance of the foci of $K$ from the center.
Then:

$a^2 = b^2 + c^2$


Proof


Let the foci of $K$ be $F_1$ and $F_2$.
Let the vertices of $K$ be $V_1$ and $V_2$.
Let the covertices of $K$ be $C_1$ and $C_2$.

Let $P = \tuple {x, y}$ be an arbitrary point on the locus of $K$.
From the equidistance property of $K$ we have that:

$F_1 P + F_2 P = d$
where $d$ is a constant for this particular ellipse.
This is true for all points on $K$.

In particular, it holds true for $V_2$, for example.
Thus:














\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds F_1 V_2 + F_2 V_2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a + c} + \paren {a - c}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 a\)










It also holds true for $C_2$:

$F_1 C_2 + F_2 C_2 = d$
Then:














\(\ds F_1 C_2^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds O F_1^2 + O C_2^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds c^2 + b^2\)









and:














\(\ds F_1 C_2^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds O F_1^2 + O C_2^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds c^2 + b^2\)









Thus:














\(\ds F_1 C_2 + F_2 C_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \sqrt {b^2 + c^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 a\)





as $2 a = d$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {b^2 + c^2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b^2 + c^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2\)

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a finite complement topology on an infinite set $S$.
Let $T \times D$ be the double pointed topology on $T$.

Then $T \times D$ is compact.


Proof
The Finite Complement Topology is Compact.
Also, a Finite Topological Space is Compact.
So $D$, defined as the indiscrete space on a doubleton, is also compact.
The result follows directly from Tychonoff's Theorem.

Theorem
Let $\struct {k, \norm {\,\cdot\,} }$ be a valued field.
Then there exists a completion $\struct {k', \norm {\,\cdot\,}'}$ of $\struct {k, \norm {\,\cdot\,} }$ such that $\struct {k', \norm {\,\cdot\,}'}$ is a valued field.
Furthermore, every completion of $\struct{k, \norm {\,\cdot\,} }$ is isometrically isomorphic to $\struct {k', \norm {\,\cdot\,}'}$.


Proof
By Completion of Normed Division Ring then $\struct {k, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ has a normed division ring completion $\struct {k', \norm {\, \cdot \,}'}$
By Normed Division Ring is Field iff Completion is Field then $\struct {k', \norm {\, \cdot \,}'}$ is a field.
By Normed Division Ring Completions are Isometric and Isomorphic then every completion of $\struct {k, \norm {\,\cdot\,} }$ is isometrically isomorphic to $\struct {k', \norm {\,\cdot\,}'}$.
$\blacksquare$


Examples
The completion of $\Q$ with respect to the usual absolute value is $\R$
The completion of $\Q$ with respect to the $p$-adic norm is known as the field of $p$-adic numbers and denoted $\Q_p$
By Ostrowski's Theorem there are no other completions of $\Q$ as a valued field.

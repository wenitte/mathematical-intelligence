Theorem
Let $\CC$ be a circle on center $O$.
Let $AB$ and $CD$ be chords in $\CC$ with $AB \parallel CD$.
Then the two chords  cut from the circle by $AB$ and $CD$ are equal:

$AC = BD$
Proof

Draw $AD$.
By Parallelism implies Equal Alternate Angles:

$\angle BAD = \angle ADC$
The central angles corresponding to $\angle BAD$ and $\angle ADC$ are equal by Inscribed Angle Theorem:

$\angle BOD = \angle AOC$
As radii of $\CC$:

$OB = OD = OC = OA$
By Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence:

$\triangle OAC \cong \triangle OBD$
So:

$AC = BD$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
A dominated strategy of a game may be the optimal strategy for a player of that game.


Proof
Consider the game defined by the following payoff table:




 


$\text B$


$\text A$


$\begin{array} {r {{|}} c {{|}} }
& B_1 & B_2 \\
\hline A_1 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline A_2 & 1 & 3  \\
\hline \end{array}$


This has two solutions:

$(1): \quad A: \tuple {1, 0}, B: \tuple {1, 0}$
$(2): \quad A: \tuple {0, 1}, B: \tuple {1, 0}$

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: The reason why the above are solutions is not indicated.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Thus both pure strategies for $A$ are optimal, but $A_1$ is dominated by $A_1$.
$\blacksquare$

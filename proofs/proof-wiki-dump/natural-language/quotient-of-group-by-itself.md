Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $G / G$ be the quotient group of $G$ by itself.

Then:

$G / G \cong \set e$
That is, the quotient of a group by itself is isomorphic to the trivial group.


Proof
Let the homomorphism $\phi: G \to \set e$ be defined as:

$\forall g \in G: \map \phi g = e$
Then:

$\map \ker \phi = G$
and:

$\Img \phi = \set e$
By the First Isomorphism Theorem:

$G / \map \ker \phi \cong \Img \phi$
Hence the result:

$G / G \cong \set e$
$\blacksquare$

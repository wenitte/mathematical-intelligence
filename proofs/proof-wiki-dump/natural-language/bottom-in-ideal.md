Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be a bounded below ordered set.
Let $I$ be a ideal in $S$.

Then $\bot \in I$
where $\bot$ denotes the smallest element of $S$.


Proof
By definition of ideal in ordered set:

$I$ is non-empty and lower.
By definition of non-empty set:

$\exists x: x \in I$
By definition of smallest element:

$\bot \preceq x$
Thus by definition of lower section:

$\bot \in I$
$\blacksquare$

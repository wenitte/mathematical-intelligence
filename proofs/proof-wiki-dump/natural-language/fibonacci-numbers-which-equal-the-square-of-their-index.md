Theorem
The only Fibonacci numbers which equal the square of their index are:














\(\ds F_0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds F_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)




















\(\ds F_{12}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12^2 = 144\)











Proof
By definition of the Fibonacci numbers:














\(\ds F_0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds F_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)









Then it is observed that $F_{12} = 144$.
After that, for $n > 12$, we have that $F_n > n^2$.
$\blacksquare$

Square Fibonacci Number: after $144$, there are no more square Fibonacci numbers at all.

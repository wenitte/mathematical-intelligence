Theorem
Let $\LL$ be a straight line embedded in a cartesian plane $\CC$.
Let $\LL$ be given in homogeneous Cartesian coordinates by the equation:

$l X + m Y + n Z = 0$
such that $l$ and $m$ are not both zero.

Then $\LL$ intersects:

the $x$-axis $Y = 0$ at the point $\tuple {-n, 0, l}$
the $y$-axis $X = 0$ at the point $\tuple {0, -n, m}$

When $l = 0$, $\LL$ is parallel to the $x$-axis with its point at infinity at $\tuple {-n, 0, 0}$
When $m = 0$, $\LL$ is parallel to the $y$-axis with its point at infinity at $\tuple {0, -n, 0}$.


Proof
The intersection of $\LL$ with the $x$-axis is the point $\tuple {X, Y, Z}$ satisfied by:














\(\ds l X + m Y + n Z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds Y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds l X + n Z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)









which is satisfied by setting $X = -n$ and $Z = l$, while $Y = 0$.

The intersection of $\LL$ with the $y$-axis is the point $\tuple {X, Y, Z}$ satisfied by:














\(\ds l X + m Y + n Z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds X\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m Y + n Z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)









which is satisfied by setting $Y = -n$ and $Z = m$, while $X = 0$.

When $l = 0$ we have:














\(\ds m Y + n Z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds Y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n Z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)










When $m = 0$ we have:














\(\ds l X + n Z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds X\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n Z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)










The result follows.

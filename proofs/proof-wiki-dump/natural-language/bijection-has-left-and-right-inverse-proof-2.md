Theorem
Let $f: S \to T$ be a bijection.
Let:

$I_S$ be the identity mapping on $S$
$I_T$ be the identity mapping on $T$.
Let $f^{-1}$ be the inverse of $f$.

Then:

$f^{-1} \circ f = I_S$
and:

$f \circ f^{-1} = I_T$
where $\circ$ denotes composition of mappings.


Proof
Suppose $f$ is a bijection.
From Bijection iff Inverse is Bijection and Composite of Bijection with Inverse is Identity Mapping, it is shown that the inverse mapping $f^{-1}$ such that:

$f^{-1} \circ f = I_S$
$f \circ f^{-1} = I_T$
is a bijection.

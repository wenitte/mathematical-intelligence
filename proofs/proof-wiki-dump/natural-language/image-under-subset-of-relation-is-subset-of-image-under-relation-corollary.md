Theorem
Let $S$ and $T$ be sets.
Let $\RR_1 \subseteq S \times T$ be a relation in $S \times T$.
Let $\RR_2 \subseteq \RR_1$.
Let $x \in S$.

Then:

$\map {\RR_2} x \subseteq \map {\RR_1} x$
where $\map {\RR_1} x$ denotes the image of $x$ under $\RR_1$.


Proof













\(\ds \map {\RR_2} x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \RR_2 \sqbrk {\set x}\)





Image of Singleton under Relation














\(\ds \)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds \RR_1 \sqbrk {\set x}\)





Image under Subset of Relation is Subset of Image under Relation














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\RR_1} x\)





Image of Singleton under Relation



$\blacksquare$

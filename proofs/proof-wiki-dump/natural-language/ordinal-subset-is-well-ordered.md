Theorem
Let $S$ be a class.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Is the $S$ really a class? All links below are for a set.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Let every element of $S$ be an ordinal.

Then $\struct {S, \in}$ is a strict well-ordering.


Proof

Although this article appears correct, it's inelegant. There has to be a better way of doing it.In particular: wrong use of linksYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by redesigning it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Improve}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Let $\On$ denote the class of all ordinals.
By definition of subset, $S \subseteq \On$.

But by Class of All Ordinals is Ordinal $\On$ is an ordinal.
Therefore $\On$ is well-ordered by $\in$.

This means that $S$ is also well-ordered by $\in$.
$\blacksquare$

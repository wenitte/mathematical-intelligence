Right and Left
At what time between three and four o'clock will the minute hand be as far from $12$ on the left side of the dial plate as the hour hand is from $12$ on the right side of the dial plate?


Solution
$41 \tfrac 7 {13}$ past $3$.



Proof
Let $T$ be the time in question.
Let $m$ be the number of minutes past $3:00$ that $T$ is.
Let $\theta \degrees$ be the angle made by the minute hand with respect to twelve o'clock at time $T$.
Let $\phi \degrees$ be the angle made by the hour hand with respect to twelve o'clock at time $T$.
Between $3:00$ and $4:00$ we have that $90 < \phi < 120$.
Hence from Condition for Valid Time Indication, we have that:

$12 \paren {\phi - 90} = \theta$
Then we are told that:

$\theta = 360 - \phi$
Hence:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 360 - \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \phi\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 12 \paren {\phi - 90}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \theta\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 12 \paren {360 - \theta - 90}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \theta\)





substituting for $\phi$ in $(2)$ from $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 13 \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12 \times 270\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12 \times 270} {13}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12 \times 270} {13} \times \dfrac 1 6\)





Speed of Minute Hand














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 41 \tfrac 7 {13}\)





calculating



Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

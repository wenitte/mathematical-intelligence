Theorem
Let $q$ be a point charge.
Let $\map {\mathbf E} {\mathbf r}$ be the electric field strength due to $q$ at a point $P$ whose position vector is $\mathbf r$.

The direction of the electric field due to $q$ at $P$ is:

for positive $q$, directly away from $q$
for negative $q$, directly towards $q$.


Proof
From Electric Field caused by Point Charge:














\(\ds \map {\mathbf E} {\mathbf r}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {4 \pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac {q \paren {\mathbf r - \mathbf r_q} } {\size {\mathbf r - \mathbf r_q}^3}\)





Electric Field caused by Point Charge



By definition of vector subtraction, $\mathbf r - \mathbf r_q$ is the vector from $\mathbf r_q$ to $\mathbf r$.
Hence if $q$ is positive, the direction of $\map {\mathbf E} {\mathbf r}$ is towards $\mathbf r$, which is directly away from $q$.

Similarly, if $q$ is negative, the direction of $\map {\mathbf E} {\mathbf r}$ is $-\paren {\mathbf r - \mathbf r_q}$.
That is, the direction of $\map {\mathbf E} {\mathbf r}$ is $\mathbf r_q - \mathbf r$.
By definition of vector subtraction, $\mathbf r_q - \mathbf r$ is the vector from $\mathbf r$ to $\mathbf r_q$.
This is directly towards $q$.

The following diagram shows the lines of force of $\map {\mathbf E} {\mathbf r}$ as arrows, pointing away from $+q$:

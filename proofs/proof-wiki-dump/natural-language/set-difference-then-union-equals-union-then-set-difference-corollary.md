Corollary of Set Difference Then Union Equals Union Then Set Difference
Let $S, T$ be sets.
Let $A \subseteq S \setminus T$.
Let $B \subseteq T \setminus S$.

Then:

$\paren{S \setminus A} \cup B = \paren{S \cup B} \setminus A$


Proof
From Set Difference is Disjoint with Reverse:

$\paren{S \setminus T} \cap \paren{T \setminus S} = \O$

From Subsets of Disjoint Sets are Disjoint:

$A \cap B = \O$

From Set Difference Then Union Equals Union Then Set Difference:

$\paren{S \setminus A} \cup B = \paren{S \cup B} \setminus A$
$\blacksquare$

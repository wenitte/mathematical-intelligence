Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is second-countable.

Then $T$ is also a Lindelöf space.


Proof
Let $T$ be second-countable.
Then by definition its topology has a countable basis.
Let $\BB$ be this countable basis.
Let $\CC$ be an open cover of $T$.
Every set in $\CC$ is the union of a subset of $\BB$.
So $\CC$ itself is the union of a subset of $\BB$.
This union of a subset of $\BB$ is therefore a countable subcover of $\CC$.
That is, $T$ is by definition Lindelöf.
$\blacksquare$

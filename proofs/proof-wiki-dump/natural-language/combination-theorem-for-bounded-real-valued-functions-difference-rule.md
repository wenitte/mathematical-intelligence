Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $f, g :S \to \R$ be bounded real-valued functions.
Let $f - g : S \to \R$ be the pointwise addition of $f$ and $g$, that is, $f - g$ is the mappping defined by:

$\forall s \in S : \map {\paren{f - g} } s = \map f s - \map g s$

Then:

$f - g$ is a bounded real-valued function


Proof
From Pointwise Difference is Pointwise Addition with Negation:

$f - g = f + \paren{-g}$
where:

$-g$ denotes the pointwise negation of $g$
$f + \paren{-g}$ denotes the pointwise addition of $f$ and $-g$

From Negation Rule for Bounded Real-Valued Function:

$-g$ is a bounded real-valued function
From Sum Rule for Bounded Real-Valued Functions

$f + \paren{-g}$ is a bounded real-valued function
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

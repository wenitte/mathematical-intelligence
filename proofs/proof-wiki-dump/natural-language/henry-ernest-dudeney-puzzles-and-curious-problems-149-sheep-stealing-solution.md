Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $149$
Sheep Stealing
Some sheep stealers made a raid and carried off one-third of the flock of sheep, and one-third of a sheep.
Another party stole one-fourth of what remained, and one-fourth of a sheep.
Then a third party of raiders carried off one-fifth of the remainder and three-fifths of a sheep,
leaving $409$ behind.
What was the number of sheep in the flock?


Solution
The flock originally contained $1025$ sheep.


Proof
Let $n$ be the number of sheep in the flock.
Let $n_1$ and $n_2$ be the numbers remaining after the first and second raids respectively.
We have:














\(\ds 409\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n_2 - \paren {\dfrac {n_2} 5 + \dfrac 3 5}\)





Then a third party of raiders carried off one-fifth of the remainder and three-fifths of a sheep, leaving $409$ behind.














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {4 n_2 - 3} 5\)





simplification








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 512\)





simplification


















\(\ds 512\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n_1 - \paren {\dfrac {n_1} 4 + \dfrac 1 4}\)





Another party stole one-fourth of what remained, and one-fourth of a sheep.














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {3 n_2 - 1} 4\)





simplification








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 683\)





simplification


















\(\ds 683\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n - \paren {\dfrac n 3 + \dfrac 1 3}\)





Some sheep stealers made a raid and carried off one-third of the flock of sheep, and one-third of a sheep.














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 n_1 - 1} 3\)





simplification








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1025\)





simplification

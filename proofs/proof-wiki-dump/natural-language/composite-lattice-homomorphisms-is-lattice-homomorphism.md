Theorem
Let $L_1 = \struct{A_1, \vee_1, \wedge_1, \preceq_1}$, $L_2 = \struct{A_2, \vee_2, \wedge_2, \preceq_2}$ and $L_3 = \struct{A_3, \vee_3, \wedge_3, \preceq_3}$ be lattices.

Let $\phi_1: L_1 \to L_2$ and $\phi_2: L_2 \to L_3$ be lattice homomorphisms.
Let $\phi_2 \circ \phi_1Â : A_1 \to A_3$ be the composite mapping of $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$  

Then:

$\phi_2 \circ \phi_1$ is a lattice homomorphism of $L_1$ to $L_3$


Proof
Follows immediately from Composite of Homomorphisms is Homomorphism

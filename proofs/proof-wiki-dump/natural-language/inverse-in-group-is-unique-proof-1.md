Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group.

Then every element $x \in G$ has exactly one inverse:

$\forall x \in G: \exists_1 x^{-1} \in G: x \circ x^{-1} = e^{-1} = x^{-1} \circ x$
where $e$ is the identity element of $\struct {G, \circ}$.


Proof
By the definition of a group, $\struct {G, \circ}$ is a monoid each of whose elements has an inverse.
The result follows directly from Inverse in Monoid is Unique.

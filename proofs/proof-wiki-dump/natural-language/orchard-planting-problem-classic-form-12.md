Classic Problem
$12$ trees are to be planted in an orchard so as to make the number of rows of $3$ trees the largest number possible.
That is:
$12$ points are to be configured in the plane so that the number of straight lines that can be drawn through exactly $3$ of these points is maximised.


Solution


The number of rows is $19$.
$3$ of the points are at infinity.
One of the $19$ rows is also at infinity, and passes through each of those $3$ points.
$\blacksquare$

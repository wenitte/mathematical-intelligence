Theorem
Let $T$ be a complete $\LL$-theory.
Let $\mathfrak C$ be a monster model for $T$.
Let $A\subseteq B$ be subsets of the universe of $\mathfrak C$.
Let $\map \pi {\bar x}$ be an $n$-type over $B$.

$\pi$ forks over $A$ if and only if a finite subset of $\pi$ forks over $A$.


Proof
Suppose $\pi$ forks over $A$.

By definition, $\pi$ implies a disjunction of formulas which each divide over $A$.
Since proofs are finite, this means that there is a finite subset of $\pi$ which implies this disjunction, completing this direction of the proof.

Suppose a finite subset of $\pi$ forks over $A$.

By definition, the finite subset implies a disjunction of formulas which each divide over $A$.
But then $\pi$ clearly implies this disjunction as well, completing this direction of the proof.

Example of Use of Divisor Count Function
The value of the divisor count function for the integer $1$ is $1$.


Proof
By definition, the divisor count function of an integer $n$ is the number of positive integer divisors of $n$.
There is only one positive integer which is a divisor of $1$, and that is $1$ itself.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

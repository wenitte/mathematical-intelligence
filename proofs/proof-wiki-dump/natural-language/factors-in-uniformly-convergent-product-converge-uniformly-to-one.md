Theorem
Let $X$ be a set.
Let $\struct {\mathbb K, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a valued field.
Let $\sequence {f_n}$ be a sequence of bounded mappings $f_n: X \to \mathbb K$.
Let the infinite product $\ds \prod_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty f_n$ converge uniformly on $X$.

Then $f_n$ converges uniformly to $1$.


Proof
Follows directly from Uniformly Convergent Product Satisfies Uniform Cauchy Criterion.

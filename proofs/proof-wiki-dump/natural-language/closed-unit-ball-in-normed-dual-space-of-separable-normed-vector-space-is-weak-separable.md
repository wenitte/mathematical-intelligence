Theorem
Let $X$ be a separable normed vector space.
Let $X^\ast$ be the normed dual space of $X$. 
Let $B^-_{X^\ast}$ be the closed unit ball of $X^\ast$.
Let $w^\ast$ be the weak-$\ast$ topology on $B^-_{X^\ast}$.

Then $\struct {B^-_{X^\ast}, w^\ast}$ is separable. 


Proof
From the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem, $\struct {B^-_{X^\ast}, w^\ast}$ is compact. 
From Closed Unit Ball in Normed Dual Space of Separable Normed Vector Space is Weak-* Metrizable, $\struct {B^-_{X^\ast}, w^\ast}$ is metrizable. 
From Compact Metric Space is Separable, we have that $\struct {B^-_{X^\ast}, w^\ast}$ is separable.
$\blacksquare$

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $15$
Buying Turkeys
A man bought a number of turkeys at a cost of $\pounds 60$,
and after reserving fifteen of the birds he sold the remainder for $\pounds 54$,
thus gaining $2 \shillings$ a head by these.
How may turkeys did he buy?


Solution
$75$ turkeys for $16 \shillings$ each.
He sold $60$ turkeys for $18 \shillings$ each.


Proof
Let $n$ be the number of turkeys bought.
Let $t_1 \shillings$ be the price he paid per turkey for the original $n$ turkeys.
Let $t_2 \shillings$ be the price he sold the remaining $n - 15$ turkeys for.
All monetary values will be expressed in shillings.
We have:














\(\ds n t_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60 \times 20\)





A man bought a number of turkeys at a cost of $\pounds 60$,














\(\ds \paren {n - 15} t_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 54 \times 20\)





and after reserving fifteen of the birds he sold the remainder for $\pounds 54$,














\(\ds t_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t_1 + 2\)





thus gaining $2 \shillings$ a head by these.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {n - 15} \paren {t_1 + 2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 54 \times 20\)





eliminating $t_2$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n t_1 + 2 n - 15 t_1 - 30\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 54 \times 20\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 60 \times 20 + 2 n - 15 \times \dfrac {60 \times 20} n - 30\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 54 \times 20\)





as $n t_1 = 60 \times 20$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n^2 + 45 n - 9000\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {-45 \pm \sqrt {45^2 + 4 \times 9000} } 2\)





Quadratic Formula














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {-45 \pm 195} 2\)





calculating














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 75 \text { or } -120\)









Clearly only the positive solution makes sense.
$\blacksquare$

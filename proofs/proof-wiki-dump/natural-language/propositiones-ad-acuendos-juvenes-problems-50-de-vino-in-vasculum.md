Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $50$
De Vino in Vasculum
Wine in Flasks
How many sextarii are there in $100$ metri of wine,
and how many meri are there in the same $100$ metri?


Solution
$4800$ sextarii
which is:

$28 \, 800$ meri.


Proof
There are $48$ sextarii to the metra.
There are $6$ meri to the sextarius.
Thus the number of sextarii in $100$ metri is:

$48 \times 100 = 4800$
and the meri in $100$ metri is:

$6 \times 4800 = 28 \, 800$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The original text from Alcuin gives that there are $289$ meri to the metra, rather than the $288$ that are obtained by straightforward multiplication.
It is not clear whether this is what the exact number of them is, or whether Alcuin made a mistake in his arithmetic when multiplying $48$ by $6$.

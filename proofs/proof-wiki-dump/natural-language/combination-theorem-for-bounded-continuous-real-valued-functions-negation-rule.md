Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $f :S \to \R$ be a bounded continuous real-valued function.
Let $-f : S \to \R$ denote the pointwise negation of $f$, that is,  $-f$ denotes the mapping defined by:

$\forall s \in S : \map {\paren{-f} } s = - \map f s$

Then:

$-f$ is a bounded continuous real-valued function


Proof
Follows from:

Negation Rule for Bounded Real-Valued Function
Negation Rule for Continuous Real-Valued Function
$\blacksquare$

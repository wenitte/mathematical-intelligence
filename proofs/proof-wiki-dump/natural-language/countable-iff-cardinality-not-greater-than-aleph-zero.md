Theorem
Let $X$ be set.
$X$ is countable if and only if:
$\card X \le \aleph_0$
where:

$\card X$ denotes the cardinality of $X$
$\aleph_0 = \card \N$ by Aleph Zero equals Cardinality of Naturals.


Proof
$X$ is countable
if and only if:

there exists an injection $f: X \to \N$ by definition of countable set
if and only if:

$\card X \le \card \N$ by Injection iff Cardinal Inequality
if and only if:

$\card X \le \aleph_0$
$\blacksquare$

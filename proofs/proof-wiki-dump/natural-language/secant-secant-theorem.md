Theorem
Let $C$ be a point external to a circle $ABED$.
Let $CA$ and $CB$ be straight lines which cut the circle at $D$ and $E$ respectively.

Then:

$CA \cdot CD = CB \cdot CE$


Proof

Draw $CF$ tangent to the circle.
From the Tangent Secant Theorem we have that:

$CF^2 = CA \cdot CD$
$CF^2 = CB \cdot CE$
from which the result is obvious and immediate.

The Secant Secant Theorem is also known as the Intersecting Secant Theorem or just the Secant Theorem.

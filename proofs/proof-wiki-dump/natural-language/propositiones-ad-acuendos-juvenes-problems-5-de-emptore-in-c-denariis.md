Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $5$
De Emptore in $\text C$ Denariis
A Merchant and $100$ Pence
A merchant wanted to buy $100$ pigs at $100$ pence.
For a boar he would pay $10$ pence;
and for a sow $5$ pence;
while he would pay $1$ penny for a couple of piglets.
How many boars, sows and piglets must there have been for him to have paid exactly $100$ pence for the $100$ animals?


Solution
$1$ boar
$9$ sows
$90$ piglets.


Proof
Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ denote the number of boars, sows and piglets respectively.
We are to solve for $x, y, z \in \N$:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 10 x + 5 y + \dfrac z 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds x + y + z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 19 x + 9 y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





$(1) \times 2 - (2)$



Note that both $x$ and $y$ need to be (strictly) positive.
We need to find possible values of $x$ such that $100 - 19 x$ is divisible by $9$.
Inspecting possible contenders for such an $x$ individually:












\(\, \ds x = 1: \, \)

\(\ds 100 - 19 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 81\)


















\(\, \ds x = 2: \, \)

\(\ds 100 - 19 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 62\)


















\(\, \ds x = 3: \, \)

\(\ds 100 - 19 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 43\)


















\(\, \ds x = 4: \, \)

\(\ds 100 - 19 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 24\)


















\(\, \ds x = 5: \, \)

\(\ds 100 - 19 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)









Only one of these satisfies the condition, that is:

$x = 1$
$y = 9$
which leaves:

$z = 100 - 1 - 9 = 90$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
David Singmaster remarks that this is the first European appearance of a one hundred fowls problem.

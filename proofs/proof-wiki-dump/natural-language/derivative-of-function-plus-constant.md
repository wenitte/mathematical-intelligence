Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function which is differentiable on $\R$.
Let $c \in \R$ be a constant.

Then:

$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\map f x + c} = \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\map f x}$


Proof













\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\map f x + c}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\map f x} + \map f x \, c\)





Sum Rule for Derivatives














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\map f x} + 0\)





Derivative of Constant














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\map f x}\)

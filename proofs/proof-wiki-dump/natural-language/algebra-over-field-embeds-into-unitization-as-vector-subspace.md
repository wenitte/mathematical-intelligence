Theorem
Let $K$ be a field.
Let $A$ be an algebra over $K$ that is not unital. 
Let $A_+$ be the unitization of $A$.
Let:

$A_0 = \set {\tuple {x, 0_K}Â : x \in A} \subseteq A_+$.

Then $A_0$ is a vector subspace of $A_+$.


Proof
This follows from Vector Subspace of Algebra over Field Embeds into Unitization as Vector Subspace.
$\blacksquare$

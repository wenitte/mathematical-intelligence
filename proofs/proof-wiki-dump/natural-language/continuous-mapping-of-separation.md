Theorem
Let $T$ and $T'$ be topological spaces.
Let $A \mid B$ be a separation of $T$.
Let $f: T \to T'$ be a mapping such that the restrictions $f \restriction_A$ and $f \restriction_B$ are both continuous.

Then $f$ is continuous on the whole of $T$.


Proof
Follows directly from Pasting Lemma for Union of Open Sets.
$\blacksquare$

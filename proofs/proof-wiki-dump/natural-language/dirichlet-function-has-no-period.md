Theorem
The Dirichlet functions are periodic by Dirichlet Function is Periodic.
However, they do not admit a period.

That is, there does not exist a smallest value $L \in \R_{> 0}$ such that:

$\forall x \in \R: \map D x = \map D {x + L}$


Proof
Let $D: \R \to \R$ be a Dirichlet function.

In proving that the Dirichlet Function is Periodic, it was shown that every non-zero rational number is a periodic element of $D$.
Therefore, the period of $D$ must be the smallest element of $\Q_{> 0}$.
But from Rational Numbers are not Well-Ordered under Conventional Ordering there cannot exist such an element.
Hence the result.

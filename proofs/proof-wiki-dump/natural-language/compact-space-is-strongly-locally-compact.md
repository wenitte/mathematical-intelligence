Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a compact space.

Then $T$ is a strongly locally compact space.


Proof
From Underlying Set of Topological Space is Clopen, $S$ is clopen in $T$.
From Closed Set Equals its Closure, $S = S^-$.
So every point of $S$ is contained in an open set (that is, $S$) whose closure (that is, $S$ again) is compact (as  $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ itself is compact).
That is precisely the definition of a strongly locally compact space.
$\blacksquare$

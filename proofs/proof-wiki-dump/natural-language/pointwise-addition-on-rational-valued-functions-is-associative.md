Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $f, g, h: S \to \Q$ be rational-valued functions.
Let $f + g: S \to \Q$ denote the pointwise sum of $f$ and $g$.

Then:

$\paren {f + g} + h = f + \paren {g + h}$

That is, pointwise addition on rational-valued functions is associative.


Proof









\(\ds \forall x \in S: \, \)



\(\ds \map {\paren {\paren {f + g} + h} } x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\map f x + \map g x} + \map h x\)

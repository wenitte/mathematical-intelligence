Theorem
Let $T$ be a topological space.
Let $H \subseteq T$.
Let $H^-$ be the closure of $H$ in $T$.

Then:

$H \subseteq H^-$


Proof
From the definition of closure, we have:

$H^-$ is the union of $H$ and its limit points.
From Subset of Union it follows directly that:

$H \subseteq H^-$
$\blacksquare$

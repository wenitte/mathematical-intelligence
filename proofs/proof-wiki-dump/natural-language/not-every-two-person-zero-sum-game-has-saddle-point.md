Theorem
Not every two-person zero-sum game has a saddle point.


Proof
Consider the game of Matching Pennies.
Recall its payoff table:




 


$\text B$


$\text A$


$\begin{array}{r {{|}} c {{|}} } & \text{H} & \text{T} \\ \hline \text{H} &  1, -1 & -1, 1 \\ \hline \text{T} & -1, 1 &  1, -1 \\ \hline \end{array}$


Trivially, by inspection, this has no entry which is the smallest entry in its row and the largest entry in its column.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$\map \arctan 1 = \dfrac \pi 4$


Proof
By definition, $\arctan$ is the inverse of the tangent function's restriction to $\openint {-\dfrac \pi 2} {\dfrac \pi 2}$. 
By Tangent of $45 \degrees$: 

$\tan \dfrac \pi 4 = 1$.
As $\dfrac \pi 4 \in \openint {-\dfrac \pi 2} {\dfrac \pi 2}$, we have by the definition of an inverse function: 

$\map \arctan 1 = \dfrac \pi 4$
$\blacksquare$

Corollary to Derivative of Absolute Value Function
Let $u$ be a differentiable real function of $x$.
Then:

$\dfrac \d {\d x} \size u = \dfrac u {\size u} \dfrac {\d u} {\d x}$
for $u \ne 0$.
At $u = 0$, $\size u$ is not differentiable.


Proof
From Derivative of Absolute Value Function:

$\dfrac \d {\d u} \size u = \dfrac u {\size u}$
Hence by the Chain Rule for Derivatives:

$\dfrac \d {\d x} \size u = \dfrac u {\size u} \dfrac {\d u} {\d x}$
$\blacksquare$

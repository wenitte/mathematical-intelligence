Example of Bijection
Let $\mathbb S$ be one of the standard number systems $\Z$, $\Q$, $\R$, $\C$.
Let $h: \mathbb S \to \mathbb S$ be the negation function defined on $\mathbb S$:

$\forall x \in \mathbb S: \map h x = -x$
Then $h$ is a bijection.


Proof
Complex Numbers
By the definition of the negative of complex number, the complex negation function is defined on the complex numbers $\C$ as:

$-z := -x - i y$
Let $z_1 = x_1 + i y_1, z_2 = x_2 + i y_2 \in \C$ such that $\map h {z_1} = \map h {z_2}$.














\(\ds \map h {z_1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map h {z_2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds -z_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -z_2\)

\(\ds -x_1 - i y_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -x_2 - i y_2\)

\(\ds -x_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -x_2\)

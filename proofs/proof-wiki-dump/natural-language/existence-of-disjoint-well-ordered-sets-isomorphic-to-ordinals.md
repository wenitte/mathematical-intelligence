Theorem
Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be ordinals.

Then there exist two well-ordered sets $a$ and $b$ such that:

$a$ and $b$ are order isomorphic to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively
$a$ and $b$ are disjoint.


Proof
Let $a$ and $b$ be defined as:














\(\ds a\)

\(:=\)







\(\ds \alpha \times \set 0\)




















\(\ds b\)

\(:=\)







\(\ds \beta \times \set 1\)









Then let $a$ and $b$ be ordered by their first coordinate.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

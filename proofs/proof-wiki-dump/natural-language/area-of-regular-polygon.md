Theorem
Let $P$ be a regular $n$-sided polygon whose side length is $b$.
Then the area of $P$ is given by:

$\Box P = \dfrac 1 4 n b^2 \cot \dfrac \pi n$
where $\cot$ denotes cotangent.


Proof

Let $H$ be the center of the regular $n$-sided polygon $P$.
Let one of its sides be $AB$.
Consider the triangle $\triangle ABH$.
As $P$ is regular and $H$ is the center, $AH = BH$ and so $\triangle ABH$ is isosceles.
Thus $b = AB$ is the base of $\triangle ABH$.
Let $h = GH$ be its altitude.
See the diagram.

Then:














\(\ds \triangle ABH\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {b h} 2\)





Area of Triangle in Terms of Side and Altitude














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac b 2 \frac b 2 \cot \alpha\)





Definition of Cotangent of Angle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {b^2} 4 \cot \frac \pi n\)





$\alpha$ is half the apex of $\triangle ABH$, and $n$ of such apices fit into the full circle of $2 \pi$




The full polygon $P$ is made up of $n$ such triangles, each of which has the same area as $\triangle ABH$.
Hence:

$\Box P = \dfrac 1 4 n b^2 \cot \dfrac \pi n$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\mathbf a$ be a vector quantity.
Let $m$ be a scalar quantity.
Then:

$m \mathbf a = m \paren {\size {\mathbf a} \hat {\mathbf a} } = \paren {m \size {\mathbf a} } \hat {\mathbf a}$
where:

$\size {\mathbf a}$ denotes the magnitude of $\mathbf a$
$\hat {\mathbf a}$ denotes the unit vector in the direction $\mathbf a$.


Proof













\(\ds \mathbf a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \size {\mathbf a} \hat {\mathbf a}\)





Vector Quantity as Scalar Product of Unit Vector Quantity








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m \mathbf a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m \paren {\size {\mathbf a} \hat {\mathbf a} }\)

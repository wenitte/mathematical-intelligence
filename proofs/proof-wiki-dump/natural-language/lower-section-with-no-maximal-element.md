Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $L \subseteq S$.

Then:

$L$ is a lower section in $S$ with no maximal element
if and only if:

$\ds L = \bigcup \set {l^\prec: l \in L}$
where $l^\prec$ is the strict lower closure of $l$.


Proof
By Dual Pairs (Order Theory):

Lower section is dual to upper section.
Maximal element is dual to minimal element.
Strict lower closure is dual to strict upper closure.
Thus the theorem holds by the duality principle applied to Upper Section with no Minimal Element.
$\blacksquare$

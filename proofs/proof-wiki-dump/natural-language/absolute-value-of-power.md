Theorem
Let $x$, $y$ be real numbers.
Let $x^y$, $x$ to the power of $y$, be real.
Then:

$\size {x^y} = \size x^y$


Proof
If $x = 0$, the theorem clearly holds, by the definition of powers of zero.

Suppose $x \ne 0$.
We use the interpretation of real numbers as wholly real complex numbers.
Likewise we interpret the absolute value of $x$ as the modulus of $x$.
Then $x$ can be expressed in polar form:

$x = r e^{i\theta}$
where $r = \size x$ and $\theta$ is an argument of $x$.
Then:














\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds r e^{i\theta}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \left(r{e^{i\theta} }\right)^y\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds r^y e^{i \theta y}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \size {x^y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \size {r^y e^{i \theta y} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \size {r^y} \size {e^{i \theta y} }\)





Modulus of Product














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \size {r^y}\)





Modulus of Exponential of Imaginary Number is One














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \size {\size x^y}\)





by definition of $r$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \size x^y\)





as $\size x^y \ge 0$

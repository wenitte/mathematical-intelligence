Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a Hausdorff topological space.
Let $K \subset S$ be a compact subspace of $T$.

Then its boundary $\partial K$ is compact.


Proof
By Compact Subspace of Hausdorff Space is Closed, $K$ is closed in $T$.
By Boundary of Compact Closed Set is Compact, $\partial K$ is compact.
$\blacksquare$

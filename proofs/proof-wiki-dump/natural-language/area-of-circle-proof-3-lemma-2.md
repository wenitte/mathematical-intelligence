Lemma for Area of Circle: Proof 3

Construct a circle with radius $r$ and circumference $c$, whose area is denoted by $C$.
Construct a triangle with height $r$ and base $c$, whose area is denoted by $T$.
Then:

$T \ge C$


Proof

Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $T < C$.
It should be possible to construct a regular polygon with area $P$, where $T < P < C$.
For any given regular polygon:

$P = \dfrac {h q} 2$
where:

$q$ is the perimeter of the regular polygon
$h$ is the height of any given triangular part of it
$P$ is the area.
Onthe one hand:

$P > T \implies \dfrac {h q} 2 > \dfrac {r c} 2$
On the other hand:

$0 < h < r \land 0 < q < c \implies \dfrac {h q} 2 < \dfrac {r c} 2$
Hence a contradiction is obtained.
Hence:

$\neg T < C$
and so:

$T \ge C$
$\blacksquare$

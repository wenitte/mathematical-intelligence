Theorem
Let $D \subset \C$ be an open set.
Let $\sequence {f_n}$ be a sequence of analytic functions $f_n: D \to \C$.
Let $\ds \prod_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty f_n$ converge locally uniformly to $f$.

Then $f$ is analytic.


Proof
Follows directly from:

Partial Products of Uniformly Convergent Product Converge Uniformly
Uniform Limit of Analytic Functions is Analytic
$\blacksquare$

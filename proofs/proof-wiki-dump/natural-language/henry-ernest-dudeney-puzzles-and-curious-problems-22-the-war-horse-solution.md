Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $22$
The War Horse
Farmer Wurzel bought a old war horse for $\pounds 13$ and sold it later for $\pounds 30$.
After having paid for its keep, it turned out he lost half the price he paid and one-quarter the cost of his keep.
How much did Farmer Wurzel lose on the transaction?


Solution
$\pounds 14, 6 \shillings 8 \oldpence$


Proof
Let $L$ be the loss made on the warhorse in pounds.
Let $K$ be the cost of the upkeep of the warhorse in pounds.
Then we have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13 - 30 + K\)





Farmer Wurzel bought a old war horse for $\pounds 13$ and sold it later for $\pounds 30$ ... After having paid for its keep ...




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {13} 2 + \dfrac K 4 + K\)





... he lost half the price he paid and one-quarter the cost of his keep.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4 L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 26 + K\)





simplifying $(2)$














\(\ds K\)

\(=\)







\(\ds L + 17\)





simplifying $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4 L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 26 + L + 17\)





substituting for $K$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 3 L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 43\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {43} 3\)





simplifying














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 14 \tfrac 1 3\)









Converting the result into pounds and shillings reveals the solution.
$\blacksquare$

Corollary to Euclid's Theorem
There are infinitely many prime numbers.


Proof
Assume that there are only finitely many prime numbers.
Let $p$ be the largest of these.
Then from Existence of Prime between Prime and Factorial there exists a prime number $q$ such that:

$p < q \le p! + 1$
So there cannot be such a $p$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\tuple {A, \ast, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a $\text C^\ast$ algebra such that:

$A \ne \set { {\mathbf 0}_A}$
where ${\mathbf 0}_A$ is the zero vector of $A$. 
Then there exists a Hermitian element $x \in A \setminus \set { {\mathbf 0}_A}$. 


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose that ${\mathbf 0}_A$ is the only Hermitian element of $A$. 
Let $a \in A$. 
From Element of *-Algebra Uniquely Decomposes into Hermitian Elements, there exists Hermitian elements $b, c$ such that:

$a = b + ic$
Since ${\mathbf 0}_A$ is the only Hermitian element of $A$, we have $b = {\mathbf 0}_A$ and $c = {\mathbf 0}_A$.
We would then have $a = {\mathbf 0}_A$, contradicting that $A \ne \set { {\mathbf 0}_A}$. 
Hence there are Hermitian elements of $A$ other than ${\mathbf 0}_A$.

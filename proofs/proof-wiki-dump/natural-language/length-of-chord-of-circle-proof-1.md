Theorem
Let $C$ be a circle of radius $r$.
Let $AB$ be a chord which joins the endpoints of the arc $ADB$.
Then:

$AB = 2 r \sin \dfrac \theta 2$
where $\theta$ is the angle subtended by $AB$ at the center of $C$.


Proof

Let $O$ be the center of $C$.
Let $AB$ be bisected by $OD$.

Consider the pair of triangles $\triangle AOE$ and $\triangle BOE$.
We see that:

$AE = ED$ since $AB$ is bisected by $OD$
$AO = BO$ since they are radii
$OE = OE$ since they are common sides.
By Triangle Side-Side-Side Congruence:

$\triangle AOE = \triangle BOE$

Then we have:

$\angle AOE = \angle BOE = \dfrac \theta 2$
$\angle OEA = \angle OEB = \dfrac {180 \degrees} 2 = 90 \degrees$

By Definition of Sine Function:

$\sin \dfrac \theta 2 = \dfrac {AE} {AO} = \dfrac {\frac 1 2 AB} r$
Rearranging, we get:

$AB = 2 r \sin \dfrac \theta 2$
as desired.

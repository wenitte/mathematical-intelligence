Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau}$ be a regular space.

Then $\struct {S, \tau}$ is also a semiregular space.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a regular space.
From the definition:

$\struct {S, \tau}$ is a $T_3$ space
$\struct {S, \tau}$ is a $T_0$ (Kolmogorov) space.
We also have that a $T_3$ Space is Semiregular.
Hence the result, by definition of semiregular space.
$\blacksquare$

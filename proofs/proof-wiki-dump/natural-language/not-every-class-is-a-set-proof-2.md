Theorem
Let $A$ be a class.
Then it is not necessarily the case that $A$ is also a set.


Proof
Consider the universal class $V$.
From Class has Subclass which is not Element, $V$ has a subclass $A$ which is not an element of $V$.
But $V$ contains as elements all the sets.
It follows that $A$ is a class which is not a set.
$\blacksquare$

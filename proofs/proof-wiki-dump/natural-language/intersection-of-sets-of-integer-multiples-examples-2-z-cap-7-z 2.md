Examples of Use of Intersection of Sets of Integer Multiples
Let $m \Z$ denote the set of integer multiples of $m$.
Then:

$2 \Z \cap 7 \Z = 14 \Z$


Proof
From Intersection of Sets of Integer Multiples

$2 \Z \cap 7 \Z = \lcm \set {2, 7} \Z$
We have that:

$2 \perp 7$
where $\perp$ denotes coprimality.
Then from LCM equals Product iff Coprime:

$\lcm \set {2, 7} = 2 \times 7 = 14$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

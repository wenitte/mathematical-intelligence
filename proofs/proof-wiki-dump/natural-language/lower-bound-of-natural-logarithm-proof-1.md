Theorem
$\forall x \in \R_{>0}: 1 - \dfrac 1 x \le \ln x$
where $\ln x$ denotes the natural logarithm of $x$.


Proof
Let $x > 0$.














\(\ds x - 1\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds \ln x\)





Upper Bound of Natural Logarithm








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac 1 x -1\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds \ln \frac 1 x\)





putting $\frac 1 x$ into the above inequality














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\ln x\)





Logarithm of Reciprocal








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 1 - \frac 1 x\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds \ln x\)





multiplying throughout by $-1$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $C$ be a chain in $S$.
Let $m$ be a minimal element of $C$.

Then $m$ is the smallest element of $C$.


Proof
Let $x \in C$.
Since $m$ is minimal in $C$, $x \nprec m$.
Since $C$ is a chain, $x = m$ or $m \prec x$.
Thus for each $x \in C$, $m \preceq x$.
Therefore $m$ is the smallest element of $C$.
$\blacksquare$

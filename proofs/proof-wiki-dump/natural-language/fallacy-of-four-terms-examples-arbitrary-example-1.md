Examples of Fallacy of Four Terms
The following is an example of the fallacy of four terms:

$(1): \quad$ All metals are elements.
$(2): \quad$ Brass is a metal.
$(3): \quad$ Therefore, brass is an element.


Resolution
It is common to refer to an alloy as an example of a metal.
That is how the word metal is used in $(2)$.
However, when used in $(1)$, the word metal is being used in its exclusive sense, that is, metals which are elements.
Hence there are $4$ terms in the syllogism:

metal, in the true sense
Chemical element
Brass
metal, in the sense which includes alloys.
$\blacksquare$

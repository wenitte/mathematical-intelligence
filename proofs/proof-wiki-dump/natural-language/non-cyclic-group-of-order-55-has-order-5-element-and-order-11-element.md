Example of Order of Group Element
Let $G$ be a non-cyclic group whose order is $55$.
Then $G$ has:

at least $1$ element of order $5$
at least $1$ element of order $11$.


Proof
By Order of Element Divides Order of Finite Group, all elements of $G$ have order in $\set {1, 5, 11, 55}$.
But as $G$ is non-cyclic, it can have no element of order $55$.
By Identity is Only Group Element of Order 1, $G$ has $54$ elements of order $5$ and $11$.

Let $m$ denote the number of subgroups of $G$ of order $5$.
Let $n$ denote the number of subgroups of $G$ of order $11$.
From Number of Order p Elements in Group with m Order p Subgroups, $G$ has:

$4 m$ elements of order $5$
$10 n$ elements of order $11$.
Then:

$4 m + 10 n = 54$
As neither $4$ nor $10$ divide $54$, it follows that neither $n$ nor $m$ are equal to $0$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

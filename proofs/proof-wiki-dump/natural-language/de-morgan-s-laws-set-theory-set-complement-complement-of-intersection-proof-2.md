Theorem
$\overline {T_1 \cap T_2} = \overline T_1 \cup \overline T_2$


Proof













\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds x \in \overline {T_1 \cap T_2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\leadstoandfrom\)







\(\ds x \notin \paren {T_1 \cap T_2}\)





Definition of Set Complement














\(\ds \)

\(\leadstoandfrom\)







\(\ds \neg \paren {x \in T_1 \land x \in T_2}\)





Definition of Set Intersection














\(\ds \)

\(\leadstoandfrom\)







\(\ds \neg \paren {x \in T_1} \lor \neg \paren {x \in T_2}\)





De Morgan's Laws (Logic): Disjunction of Negations














\(\ds \)

\(\leadstoandfrom\)







\(\ds x \in \overline {T_1} \lor x \in \overline {T_2}\)





Definition of Set Complement














\(\ds \)

\(\leadstoandfrom\)







\(\ds x \in \overline {T_1} \cup \overline {T_2}\)









By definition of set equality:

$\overline {T_1 \cap T_2} = \overline {T_1} \cup \overline {T_2}$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T$ be a topological space.
Let $H \subseteq T$.

Let $H^\circ$ denote the interior of $H$.
Let $H^-$ denote the closure of $H$.

Then:

$H^\circ \subseteq \left({H^-}\right)^\circ$


Proof
From Set is Subset of its Topological Closure, we have $H \subseteq H^-$.
The result follows directly from Interior of Subset.
$\blacksquare$

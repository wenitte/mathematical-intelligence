Theorem
Let $ABCD$ be a kite such that:

$AC$ and $BD$ are its diagonals
$AB = BC$
$AD = DC$
Then $BD$ is the perpendicular bisector of $AC$.


Proof


Let $AC$ and $BD$ meet at $E$.
From Diagonals of Kite are Perpendicular, $AC$ and $BD$ are perpendicular.
That is:

$\angle AEB = \angle CEB$
both being right angles.

Consider the triangles $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle CBE$.
We have that:

$\angle AEB = \angle CEB$ are both right angles.
$AB = BC$
$BE$ is common
Hence by Triangle Right-Angle-Hypotenuse-Side Congruence, $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle CBE$ are congruent.

Thus:

$AE = CE$
and it has already been established that $BD$ is perpendicular to $AC$.

Hence the result by definition of perpendicular bisector.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a paracompact space.
Then $T$ is a countably paracompact space.


Proof
From the definition, $T$ is paracompact space if and only if every open cover of $T$ has an open refinement which is locally finite.
This also applies to all countable open covers.
So every countable open cover of $T$ has an open refinement which is locally finite.
This is precisely the definition for a countably paracompact space.
$\blacksquare$

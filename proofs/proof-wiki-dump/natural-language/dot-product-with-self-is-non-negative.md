Theorem
Let $\mathbf u$ be a vector in the real Euclidean space $\R^n$.
Then:

$\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u \ge 0$
where $\cdot$ denotes the dot product operator.


Proof 1













\(\ds \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sum_{i \mathop = 1}^n {u_i}^2\)





Definition of Dot Product














\(\ds \)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds 0\)





as $u_i \in \R$ it follows that ${u_i}^2 \ge 0$



$\blacksquare$


Proof 2













\(\ds \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \norm {\mathbf u}^2\)





Dot Product of Vector with Itself














\(\ds \)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds 0\)





Square of Real Number is Non-Negative

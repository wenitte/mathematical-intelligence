Theorem
Every proposition entails itself:

$\vdash p \implies p$


Proof
By the tableau method of natural deduction:


$\vdash p \implies p$


Line


Pool

$p \implies p$

Rule of Implication: $\implies \II$

Assumption 1 has been discharged
$\blacksquare$

This is the second shortest tableau proof possible.

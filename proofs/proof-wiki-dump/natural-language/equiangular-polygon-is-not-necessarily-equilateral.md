Theorem
Let $P$ be an equiangular polygon with more than $3$ sides.
Then it is not necessarily the case that $P$ is also equilateral.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample
We take as an example the rectangle:

A rectangle is a quadrilateral all of whose angles are equal to a right angle, and whose sides may or may not all be the same length.
$\blacksquare$

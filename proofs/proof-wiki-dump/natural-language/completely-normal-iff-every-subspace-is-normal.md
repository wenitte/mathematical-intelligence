Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.

Then $T$ is a completely normal space if and only if every subspace of $T$ is normal.


Proof
From the definitions, we have that:

$T$ is a completely normal space if and only if:
$\struct {S, \tau}$ is a $T_5$ space
$\struct {S, \tau}$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.
$T$ is a normal space if and only if:
$\struct {S, \tau}$ is a $T_4$ space
$\struct {S, \tau}$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.

From $T_1$ Property is Hereditary, any subspace of a $T_1$ space is also a $T_1$ space.
Then we have that a space is $T_5$ iff every subspace is $T_4$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

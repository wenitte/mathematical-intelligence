Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a countably paracompact space.
Then $T$ is countably metacompact.


Proof
From the definition, $T$ is countably paracompact if and only if every countable open cover of $X$ has an open refinement which is locally finite.
Consider some countable open cover $\UU$ of $X$.
Let $x \in X$.
Then there exists some neighborhood $\N_x$ of $x$ which intersects only finitely many elements of $\UU$.
Thus $x$ itself can be in only finitely many elements of $\UU$.
Hence $T$ must be, by definition, countably metacompact.
$\blacksquare$

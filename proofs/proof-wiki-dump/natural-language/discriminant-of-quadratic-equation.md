Theorem
Let $\QQ$ be the quadratic equation:

$a x^2 + b x + c$
The discriminant of $\QQ$ is given by:

$\map \Delta \QQ = \dfrac {b^2 - 4 a c} {a^2}$


Proof
Let $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ be the roots of $\QQ$.
We have:














\(\ds \map \Delta \QQ\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\alpha_1 - \alpha_2}^2\)





Discriminant Example: Quadratic














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds {\alpha_1}^2 - 2 \alpha_1 \alpha_2 + {\alpha_2}^2\)





Square of Difference














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds {\alpha_1}^2 + 2 \alpha_1 \alpha_2 + {\alpha_2}^2 - 4 \alpha_1 \alpha_2\)





adding and subtracting $2 \alpha_1 \alpha_2$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\alpha_1 + \alpha_2}^2 - 4 \alpha_1 \alpha_2\)





Square of Sum














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {-\dfrac b a}^2 - 4 \dfrac c a\)





Sum of Roots of Quadratic Equation, Product of Roots of Quadratic Equation














\(\ds \)

Also presented as
While the discriminant $\Delta$ of a quadratic equation $\QQ: a x^2 + b x + c = 0$ is properly given as:

$\map \Delta \QQ = \dfrac {b^2 - 4 a c} {a^2}$
it is usual and practically universal that $\map \Delta \QQ$ is given as:

$\map \Delta \QQ = b^2 - 4 a c$
This is because we are usually interested only in the sign of $\map \Delta \QQ$ and not its actual value.
Indeed, we note that as $a^2 > 0$, multiplying or dividing by $a^2$ has no effect on that sign.

Theorem
The dot product is an inner product.


Proof
Let $\mathbf u, \mathbf v \in \R^n$.
We will check the four defining properties of an inner product in turn.


Conjugate Symmetry













\(\ds \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \mathbf v \cdot \mathbf u\)





Dot Product Operator is Commutative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \overline{\mathbf v \cdot \mathbf u}\)





Complex Number equals Conjugate iff Wholly Real



Thus the dot product possesses conjugate symmetry.
$\Box$


Bilinearity
From Dot Product Operator is Bilinear, the dot product possesses bilinearity.
$\Box$


Non-Negative Definiteness
From Dot Product with Self is Non-Negative, the dot product possesses non-negative definiteness.
$\Box$


Positiveness
From Dot Product with Self is Zero iff Zero Vector, the dot product possesses positiveness.
$\Box$

Hence the dot product satisfies the definition of an inner product.
$\blacksquare$

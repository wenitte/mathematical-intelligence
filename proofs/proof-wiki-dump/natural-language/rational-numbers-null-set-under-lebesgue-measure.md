Theorem
Let $\lambda$ be $1$-dimensional Lebesgue measure on $\R$.
Let $\Q$ be the set of rational numbers.

Then:

$\map \lambda \Q = 0$
that is, $\Q$ is a $\lambda$-null set.


Proof
We have that the Rational Numbers are Countably Infinite.
The result follows from Countable Set is Null Set under Lebesgue Measure.

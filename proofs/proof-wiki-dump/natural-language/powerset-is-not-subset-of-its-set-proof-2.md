Theorem
Let $A$ be a set.
Then:

$\powerset A \not \subseteq A$


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose that $\powerset A \subseteq A$.
Let $I: \powerset A \to A$ be the identity mapping.
$I$ is an injection by Identity Mapping is Injection.
But by No Injection from Power Set to Set, this is a contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

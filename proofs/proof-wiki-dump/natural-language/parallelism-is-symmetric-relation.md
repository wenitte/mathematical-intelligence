Theorem
Let $S$ be the set of straight lines in the plane.
For $l_1, l_2 \in S$, let $l_1 \parallel l_2$ denote that $l_1$ is parallel to $l_2$.

Then $\parallel$ is a symmetric relation on $S$.


Proof
Let $l_1 \parallel l_2$.
By definition of parallel lines, $l_1$ does not meet $l_2$ when produced indefinitely.
Hence $l_2$ similarly does not meet $l_1$ when produced indefinitely.
That is:

$l_2 \parallel l_1$
Thus $\parallel$ is seen to be symmetric.
$\blacksquare$

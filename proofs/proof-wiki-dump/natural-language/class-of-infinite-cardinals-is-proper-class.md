Theorem
The class of infinite cardinals $\NN’$ is a proper class.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $\NN'$ is a small class.
By Union of Small Classes is Small, $\NN’ \cup \omega$ is a small class.

By definition of the class of infinite cardinals, $\NN \subseteq \NN' \cup \omega$.
But by Axiom of Subsets Equivalents, this means that $\NN$ is a small class.

This contradicts Class of All Cardinals is Proper Class.
Therefore, $\NN’$ is not a small class.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The second order ODE:

$(1): \quad y + 8 y = 0$
has the general solution:

$y = C_1 \cos 2 \sqrt 2 x + C_2 \sin 2 \sqrt 2 x$


Proof
It can be seen that $(1)$ is a constant coefficient homogeneous linear second order ODE.
Its auxiliary equation is:

$(2): \quad: m^2 + 8 = 0$
From Solution to Quadratic Equation with Real Coefficients, the roots of $(2)$ are:

$m_1 = 2 \sqrt 2 i$
$m_2 = -2 \sqrt 2 i$

These are complex and unequal.
So from Solution of Constant Coefficient Homogeneous LSOODE, the general solution of $(1)$ is:

$y = C_1 \cos 2 \sqrt 2 x + C_2 \sin 2 \sqrt 2 x$
$\blacksquare$

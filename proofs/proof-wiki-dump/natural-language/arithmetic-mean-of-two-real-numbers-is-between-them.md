Theorem
Let $a, b \in \R_{\ne 0}$ be real numbers such that $a < b$.
Let $\map A {a, b}$ denote the arithmetic mean of $a$ and $b$.

Then:

$a < \map A {a, b} < b$


Proof
By definition of arithmetic mean:

$\map A {a, b}Â := \dfrac {a + b} 2$

Thus:














\(\ds a\)

\(<\)







\(\ds b\)





by hypothesis








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 a\)

\(<\)







\(\ds a + b\)





adding $a$ to both sides








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(<\)







\(\ds \dfrac {a + b} 2\)





dividing both sides by $2$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map A {a, b}\)










and:














\(\ds b\)

\(>\)







\(\ds a\)





by hypothesis








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 b\)

\(>\)







\(\ds a + b\)





adding $b$ to both sides








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(>\)







\(\ds \dfrac {a + b} 2\)





dividing both sides by $2$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map A {a, b}\)









Hence the result.

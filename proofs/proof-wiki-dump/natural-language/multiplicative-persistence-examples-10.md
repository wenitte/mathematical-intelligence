Examples of Multiplicative Persistence
$10$ is the smallest positive integer which has a multiplicative persistence of $1$.


Proof
Trivially:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 1 \times 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)









All positive integers less than $10$ are already single digits and so have a multiplicative persistence of $0$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$ be a (strictly) positive integer.
Let $\struct {\map {\MM_\R} n, +, \times}$ denote the ring of square matrices of order $n$ over $\R$.

Then $\struct {\map {\MM_\R} n, +, \times}$ is a ring with unity, but is not a commutative ring.


Proof
Recall that Real Numbers form Field.
The result follows directly from Ring of Square Matrices over Field is Ring with Unity.
$\blacksquare$


Notation
When referring to the operation of matrix multiplication in the context of the ring of square matrices:

$\struct {\map {\MM_R} n, +, \times}$
we must have some symbol to represent it, and $\times$ does as well as any.
However, we do not use $\mathbf A \times \mathbf B$ for matrix multiplication $\mathbf A \mathbf B$, as it is understood to mean the vector cross product, which is something completely different.


Examples
$2 \times 2$ Real Matrices
Let $\struct {\map {\MM_\R} 2, +, \times}$ denote the ring of square matrices of order $2$ over the real numbers $\R$.

Then $\struct {\map {\MM_\R} 2, +, \times}$ forms a ring with unity which is specifically not commutative and also not an integral domain.

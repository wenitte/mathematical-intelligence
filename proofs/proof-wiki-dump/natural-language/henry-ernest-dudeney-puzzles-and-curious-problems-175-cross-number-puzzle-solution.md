Solution



Proof
$4$ across is $1$, $4$ or $9$.
As $28$ down is a $4$-digit number, it follows that $4$ across is $9$ and so $28$ down is $6561$.
Hence $28$ across is constrained to be $625$.
As $36$ across is odd, $33$ across must be $53$ and $36$ across must be $13$.
Hence $14$ down, and hence $18$ across.
This gives $14$ across.
Then $7$ down is a cube ending in $61$, which constrains it to being $9261$.
The last digit of $32$ down is given as $8$.
$39$ across is a fourth power beginning with $1$, constraining it to $1296$.
$37$ down follows.
$6$ times $21$ across is a $3$ digit number.
As $21$ across is square, that means $21$ across is $121$.
$34$ down and $18$ down follow.
$31$ across follows, which alerts us to the fact that $31$ down starts with $0$, which we may not have been expecting.
Hence $32$ down follows.
$23$ across follows, as we have sufficient digits for this.
This of course gives $24$ down as $1$, and its square nature is confirmed.
$21$ down follows, and $27$ across then appears.
$34$ across can be completed.
$35$ down follows.
$41$ across is either $6498$ or $6728$.
As $38$ down is a cube, this means $38$ down is $64$ and $41$ across is $6498$.
$26$ down follows from knowing $18$ across.
$29$ across follows from knowing $18$ across and $31$ across.
$30$ down is constrained, and hence follows $37$ across.
$29$ down follows, which gives us $15$ across (which also follows from $36$ across).
$2$ down is evaluated.
$25$ across is evaluated.
$11$ across is evaluated, which leads to $1$ down.
$12$ down follows.
$3$ down is evaluated.
$1$ across follows.
$17$ across is evaluated.
$20$ down is evaluated.
$6$ down is evaluated.
$9$ down is constrained.
The intersecting digits of $13$ across and $10$ down constrain $13$ across.
$5$ across can be deduced.
$8$ down follows.
The remaining $2$ digits of $8$ across sum to $5$, which constrains $10$ down.
$8$ across then follows.
$4$ down follows.
Finally, $22$ across can be evaluated.

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $353$
The Three Sugar Basins
Three basins each contain the same number of lumps of sugar,
and nine cups are empty.
If we transfer to each cup one-eighteenth of the number of lumps that each basin contains,
we then find that each basin holds $12$ more lumps than each of the cups.
How many lumps are there in each basin before they are removed?


Solution
$36$


Proof
Let $n$ be the number of lumps each basin contains before starting.
Each sugar bowl transfers a total of $9 \times \dfrac n {18} = \dfrac n 2$ lumps to the teacups.
So after this transaction, each sugar bowl contains $n - \dfrac n 2 = \dfrac n 2$ lumps.
Each teacup then contains a total of $3 \times \dfrac n {18} = \dfrac n 6$ lumps.
Hence:

$\dfrac n 2 = \dfrac n 6 + 12$
which after algebra leads us to:

$n = 36$
$\blacksquare$

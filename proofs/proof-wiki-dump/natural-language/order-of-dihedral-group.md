Theorem
The dihedral group $D_n$ is of order $2 n$.


Proof
By definition, $D_n$ is the symmetry group of the regular polygon of $n$ sides.

 
Let $P$ be a regular $n$-gon.

By inspection, it is seen that:

$(1): \quad$ there are $n$ symmetries of the vertices of $P$ by rotation
$(2): \quad$ there are a further $n$ symmetries of the vertices of $P$ by rotation after reflected in any of the axes of bilateral symmetry of $P$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

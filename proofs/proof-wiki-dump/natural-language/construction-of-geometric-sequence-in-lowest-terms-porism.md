Porism to Construction of Geometric Sequence in Lowest Terms
In the words of Euclid:

From this it is manifest that, if three numbers in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them, the extremes of them are squares, and if four numbers, cubes.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VIII}$: Proposition $2$ : Porism)


Proof
Apparent from the construction.
From Construction of Geometric Sequence in Lowest Terms, such a geometric sequence is of the form:

$P = \tuple {q^n, p q^{n - 1}, p^2 q^{n - 2}, \ldots, p^{n - 1} q, p^n}$

Thus when $n = 2$:

$P = \tuple {q^2, p q, p^2}$
and when $n = 3$:

$P = \tuple {q^3, p q^2, p^2 q, p^3}$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $2$ of Book $\text{VIII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

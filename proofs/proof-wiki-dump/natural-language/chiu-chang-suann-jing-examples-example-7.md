Example of Problem from Chiu Chang Suann Jing
A chain suspended from an upright post has a length of $2$ feet lying on the ground,
and on being drawn out to its full length, so as just to touch the ground,
the end is found to be $8$ feet from the post.
What is the length of the chain?


Solution
The chain is $17$ feet long.


Proof
Let the height of the post be $h$.
The length of the chain is then $h + 2$.
When drawn out to its full length, the chain forms the hypotenuse  of a right triangle.
One of the legs of that right triangle is the post, which is $h$ feet long.
The other leg is the distance of the end of the chain from the post, which is $8$ feet.
Hence:














\(\ds \paren {h + 2}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds h^2 + 8^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4 h + 4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 64\)





simplification








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds h\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 15\)





simplification




The right triangle in question here is the $\text{8-15-17}$ triangle.
$\blacksquare$

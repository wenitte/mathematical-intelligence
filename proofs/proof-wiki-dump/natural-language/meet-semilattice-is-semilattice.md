Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a meet semilattice.

Then $\struct {S, \wedge}$ is a semilattice.


Proof
By definition of meet semilattice, $\wedge$ is closed.
The other three defining properties for a semilattice follow respectively from:

Meet is Commutative
Meet is Associative
Meet is Idempotent
Hence $\struct {S, \wedge}$ is a semilattice.
$\blacksquare$

Inspecting the Roads
A man starting from the town $A$, has to inspect throughout all the roads shown from town to town.
Their respective lengths, $13$, $12$, and $5$ miles, are all shown.

What is the shortest route he can adopt, ending his journey wherever he likes?


Solution
The shortest route is $\text {ABCHCDEIEFGBHDIHGIFAG}$.
This traverses all roads once, except $CH$ and $EI$, which are traversed twice.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If from an odd number an even number be subtracted, the remainder will be odd.
(The Elements: Book $\text{IX}$: Proposition $27$)


Proof
Let $a$ be odd and $b$ be even.
Then by definition of odd number:

$\exists c \in \Z: a = 2 c + 1$
and by definition of even number:

$\exists d \in \Z: b = 2 d$
So:














\(\ds a - b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 c + 1 - 2 d\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \paren {c - d} + 1\)









Hence the result by definition of odd number.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $27$ of Book $\text{IX}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

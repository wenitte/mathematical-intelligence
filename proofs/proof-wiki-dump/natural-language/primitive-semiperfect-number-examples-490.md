Example of Primitive Semiperfect Number
$490$ is a primitive semiperfect number:

$2 + 5 + 7 + 14 + 49 + 70 + 98 + 245 = 490$


Proof
First it is demonstrated that $490$ is semiperfect.
The aliquot parts of $490$ are enumerated at $\sigma_0$ of $490$:

$1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, 49, 70, 98, 245$
$490$ is the sum of a subset of its aliquot parts:

$2 + 5 + 7 + 14 + 49 + 70 + 98 + 245 = 490$
Thus $490$ is semiperfect by definition.

By inspecting the divisor sums of each of those aliquot parts, they are seen to be deficient except for $70$.
By Semiperfect Number is not Deficient, none of the deficient aliquot parts are themselves semiperfect.
As for $70$ itself, it is seen to be a weird number.
So, by definition, $70$ is not semiperfect.
Hence the result, by definition of primitive semiperfect number.

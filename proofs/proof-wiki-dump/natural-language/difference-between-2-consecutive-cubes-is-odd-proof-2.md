Theorem
Let $a$ and $b$ be consecutive integers.
Then $b^3 - a^3$ is odd.


Proof
Let $a, b \in \Z$ such that $b = a + 1$.
Either:

$a$ is even and $b$ is odd
or:

$b$ is even and $a$ is odd.
Hence from Parity of Integer equals Parity of Positive Power either:

$a^3$ is even and $b^3$ is odd
or:

$b^3$ is even and $a^3$ is odd.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
There exists at least one example of a completely normal topological space $T$ such that the product space $T \times T$ is not a normal topological space.


Proof
Let $T$ be the Sorgenfrey line.
Let $T' = T \times T$ be Sorgenfrey's half-open square topology.
From Sorgenfrey Line satisfies all Separation Axioms, $T$ is a completely normal space.
From Sorgenfrey's Half-Open Square Topology is Not Normal, $T'$ is not a normal space.
Hence the result.

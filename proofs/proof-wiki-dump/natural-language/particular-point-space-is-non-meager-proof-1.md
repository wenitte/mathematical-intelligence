Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a particular point space.

Then $T$ is non-meager.


Proof
Suppose $T$ were meager.
Then it would be a countable union of subsets which are nowhere dense in $T$.

Let $H \subseteq S$.
From Closure of Open Set of Particular Point Space, the closure of $H$ is $S$.
From the definition of interior, the interior of $S$ is $S$.
So the interior of the closure of $H$ is not empty.
So $T$ can not be the union of a countable set of subsets which are nowhere dense in $T$.
Hence $T$ is not meager and so by definition must be non-meager.

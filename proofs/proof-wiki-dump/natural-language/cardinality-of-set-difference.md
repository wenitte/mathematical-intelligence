Theorem
Let $S$ and $T$ be sets such that $T$ is finite.

Then:

$\card {S \setminus T} = \card S - \card {S \cap T}$
where $\card S$ denotes the cardinality of $S$.


Proof
From Intersection is Subset:

$S \cap T \subseteq S$
$S \cap T \subseteq T$
From Subset of Finite Set is Finite:

$S \cap T$ is finite.

We have:














\(\ds \card {S \setminus T}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \card {S \setminus \paren {S \cap T} }\)





Set Difference with Intersection is Difference














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \card S -  \card {S \cap T}\)





Cardinality of Set Difference with Subset

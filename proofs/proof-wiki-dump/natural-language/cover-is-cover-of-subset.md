Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\CC$ be a cover of $S$.
Let $T \subseteq S$ be a subset of $S$.

Then, $\CC$ is a cover of $T$.


Proof
By definition of a cover:

$\ds S \subseteq \bigcup C$
But then, by Subset Relation is Transitive:

$\ds T \subseteq \bigcup C$
Therefore, $C$ is a cover of $T$ by definition.
$\blacksquare$

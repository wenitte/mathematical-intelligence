Theorem
Let $n \ge 2$ be a natural number.
Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group on $n$ letters.
Let $A_n$ be the alternating group on $n$ letters.

Then the quotient of $S_n$ by $A_n$ is the parity group $C_2$.


Proof
From Alternating Group is Normal Subgroup of Symmetric Group, $A_n$ is a normal subgroup of $S_n$ whose index is $2$.
By definition of index, $\dfrac {S_n} {A_n}$ is a group of order $2$.
The result follows by definition of the parity group.
$\blacksquare$

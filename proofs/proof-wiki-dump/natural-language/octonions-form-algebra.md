This page has been identified as a candidate for refactoring of advanced complexity.In particular: Separate out into its separate partsUntil this has been finished, please leave {{Refactor}} in the code.
New contributors: Refactoring is a task which is expected to be undertaken by experienced editors only.

Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.


Theorem
The set of octonions $\Bbb O$ forms an algebra over the field of real numbers.
This algebra is:

$(1): \quad$ An alternative algebra, but not an associative algebra.
$(2): \quad$ A normed division algebra.
$(3): \quad$ A nicely normed $*$-algebra.


Proof
The octonions $\Bbb O$ are formed by the Cayley-Dickson construction from the quaternions $\Bbb H$.
From Quaternions form Algebra, we have that $\Bbb H$ forms:

$(1): \quad$ An associative algebra
$(2): \quad$ A normed division algebra
$(3): \quad$ A nicely normed $*$-algebra.
From Cayley-Dickson Construction forms Star-Algebra, $\Bbb O$ is a $*$-algebra.
From Cayley-Dickson Construction from Nicely Normed Algebra is Nicely Normed, $\Bbb O$ is a nicely normed $*$-algebra.
From Nicely Normed Cayley-Dickson Construction from Associative Algebra is Alternative, $\Bbb O$ is an alternative algebra.

Now suppose $\Bbb O$ formed an associative algebra.
Then from Cayley-Dickson Construction from Commutative Associative Algebra is Associative, that would mean $\Bbb H$ is a commutative algebra.
But from Quaternions form Algebra it is explicitly demonstrated that $\Bbb H$ is not a commutative algebra.
So $\Bbb O$ cannot be a associative algebra.


Proof of Normed Division Algebra

This needs considerable tedious hard slog to complete it.In particular: Might not need this section. Might find a better way of processing this bit.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Finish}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

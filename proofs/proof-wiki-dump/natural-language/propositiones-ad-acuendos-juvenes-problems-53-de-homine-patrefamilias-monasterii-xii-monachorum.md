Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $53$
De Homine Patrefamilias Monasterii $\text {XII}$ Monachorum
An Abbot with $12$ Monks
An abbot had $12$ monks in his monastery.
Calling his steward he gave him $204$ eggs and ordered that he give equal shares to each monk.
Thus he ordered that he give:
$85$ eggs to the $5$ priests,
and $68$ to the $4$ deacons
and $51$ to the $3$ readers.
How many eggs went to each monk, so that none had too many or too few,
but all received equal portions as above?


Solution
$17$.


Proof
Take the $12$th part of $204$.
This $12$th part is $17$, so $204$ is $12$ times $17$ or $17$ times $12$.
Just as $85$ is $5$ times $17$, so is $68$ four times and $51$ three times.
Now $5$ and $4$ and $3$ are $12$.
There are $12$ men.
Again add $85$ and $68$ and $51$ which is $204$.
There are $204$ eggs.
Therefore to each comes $17$ eggs as the $12$th part.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
It is suggested that this problem has been corrupted.
It feels as though it ought to be a one hundred fowls problem, but the answer is provided as part of the question.
The answer looks as though the scribe is bewilderedly wondering if it be a trick question.
Compare it with Problem $47$: De Episcopo qui Jussit XII Panes in Clero Dividi.

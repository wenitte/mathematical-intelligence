Theorem
Let $\struct{V, \innerprod \cdot \cdot}$ be a real semi-inner product space.

Then $\struct{V, \innerprod \cdot \cdot}$ is a complex semi-inner product Space.

Proof
This follows immediately from:

Definition of Real Semi-Inner Product Space
Definition of Complex Semi-Inner Product Space
Real Semi-Inner Product is Complex Semi-Inner Product
$\blacksquare$

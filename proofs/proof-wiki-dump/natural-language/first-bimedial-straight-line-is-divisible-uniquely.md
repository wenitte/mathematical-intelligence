Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

A first bimedial straight line is divided at one point only.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $43$)


Proof
Let $AB$ be a first bimedial straight line.
Let $AB$ be divided at $C$ to create $AC$ and $CB$ such that:

$AC$ and $CB$ are medial straight lines
$AC$ and $CB$ are commensurable in square only
$AC$ and $CB$ contain a rational rectangle.
Let $AB$ be divided at $D$ such that $AD$ and $DB$ have the same properties as $AB$ and $CB$.
From Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{II} $: Square of Sum:

$AB^2 = \paren {AC + CB}^2 = AC^2 + CB^2 + 2 \cdot AC \cdot CB$
and:

$AB^2 = \paren {AD + DB}^2 = AD^2 + DB^2 + 2 \cdot AD \cdot DB$
and so:

$\paren {AC^2 + CB^2} - \paren {AD^2 + DB^2} = 2 \cdot AD \cdot DB - 2 \cdot AC \cdot CB$
By definition, $AC \cdot CB$ and $AD \cdot DB$ are both rational areas.
So by Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{II} $: Product of Rationally Expressible Numbers is Rational:

$2 AC \cdot CB$ and $2 AD \cdot DB$ are both rational areas.
But $AB$
Thus $2 AC \cdot CB - 2 AD \cdot DB$ is also a rational area.
As:

$AC$ and $CB$ are medial straight lines
and

$AD$ and $DB$ are medial straight lines
it follows by definition that $AC^2$, $CB^2$, $AD^2$ and $DB^2$ are all medial areas.
But from Proposition $26$ of Book $\text{X} $: Medial Area not greater than Medial Area by Rational Area this cannot be the case.

From this contradiction it follows that $D$ cannot divide $AB$ into medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $43$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Example of Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime
$\map {\sigma_1} {58} = 90$
where $\sigma_1$ denotes the divisor sum function.


Proof
We have that:

$58 = 2 \times 29$
and so by definition is a semiprime whose prime factors are distinct.

Hence:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {58}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2 + 1} \paren {29 + 1}\)

\(\ds 3 \times 30\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 90\)

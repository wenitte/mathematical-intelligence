Theorem
Let $X \subset \R$ be a symmetric set of real numbers:

$\forall x \in X: -x \in X$
Let $f: X \to \R$ be an odd function.
Let $g: X \to \R$ be an even function.
Let $f \cdot g$ denote the pointwise product of $f$ and $g$.

Then $\paren {f \cdot g}: X \to \R$ is an odd function.


Proof













\(\ds \map {\paren {f \cdot g} } {-x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {-x} \cdot \map g {-x}\)

\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {-\map f x} \cdot \map g x\)





Definition of Odd Function and Definition of Even Function














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\map f x \cdot \map g x\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\map {\paren {f \cdot g} } x\)

Thus, by definition, $\paren {f \cdot g}$ is an odd function.

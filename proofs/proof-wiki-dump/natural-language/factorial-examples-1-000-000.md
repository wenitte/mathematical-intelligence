Example of Factorial
The factorial of $1 \, 000 \, 000$ has $5 \, 569 \, 709$ digits.


Proof
Let $d$ be the number of digits in $1 \, 000 \, 000!$
From Number of Digits in Factorial:

$d = 1 + \floor {\paren {n + \dfrac 1 2} \log_{10} n - 0.43429 \ 4481 \, n + 0.39908 \ 9934}$
from which the result can be calculated by setting $n = 1 \, 000 \, 000$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The factorial of $1\,000\,000$ was calculated in its entirety by Harry Lewis Nelson and David Slowinski.
The computer printout was $5$ inches high.

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ and $\struct {T, *}$ be algebraic structures.
Let $\phi: \struct {S, \circ} \to \struct {T, *}$ be an isomorphism.

Then $\circ$ is commutative if and only if $*$ is commutative.


Proof
We have that an isomorphism is a homomorphism which is also a bijection.
By definition, an epimorphism is a homomorphism which is also a surjection.
That is, an isomorphism is an epimorphism which is also an injection.
Thus Epimorphism Preserves Commutativity can be applied.

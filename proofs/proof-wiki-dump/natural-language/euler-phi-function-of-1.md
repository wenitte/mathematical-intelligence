Theorem
$\map \phi 1 = 1$
where $\phi$ denotes the Euler $\phi$ function.


Proof
The only (strictly) positive integer less than or equal to $1$ is $1$ itself.
By Integer is Coprime to 1, $1$ is coprime to itself.
Hence, by definition, there is exactly $1$ integer less than or equal to $1$ which is coprime with $1$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

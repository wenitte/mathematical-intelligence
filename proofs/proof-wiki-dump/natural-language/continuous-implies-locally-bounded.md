Theorem
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $M$ be a metric space.
Let $f: X \to M$ be continuous.

Then $f$ is locally bounded.


Proof
Let $x \in X$.
Let $U = \map {f^{-1} } {\map B {\map f x, 1} }$.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: $\map B {\map f x, 1}$You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
By continuity, $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$.
Because $\map f U \subset \map B {\map f x, 1}$, $f$ is bounded on $U$.
Thus $f$ is locally bounded.

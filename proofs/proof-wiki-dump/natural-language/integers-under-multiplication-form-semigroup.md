Theorem
The set of integers under multiplication $\struct {\Z, \times}$ is a semigroup.


Proof
Semigroup Axiom $\text S 0$: Closure
Integer Multiplication is Closed, fulfilling Semigroup Axiom $\text S 0$: Closure.
$\Box$


Semigroup Axiom $\text S 1$: Associativity
Integer Multiplication is Associative, fulfilling Semigroup Axiom $\text S 1$: Associativity.
$\Box$

Hence the semigroup axioms are seen to be fulfilled.
Thus $\struct {\Z, \times}$ is a semigroup.
$\blacksquare$

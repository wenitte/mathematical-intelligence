Theorem
Let $\LL$ be a straight line with a slope which is negative.
Then $\LL$ slopes downward from left to right.


Proof
Let $\LL$ have a slope which is negative.
Expressed in slope-intercept form, $\LL$ can be written:

$y = x \tan \psi + c$
where:

$\psi$ is the angle between $\LL$ and the $x$-axis
$c$  is the $y$-intercept.




By construction:

$90 \degrees < \psi < 180 \degrees$
Hence by Shape of Tangent Function:

$\tan \psi < 0$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

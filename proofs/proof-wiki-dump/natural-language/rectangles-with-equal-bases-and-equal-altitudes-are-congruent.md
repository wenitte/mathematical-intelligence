Theorem
Let $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ be rectangles.
Then $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are congruent if:

the base of $ABCD$ equals the base of $EFGH$
the altitude of $ABCD$ equals the altitude of $EFGH$.


Proof
A rectangle is a parallelogram whose vertices are right angles.
Thus the altitudes of $ABCD$ and of $EFGH$ coincide with the sides of $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ which are adjacent to the bases.
The result then follows from Parallelograms are Congruent if Two Adjacent Sides and Included Angle are respectively Equal.

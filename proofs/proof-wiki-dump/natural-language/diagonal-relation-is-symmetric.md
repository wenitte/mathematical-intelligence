Theorem
The diagonal relation $\Delta_S$ on a set $S$ is a symmetric relation in $S$.


Proof









\(\ds \forall x, y \in S: \, \)



\(\ds \tuple {x, y}\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \Delta_S\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y\)





Definition of Diagonal Relation








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x\)





Equality is Symmetric








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \tuple {y, x}\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \Delta_S\)





Definition of Diagonal Relation



So $\Delta_S$ is symmetric.

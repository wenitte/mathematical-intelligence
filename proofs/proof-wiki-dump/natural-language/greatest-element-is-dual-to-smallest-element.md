Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $a \in S$.

The following are dual statements:

$a$ is the greatest element of $S$
$a$ is the smallest element of $S$


Proof
By definition, $a$ is the greatest element of $S$ if and only if:

$\forall b \in S: b \preceq a$
The dual of this statement is:

$\forall b \in S: a \preceq b$
by Dual Pairs (Order Theory).

By definition, this means $a$ is the smallest element of $S$.

The converse follows from Dual of Dual Statement (Order Theory).
$\blacksquare$

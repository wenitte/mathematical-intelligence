Lemma
$\paren {\pm a}^2 = \paren {\pm b}^2 = \paren {\pm c}^2 = -1$


Proof
Without loss of generality, $a$ is checked.
The proofs for other $5$ elements are similar.














\(\ds \paren {a^2}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^4\)

Definition of Order of Group Element



So $a^2 = 1$ or $a^2 = -1$.
As the order of $a = 4$:

$a^2 \ne 1$
Hence:

$a^2 = -1$
as required.
$\blacksquare$

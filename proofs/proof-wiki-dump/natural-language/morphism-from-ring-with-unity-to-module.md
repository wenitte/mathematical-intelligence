Theorem
Let $R$ be a ring with unity.
Let $M$ be an $R$-module.
Then for every $m \in M$ there exists a unique $R$-module morphism:

$\psi: R \to M$
that sends $1$ to $m$.


Proof
Existence
Let $r \in R$.
Let $\map \psi rÂ := r m$.
This map is $R$-linear by definition of a module.
$\Box$


Uniqueness
Let $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ be two such morphisms.
Then $\psi_1 - \psi_2$ is an $R$-module morphism whose kernel contains $1$.
Thus:

$\map \ker {\psi_1 - \psi_2} = R$
and:

$\psi_1 = \psi_2$
$\blacksquare$

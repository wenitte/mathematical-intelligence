Theorem
Let $x, y \in \Z$ be integers with $x + y \ne 0$.
Let $n \ge 1$ be an odd natural number.
Let:

$2 \divides x + y$
where $\divides$ denotes divisibility.

Then:

$\map {\nu_2} {x^n + y^n} = \map {\nu_2} {x + y}$
where $\nu_2$ denotes $2$-adic valuation.


Proof
This follows from the Lifting The Exponent Lemma for p=2 with $y$ replaced by $-y$.
$\blacksquare$

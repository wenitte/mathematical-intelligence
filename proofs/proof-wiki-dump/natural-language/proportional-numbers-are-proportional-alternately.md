Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If four numbers be proportional, they will also be proportional alternately.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VII}$: Proposition $13$)


Proof
Let the four (natural) numbers $A, B, C, D$ be proportional so that $A : B = C : D$.
We need to show that $A : C = B : D$.


We have that $A : B = C : D$.
So from Book $\text{VII}$ Definition $20$: Proportional we have that whatever aliquot part or aliquant part $A$ is of $B$, the same aliquot part or aliquant part is $C$ of $D$.
So from Proposition $10$ of Book $\text{VII} $: Multiples of Alternate Ratios of Equal Fractions, whatever aliquot part or aliquant part $A$ is of $C$, the same aliquot part or aliquant part is $B$ of $D$.
Therefore from Book $\text{VII}$ Definition $20$: Proportional $A : C = B : D$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $13$ of Book $\text{VII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

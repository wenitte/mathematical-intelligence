Examples of Use of Intersection of Sets of Integer Multiples
Let $m \Z$ denote the set of integer multiples of $m$.
Then:

$6 \Z \cap 15 \Z = 30 \Z$


Proof
From Intersection of Sets of Integer Multiples

$6 \Z \cap 15 \Z = \lcm \set {6, 15} \Z$
From Lowest Common Multiple of $6$ and $15$:

$\lcm \set {6, 15} = 30$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

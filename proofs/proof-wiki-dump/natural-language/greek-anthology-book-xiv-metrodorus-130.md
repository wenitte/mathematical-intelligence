Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
Of the four spouts one filled the whole tank in a day,
the second in two days,
the third in three days,
and the fourth in four days.
What time will all four take to fill it?


Solution
Let $t$ be the number of days it takes to fill the tank.
Let $a, b, c, d$ be the flow rate in numbers of tanks per day of (respectively) the first, second, third and fourth spouts.

In $t$ days, the various contributions of each of the spouts is $a t$, $b t$, $c t$ and $d t$ respectively.
So for the total contribution to be $1$ tank, we have:















\(\ds \paren {a + b + c + d} t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {a + b + c + d}\)










We have:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)





that is, $1$ tank in $1$ day














\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 2\)





that is, $1$ tank in $2$ days














\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 3\)





that is, $1$ tank in $3$ days














\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 4\)





that is, $1$ tank in $4$ days




and so:














\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {a + b + c + d}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {1 + \dfrac 1 2 + \dfrac 1 3 + \dfrac 1 4}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12} {12 + 6 + 4 + 3}\)





multiplying top and bottom by $12$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12} {25}\)









So the tank will be filled in $\dfrac {12} {25}$ of a day.
$\blacksquare$

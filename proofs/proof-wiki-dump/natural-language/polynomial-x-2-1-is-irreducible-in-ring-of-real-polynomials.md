Theorem
Let $\R \sqbrk X$ be the ring of polynomials in $X$ over the real numbers $\R$.

Then the polynomial $X^2 + 1$ is an irreducible element of $\R \sqbrk X$.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $x^2 + 1$ has a non-trivial factorization in $\R \sqbrk X$.
Then:

$\exists \alpha, \beta \in \R: \paren {X - \alpha} \paren {X - \beta}$
and from the Polynomial Factor Theorem:

$\alpha^2 + 1 = 0$

But that means:

$\alpha^2 = -1$
and such an $\alpha$ does not exist in $\R$.
Hence the result by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

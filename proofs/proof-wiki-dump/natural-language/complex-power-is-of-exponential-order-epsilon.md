Theorem
Let: 

$f: \hointr 0 \to \to \C: t \mapsto t^\phi$
be $t$ to the power of $\phi$, for $\phi \in \C$, defined on its principal branch.
Let $\map \Re \phi > -1$.

Then $f$ is of exponential order $\epsilon$ for any  $\epsilon > 0$ arbitrarily small in magnitude. 


Proof













\(\ds \size {t^\phi}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t^{\map \Re \phi}\)





Modulus of Positive Real Number to Complex Power is Positive Real Number to Power of Real Part



The result follows from Real Power is of Exponential Order Epsilon.
$\blacksquare$

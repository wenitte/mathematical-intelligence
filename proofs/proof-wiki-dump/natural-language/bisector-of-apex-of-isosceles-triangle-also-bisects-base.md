Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be an isosceles triangle whose apex is $A$.
Let $AD$ be the bisector of $\angle BAC$ such that $AD$ intersects $BC$ at $D$.

Then $AD$ bisects $BC$.


Proof
By definition of isosceles triangle, $AB = AC$.
By definition of bisector, $\angle BAD = \angle CAD$.
By construction, $AD$ is common.
Thus by Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence, $\triangle ABD = \triangle ACD$.
Thus $AD = DC$.
The result follows by definition of bisection.
$\blacksquare$

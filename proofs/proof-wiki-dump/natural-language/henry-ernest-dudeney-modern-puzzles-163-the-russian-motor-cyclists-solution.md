Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $163$
The Russian Motor-Cyclists
Two Russian Army motor-cyclists, on the road $A$, wish to go to $B$.
Now Pyotr said: "I shall go to $D$, which is $6$ miles, and then take the straight road to $B$, another $15$ miles.
But Sergei thought he would try the upper road by way of $C$.
Curiously enough, they found on reference to their odometers that the distance either way was exactly the same.

This being so, they ought to have been able easily to answer the General's simple question,
"How far is it from $A$ to $C$?"
it can be done in the head in a few moments, if you only know how.
Can the reader state correctly the distance?


Solution
$3 \tfrac 1 3$ miles.

The "pretty little rule" as Dudeney so patronisingly puts it is applied thus:

... divide $15$ by $6$ and add $2$, which gives us $4 \tfrac 1 2$.
Now divide $15$ by $4 \tfrac 1 2$, and the result $3 \tfrac 1 3$ miles) is the required distance between the two points.

Thus if $a + x$ and $b$ are the legs of the right triangle:

$x = \dfrac b {\dfrac b a + 2}$
which is actually a pretty unwieldy little rule considering how rarely one would end up using it.


Proof
Let $x$ miles be the distance from $A$ to $C$.
Let $y$ miles be the distance from $C$ to $B$.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \paren {x + 6}^2 + 15^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds x + y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 + 15\)





... the distance either way was exactly the same.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 + 12 x + 36 + 225\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {21 - x}^2\)





multiplying out and substituting for $y$ from $(2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 54 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 180\)





more simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {10} 3\)





more simplifying




The general case can be explored as:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \paren {a + x}^2 + b^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\paren {a + b} - x}^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^2 + 2 a x + x^2 + b^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a + b}^2 - 2 \paren {a + b} x + x^2\)





multiplying out








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^2 + 2 a x + x^2 + b^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2 + 2 a b + b^2 - 2 a x - 2 b x + x^2\)





more multiplying out








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {2 a + b} x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a b\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {a b} {2 a + b}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac b {2 + b / a}\)









as we were to show.

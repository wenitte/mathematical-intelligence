Theorem
Let $a, b, c \in \Z_{>0}$.
Then:

$b = \dfrac 1 c \times a \implies c \divides a$
where $\divides$ denotes divisibilty.

In the words of Euclid:

If a number have any part whatever, it will be measured by a number called by the same name as the part.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VII}$: Proposition $38$)


Proof
Let $a$ have an aliquot part $b$.
Let $c$ be an integer called by the same name as the aliquot part $b$.
Then:

$1 = \dfrac 1 c \times c$
and so by Proposition $15$ of Book $\text{VII} $: Alternate Ratios of Multiples:

$ 1 : c = b : a$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $38$ of Book $\text{VII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

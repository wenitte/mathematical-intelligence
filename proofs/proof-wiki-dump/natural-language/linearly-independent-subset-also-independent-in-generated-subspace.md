Theorem
Let $G$ be a finitely generated $K$-vector space.
Let $S$ be a linearly independent subset of $G$.
Let $M$ be the subspace of $G$ generated by $S$.

If $M \ne G$, then $\forall b \in G: b \notin M$, the set $S \cup \set b$ is linearly independent.


Proof
Suppose that:

$\ds \sum_{k \mathop = 1}^n \lambda_k x_k + \lambda b = 0$
where $\sequence {x_n}$ is a sequence of distinct vectors of $S$.
If $\lambda \ne 0$, then $\ds b = -\lambda^{-1} \paren {\sum_{k \mathop = 1}^n \lambda_k x_k} \in M$ which contradicts the definition of $b$.
Hence $\lambda = 0$, and so:

$\ds \sum_{k \mathop = 1}^n \lambda_k x_k = 0$
Therefore $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_n = \lambda = 0$ as $S$ is linearly independent.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group whose identity is $e$.
Let $*$ be the group action of $\struct {G, \circ}$ on itself by the rule:

$\forall g, h \in G: g * h = g \circ h$

Then the orbit of an element $x \in G$ is given by:

$\Orb x = G$


Proof
Let $y \in G$.
Then:










\(\ds \exists g \in G: \, \)



\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds g \circ x\)





Group has Latin Square Property








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \Orb x\)





Definition of Orbit



Hence the result.

Theorem
Let $ABC$ be a triangle.
Then the perimeter $P$ of $ABC$ is given by:

$P = a + b + c$
where $a, b, c$ are the lengths of the sides of $ABC$.


Proof
The perimeter of a plane geometric figure is defined as the total length of the boundary.
By definition, the boundary of a triangle comprises the three sides of that triangle.
Hence the result.

Theorem
The modulus of a complex number equals its distance from the origin on the complex plane.


Proof
Let $z = x + y i$ be a complex number and $O = 0 + 0 i$ be the origin on the complex plane.

We have its modulus:














\(\ds \cmod z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cmod {x + y i}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {x^2 + y^2}\)





Definition of Complex Modulus




and its distance from the origin on the complex plane:














\(\ds \map d {z, O}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map d {\tuple {x, y}, \tuple {0, 0} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {\paren {x - 0}^2 + \paren {y - 0}^2}\)





Distance Formula














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {x^2 + y^2}\)










The two are seen to be equal.

A specific link is needed here.In particular: There may be a more directly relevant link to the distance formula based on the fact (which we've proved somewhere) that the complex plane is a metric space, and that the distance formula is that metric.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by searching for it, and adding it here.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{LinkWanted}} from the code.

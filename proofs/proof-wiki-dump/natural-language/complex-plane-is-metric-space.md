Theorem
Let $\C$ be the set of all complex numbers.
Let $d: \C \times \C \to \R$ be the function defined as:

$\map d {z_1, z_2} = \size {z_1 - z_2}$
where $\size z$ is the modulus of $z$.
Then $d$ is a metric on $\C$ and so $\struct {\C, d}$ is a metric space.


Proof
Let $z_1 = x_1 + i y_1, z_2 = x_2 + i y_2$.
From the definition of modulus:

$\size {z_1 - z_2} = \sqrt {\paren {x_1 - x_2}^2 + \paren {y_1 - y_2}^2}$
This is the euclidean metric on the real number plane.
This is shown in Euclidean Metric on Real Vector Space is Metric to be a metric.
Thus the complex plane is a 2-dimensional Euclidean space.

Theorem
$\paren {A \cap B} \setminus C = \paren {A \setminus C} \cap \paren {B \setminus C}$


Proof
Demonstration by Venn diagram:

 
Consider the diagram on the left hand side.
The red and yellow areas together form $A \cap B$.
The red area without the yellow area forms $\paren {A \cap B} \setminus C$.

Consider the diagram on the right hand side.
The red and orange areas together form $A \setminus C$.
The yellow and orange areas together form $B \setminus C$.
Their intersection is the orange area, which forms $\paren {A \setminus C} \cap \paren {B \setminus C}$.

It is seen that the red area on the left hand side is the same as the orange area on the right hand side.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct{R, \norm {\,\cdot\,} }$ be a normed division ring.
Let $d$ be the metric induced by the norm $\norm {\,\cdot\,}$.

Let $a \in R$.
Let $\epsilon \in \R_{>0}$ be a strictly positive real number.

Let $\map {{B_\epsilon}^-} {a; \norm {\,\cdot\,} }$ denote the closed ball in the normed division ring $\struct {R, \norm {\,\cdot\,} }$.
Let $\map {{B_\epsilon}^-} {a; d }$ denote the closed ball in the metric space $\struct {R, d}$.

Then:

$\map {{B_\epsilon}^-} {a; \norm {\,\cdot\,} }$ = $\map {{B_\epsilon}^-} {a; d }$

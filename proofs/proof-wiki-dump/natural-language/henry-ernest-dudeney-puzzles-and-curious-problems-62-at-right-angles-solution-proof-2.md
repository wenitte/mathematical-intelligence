Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $62$
At Right Angles
How soon between the hours of five and six will the hour and minute hands of a clock be exactly at right angles?


Solution
$10 \tfrac {10} {11}$ past $5$.



Proof
From Time when Hour Hand and Minute Hand at Right Angle, the times when this is between $5$ and $6$ are:

$05:10:55$
and:

$05:43:38$
The first of these is the earlier of those two times.
$\blacksquare$

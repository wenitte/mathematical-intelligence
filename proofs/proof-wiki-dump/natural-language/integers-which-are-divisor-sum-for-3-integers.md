Theorem
The sequence of integers which are the divisor sum of $3$ different integers begins:

$24, 42, 48, 60, 84, 90, \ldots$
This sequence is A007372 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (N. J. A. Sloane (Ed.), 2008).


Proof
For a given $n$, to determine every $m$ such that $\map {\sigma_1} m = n$ can be determined by evaluating the divisor sum of all integers up to $n - 1$.

It is hence noted:

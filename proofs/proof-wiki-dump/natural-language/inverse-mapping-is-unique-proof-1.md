Theorem
Let $f: S \to T$ be a mapping.
If $f$ has an inverse mapping, then that inverse mapping is unique.

That is, if:

$f$ and $g$ are inverse mappings of each other
and

$f$ and $h$ are inverse mappings of each other
then $g = h$.


Proof
By the definition of inverse mapping:














\(\ds g \circ f\)

\(=\)







\(\ds I_S\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds h \circ f\)









and:














\(\ds f \circ g\)

\(=\)







\(\ds I_T\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds f \circ h\)









So:














\(\ds h\)

\(=\)







\(\ds h \circ I_T\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds h \circ \paren {f \circ g}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {h \circ f} \circ g\)





Composition of Mappings is Associative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds I_S \circ g\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds g\)









So $g = h$ and the inverse is unique.

Theorem
Holomorphic 1-forms are closed. 

Proof
Let $\omega$ be a holomorphic 1-form.
By wedge product of differential forms is antisymmetric

$\rd z \wedge\rd z=0$
By Cauchy-Riemann Equations

$\frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar{z}}=0$
Then:

$
\rd \omega=\rd(f(z)\rd z)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\rd z \wedge\rd z+\frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar{z}}\rd \bar{z} \wedge\rd z=0+0=0
$
so $\omega$ is closed. 
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\CC$ be a circle.
Let $P$ and $Q$ be conjugate points with respect to $\CC$.
Let $A$ and $B$ be the points of intersection of $PQ$ with $\CC$.

Then $A$ and $B$ are harmonic conjugates with respect to $P$ and $Q$.


Proof
By definition of conjugate points, the polar of $P$ passes through $Q$.
Hence by Harmonic Property of Pole and Polar wrt Circle, $A$ and $B$ are harmonic conjugates with respect to $P$ and $Q$.
$\blacksquare$

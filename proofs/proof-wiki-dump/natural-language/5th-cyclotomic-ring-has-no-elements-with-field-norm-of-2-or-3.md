Theorem
Let $\struct {\Z \sqbrk {i \sqrt 5}, +, \times}$ denote the $5$th cyclotomic ring.

There are no elements of $\struct {\Z \sqbrk {i \sqrt 5}, +, \times}$ whose field norm is either $2$ or $3$.


Proof
Let $\map N z$ denote the field norm of $z \in \Z \sqbrk {i \sqrt 5}$.
Let $z = x + i y$.
Then:














\(\ds \map N z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 + 5 y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)





Field Norm on 5th Cyclotomic Ring








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)





as $y$ is an integer and has to equal $0$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt 2\)









But Square Root of Prime is Irrational so $x \notin \Z$.
Similarly for $\map N z = 3$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {X, \Sigma}$ be a measurable space.
Let $\mu$ be a measure on $\struct {X, \Sigma}$. 
Let $\nu$ be a finite signed measure on $\struct {X, \Sigma}$. 

Then there exist finite signed measures $\nu_a$ and $\nu_s$ on $\struct {X, \Sigma}$ such that: 

$(1): \quad \nu_a$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$
$(2): \quad \nu_s$ and $\mu$ are mutually singular
$(3): \quad \nu = \nu_a + \nu_s$


Proof
This follows immediately from Finite Signed Measure is Complex Measure.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is arc-connected.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $T$ is also locally arc-connected.


Proof
Let $T$ be the extended topologist's sine curve.
From Extended Topologist's Sine Curve is Arc-Connected, $T$ is an arc-connected space.
From Extended Topologist's Sine Curve is not Locally Arc-Connected, $T$ is not a locally arc-connected space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

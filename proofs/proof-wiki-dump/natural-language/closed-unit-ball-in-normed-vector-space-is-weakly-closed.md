Theorem
Let $\GF \in \set {\R, \C}$. 
Let $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a normed vector space over $\GF$.
Let $B^-$ be the closed unit ball in $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$.

Then $B^-$ is weakly closed.


Proof
From Closed Unit Ball is Convex Set, $B^-$ is convex.
From Closed Ball is Closed, $B^-$ is $\norm {\, \cdot \,}$-closed. 
From Mazur's Theorem: Corollary, we can conclude that $B^-$ is weakly closed.
$\blacksquare$

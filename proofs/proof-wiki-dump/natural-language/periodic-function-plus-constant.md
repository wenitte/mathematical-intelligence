Theorem
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be a real function.
Let $k \in \R$ be constant.

Then $f$ is periodic with period $L$ if and only if $f + k$ is periodic with period $L$.


Proof
Sufficient Condition
Let $f$ be periodic with period $L$.
Then:














\(\ds \map f x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {x + L}\)





Definition of Periodic Real Function








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map f x + k\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {x + L} + k\)









Thus $f + k$ has been shown to be periodic with period $L$.
$\Box$


Necessary Condition
Let $f + k$ be periodic with period $L$.
Then:














\(\ds \map f x + k\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {x + L} + k\)





Definition of Periodic Real Function








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map f x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {x + L}\)









Thus $f$ has been shown to be periodic with period $L$.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $P$ be a path component of $T$.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $P$ is also an arc component of $T$.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a finite particular point space.
From Particular Point Space is Path-Connected, $T$ is path-connected.
Therefore $S$ is a path component in $T$.
But from Particular Point Space is not Arc-Connected, $T$ is not arc-connected.
Therefore $S$ is not an arc component in $T$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

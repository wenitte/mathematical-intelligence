Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\BB$ be a synthetic basis on $S$.
Let $\tau$ be the topology on $S$ generated by the synthetic basis $\BB$:

$\ds \tau = \set {\bigcup \AA: \AA \subseteq \BB}$

Then:

$\forall U \subseteq S: U \in \tau \iff \forall x \in U: \exists B \in \BB: x \in B \subseteq U$


Proof
From Set is Subset of Union: General Result, the forward implication directly follows.

We now show that the reverse implication holds.
By hypothesis, we have that:

$\ds U \subseteq \bigcup \set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U}$
By Union is Smallest Superset: General Result:

$\ds \bigcup \set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U} \subseteq U$

By definition of set equality:

$\ds U = \bigcup \set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U}$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

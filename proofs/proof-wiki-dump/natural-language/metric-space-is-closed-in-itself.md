Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space.

Then $A$ is closed in $M$.


Proof
From Empty Set is Open in Metric Space, $\O$ is open in $M$.
But:

$A = \relcomp A \O$
where $\complement_A$ denotes the set complement relative to $A$.
The result follows by definition of closed set.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $x$ be an ordinal.

Then $x$ is a finite set if and only if $x$ is an element of the minimally inductive set.


Proof
$x$ is finite if and only if $x \sim \N_n$ for some $n \in \N$, by definition.

But $x$ is an ordinal, and by definition, it is equal to its initial segment.
By definition of the von Neumann construction of natural numbers, it follows that $x \sim n$ for some $n$.
By Finite Ordinal is equal to Natural Number, it follows that $x$ is equal to $n$.
Thus, $x$ is an element of the minimally inductive set.
$\blacksquare$

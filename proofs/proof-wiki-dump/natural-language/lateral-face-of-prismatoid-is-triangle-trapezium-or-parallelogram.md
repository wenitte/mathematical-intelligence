Theorem
Let $\PP$ be a prismatoid.
Let $\FF$ be a lateral face of $\PP$.
Then $\FF$ is one of the following:

a triangle
a trapezium
a parallelogram.


Proof
We have that an antiprism is a priori a prismatoid.
The lateral faces of an antiprism are triangles.

We have that an oblique prism is a priori a prismatoid.
The lateral faces of an oblique prism are parallelograms.

Suppose that $\FF$ were a polygon with more than $4$ sides.
Then at least $2$ of those adjacent sides, $S$ and $T$ say, are also sides of $\FF$.
But as $S$ and $T$ are not in the same plane as the lateral edges that form the other sides of $\FF$, they cannot form a polygon.
So the lateral faces can have no more than $4$ sides.

So, let $A$ and $B$ be the bases of $\PP$.
They are parallel by definition.
Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be sides of $A$ and $B$ respectively which form the sides of one of the lateral faces $\FF$ of $\PP$.
Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be such that they are not of the same length.
Then $\FF$ is a quadrilateral which has $2$ unequal sides parallel.
Hence by definition it is a trapezium.

Problem
Consider the corner of a room which is separated from the rest of the room by a screen of two identical halves, $a$ and $b$ where the length of $a$ equals the length of $b$.
The screen meets the walls of the room at $A$ and $B$.




How can the screen be arranged so that the area enclosed by the screen is a maximum?


Solution
When the screen forms two sides of a regular octagon:



Thus the sides of the screen must make an angle of $67 \frac 1 2 \degrees$ with the walls.


Proof
When the area enclosed by the screen is a maximum, so will be the area of the octagon so formed by the construction above.


This needs considerable tedious hard slog to complete it.In particular: Invoke (and first create) the result about maximising the area of a polygonTo discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Finish}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
The angles the screen makes with the walls is half the internal angle of the regular octagon.
From Internal Angles of Regular Polygon, that is:

$A = \dfrac 1 2 \paren {\dfrac {\paren {n - 2} 180 \degrees} n}$
where:

$A$ is the angle the screen makes with the wall
$n$ is the number of sides of the regular polygon, in this case $8$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
On all the number systems:

natural numbers $\N$
integers $\Z$
rational numbers $\Q$
real numbers $\R$
complex numbers $\C$
there exists no zero element for addition.


Proof
Suppose $z$ is a zero element for addition in a standard number system $\F$.
Then:










\(\ds \forall n \in \F: \, \)



\(\ds n + z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds z\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





subtracting $z$ from both sides



As $n$ is arbitrary, and therefore not always $0$, it follows there can be no such $z$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $M = \struct {S, \mathscr I}$ be a matroid.
Let $B \subseteq S$ be a base of $M$.
Let $X \subseteq S$ be any independent subset of $M$.

Then:

$\card X \le \card B$


Proof
From Independent Subset is Contained in Maximal Independent Subset :

$\exists B' \subseteq SÂ : X \subseteq B'$ and $B'$ is a maximal independent subset of $S$
By definition of a base:

$B'$ is a base of $M$
From Cardinality of Subset of Finite Set:

$\card X \le \card {B'}$
From All Bases of Matroid have same Cardinality:

$\card{B'} = \card B$
Hence:

$\card X \le \card B$
$\blacksquare$

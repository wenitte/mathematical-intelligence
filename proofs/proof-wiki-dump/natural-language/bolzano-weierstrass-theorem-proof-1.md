Theorem
Every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.


Proof
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a bounded sequence in $\R$.
By the Peak Point Lemma, $\sequence {x_n}$ has a monotone subsequence $\sequence {x_{n_r} }$.
Since $\sequence {x_n}$ is bounded, so is $\sequence {x_{n_r} }$.
Hence, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem (Real Analysis), the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
If at least one set exists, then there exists an empty set.

Let $S$ be a set.
By the axiom of class comprehension, there is an empty class:

$\O = \set { x : x \ne x }$
Since $x \in \O$ is never true, it follows vacuously that:

$x \in \O \implies x \in S$
By the subclass definition:

$\O \subseteq S$
By Subclass of Set is Set, $\O$ is a set.
$\blacksquare$

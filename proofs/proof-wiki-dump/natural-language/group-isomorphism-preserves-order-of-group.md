Theorem
Let $G$ and $H$ be groups.
Let $\phi: G \to H$ be a (group) isomorphism.

Then:

$\order G = \order H$
where $\order {\, \cdot \,}$ denotes the order of a group.


Proof
By definition, an isomorphism is a bijection.
By definition, the order of a group is the cardinality of its underlying set.
The result follows by definition of set equivalence.

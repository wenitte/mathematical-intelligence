Theorem
Let $S$ be a set such that $S \sim x$ for some ordinal $x$.
Let $\card S$ denote the cardinality of $S$.

Then:

$\card S \in \On$
where $\On$ denotes the class of all ordinals.


Proof
If $S \sim x$, then $\set {x \in \On: S \sim x}$ is a non-empty set of ordinals.
It follows that this set has a minimal element, its intersection.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Needs a link to the fact that $\set {x \in \On: S \sim x}$ is the subset of a well-ordered set, and also that the intersection is that minimal element.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.

This minimal element is the cardinal number of $S$, by the definition of cardinal number.

Thus, it is an ordinal.

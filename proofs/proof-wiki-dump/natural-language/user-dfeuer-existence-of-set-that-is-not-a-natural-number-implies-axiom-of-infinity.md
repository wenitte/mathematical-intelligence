Theorem
Suppose there is a set $x$ such that $x$ is not a User:Dfeuer/Definition:Natural Number.

Then the User:Dfeuer/Axiom of Infinity holds. That is, the class $\omega$ of natural numbers is a set.


Proof
Since $x$ is not a natural number, there is an inductive set $a$ such that $x \notin a$.
Thus by User:Dfeuer/Existence of Inductive Set implies Axiom of Infinity, the User:Dfeuer/Axiom of Infinity holds.
$\blacksquare$

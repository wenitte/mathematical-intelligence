Corollary to Group has Latin Square Property
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $a, b, c \in G$.

Then the following hold:

Right cancellation law
$b a = c a \implies b = c$
Left cancellation law
$a b = a c \implies b = c$


Proof
Suppose $x = b a = c a$.
By Group has Latin Square Property, there exists exactly one $y \in G$ such that $x = y a$.
That is, $x = b a = c a \implies b = c$.

Similarly, suppose $x = a b = a c$.
Again by Group has Latin Square Property, there exists exactly one $y \in G$ such that $x = a y$.
That is, $a b = a c \implies b = c$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $T$ be a singleton.

Then there exists a unique mapping $S \to T$.


Proof
Let $T = \set t$.
Let $f$ and $g$ both be mappings from $S$ to $T$.
From Mapping is Constant iff Image is Singleton:

$\forall s \in S: \map f s = t$
and:

$\forall s \in S: \map g s = t$
The result follows by Equality of Mappings.
$\blacksquare$

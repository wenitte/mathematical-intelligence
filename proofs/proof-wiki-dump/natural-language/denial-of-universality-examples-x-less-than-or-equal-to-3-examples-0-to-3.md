Example of Denial of Universality: $\forall x \in S: x \le 3$
Let $P$ be the statement:

$\forall x \in S: x \le 3$
and $\lnot P$ its negation:

$\exists x \in S: x > 3$

Let $S = \closedint 0 3$ where $\closedint \cdot \cdot$ denotes a closed real interval.
Then we have that:

$P$ is true
and consequently:

$\lnot P$ is false


Proof
By definition of closed real interval:

$\forall x \in S: 0 \le x \le 3$
and so:

$\forall x \in S: x \le 3$
Hence its negation is false.
$\blacksquare$

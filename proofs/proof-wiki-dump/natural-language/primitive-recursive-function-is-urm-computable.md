Theorem
Every primitive recursive function‎ is URM computable.


Proof
This follows immediately from:

The fact that the basic primitive recursive functions are URM computable;
Functions obtained by substitution from URM computable functions are URM computable;
Functions obtained by primitive recursion from URM computable functions are URM computable;
The definition of primitive recursive function‎.
$\blacksquare$


Note
This does not mean that every URM computable function is necessarily primitive recursive.

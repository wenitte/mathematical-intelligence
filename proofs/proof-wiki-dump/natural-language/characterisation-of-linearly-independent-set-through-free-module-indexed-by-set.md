Theorem
Let $M$ be a unitary $R$-module.
Let $S = \family {m_i}_{i \mathop \in I}$ be a family of elements of $M$.
Let $\PsiÂ : R^{\paren I} \to M$ be the module homomorphism given by Universal Property of Free Module on Set.

Then the following are equivalent:

$S$ linearly independent
$\Psi$ is injective.


Proof
We have:

$\map \Psi {\family {r_i}_{i \mathop \in I} } = 0$
if and only if:

$\ds \sum_{i \mathop \in I} r_i m_i = 0$

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Justify the above statement.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Thus  injectivity and linearly independent are equivalent.

Theorem
Let $S$ be a substance with molecular weight $W_S$.

Then one mole of $S$ has a mass of $W_S$ grams.


Proof
Let $m_S$ grams be the mean mass of one molecule of $S$.
Let $m_C$ grams be the mass of one atom of carbon-12.

Let $M_S$ grams be the mass of one mole of $S$.
Let $M_C$ grams be the mass of one mole of carbon-12.

Then:














\(\ds W_S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m_S \times \dfrac {12} {m_C}\)





Definition of Molecular Weight














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds M_S \times \dfrac {12} {M_C}\)










\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds M_S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds W_S \times \dfrac {M_C} {12}\)










Before $2018$, the mole was defined as the number of atoms in $12$ grams of carbon-12.
While the mole is no longer so defined, the mass of $1$ mole of carbon-12 is still $12$ grams, for all practical purposes.
Thus we have:














\(\ds M_C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12 \ \mathrm g\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds M_S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds W_S \dfrac {12 \ \mathrm g} {12}\)





substituting for $M_C$ in $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds M_S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds W_S \ \mathrm g\)

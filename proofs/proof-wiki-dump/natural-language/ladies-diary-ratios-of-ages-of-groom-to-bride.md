Puzzle
A person remarked that upon his wedding day the proportion of his own age to that of his bride was $3$ to $1$,
but $15$ years afterwards the proportion of their ages was $2$ to $1$.
What were their ages upon the day of their marriage?


Solution
The bride was $15$ and the groom was $45$ when they married.
Outrageous.


Proof
Let $x$ and $y$ be the ages of the bride and groom at their marriage respectively.
We have:














\(\ds 3 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y\)




















\(\ds 2 \paren {x + 15}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y + 15\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 x + 30\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 x + 15\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 15\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 45\)









$\blacksquare$

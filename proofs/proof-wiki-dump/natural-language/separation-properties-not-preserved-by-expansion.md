Theorem
These separation properties are not generally preserved under expansion:

$T_3$ Space
Regular Space
$T_4$ Space
Completely Regular Space
$T_5$ Space
Normal Space
Completely Normal Space


Proof
Let $\struct {\R, \tau_1}$ be the set of real numbers under the usual (Euclidean) topology.
Let $\struct {\R, \tau_2}$ be the indiscrete rational extension of $\struct {\R, \tau_1}$.

From Metric Space fulfils all Separation Axioms, $\struct {\R, \tau_1}$ is:

$T_3$ Space
Regular Space
$T_4$ Space
Completely Regular Space
$T_5$ Space
Normal Space
Completely Normal Space

But we have:

Indiscrete Rational Extension of Real Number Line is not $T_3$ Space
Indiscrete Rational Extension of Real Number Line is not $T_4$ Space
Indiscrete Rational Extension of Real Number Line is not $T_5$ Space

By definition, $\struct {\R, \tau_2}$ is an expansion of $\struct {\R, \tau_1}$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

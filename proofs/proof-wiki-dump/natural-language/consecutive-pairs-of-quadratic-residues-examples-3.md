Examples of Consecutive Pairs of Quadratic Residues
There are no Consecutive Pairs of Quadratic Residues modulo $3$.
This is consistent with the number of such consecutive pairs being $\floor {\dfrac 3 4}$.


Proof
From Quadratic Residues modulo $3$:

$1$ is a quadratic residue
$2$ is not a quadratic residue.
Hence neither is an element of a pair of consecutive quadratic residues.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S = \set s$ be a singleton.
Let $\RR$ be an ordering on $S$.

Then $\RR$ is a total ordering on $S$.


Proof
By definition of ordering, $\RR$ is a fortiori a reflexive relation.
Hence from Reflexive Relation on Singleton is Well-Ordering:

$\struct {S, \RR}$ is a well-ordered set.
Hence by definition of well-ordered set:

$\RR$ is a total ordering on $S$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

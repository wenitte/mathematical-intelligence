Theorem
The Klein $4$-group $K_4$ and the cyclic group of order $4$ $C_4$ are not isomorphic.


Proof
Note that both $C_4$ and $K_4$ are of order $4$.
Also note that both $C_4$ and $K_4$ are abelian.
By definition, $C_4$ has elements of order $4$.
From Group Isomorphism Preserves Order of Group Element, the image of an element of $C_4$ under an isomorphism to $K_4$ would also be of order $4$.
But $K_4$ has no elements of order $4$.
Hence $C_4$ and $K_4$ are not isomorphic.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $I$ be an indexing set.
Let $\family {\struct {S_\alpha, \tau_\alpha} }_{\alpha \mathop \in I}$ be a family of topological spaces indexed by $I$.
Let $\ds \struct {S, \tau} = \prod_{\alpha \mathop \in I} \struct {S_\alpha, \tau_\alpha}$ be the product space of $\family {\struct {S_\alpha, \tau_\alpha} }_{\alpha \mathop \in I}$.

Let each of $\struct {S_\alpha, \tau_\alpha}$ be countably compact.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $\struct {S, \tau}$ is also countably compact.


Proof
Let $T$ denote the Novak space.
Let $T \times T$ denote the Cartesian product of the Novak space with itself under the product topology.
From Novak Space is Countably Compact, $T$ is a countably compact space.
But from Cartesian Product of Novak Spaces is not Countably Compact, $T \times T$ is not a countably compact space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

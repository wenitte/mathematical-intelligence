Theorem
Let $D$ be a diagonal matrix.
Then $D$ is symmetric.


Proof
By definition of diagonal matrix:

$\forall j, k: j \ne k \implies a_{jk} = 0 = a_{kj}$
So by definition of transpose of $D$:

$D = D^\intercal$
where $D^\intercal$ denotes the transpose.
Hence the result, by definition of symmetric matrix.
$\blacksquare$

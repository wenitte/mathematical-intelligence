Theorem
Let $\struct {\GF, +, \times}$ be a field which has exactly $4$ elements.

Then:

$\forall a \in \GF: a + a = 0_\GF$
where $0_\GF$ is the zero of $\GF$.


Proof
Let $\struct {\GF, +, \times}$ be a field of order $4$ whose zero is $0_\GF$.
By definition, $\GF$ is a Galois field.
The additive group $\struct {\GF, +}$ of $\GF$ can be one of two:

$(1): \quad$ the cyclic group of order $4$, generated by the identity of $\struct {\GF, +}$ which is $0_\GF$
or:

$(2): \quad$ the Klein $4$-group, whose elements are all of the form $a + a = 0_\GF$.

Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $(1)$ is the additive group of a field.
Then the characteristic of $\GF$ is $4$.
But from Characteristic of Galois Field is Prime it follows that $\GF$ is not a field.
From that contradiction it follows that the additive group $\struct {\GF, +}$ of $F$ cannot be the cyclic group of order $4$.
Hence for $\GF$ to be a field at all, it is necessary for $\struct {\GF, +}$ to be the Klein $4$-group.

Theorem
The harmonic series:

$\ds \sum_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty \frac 1 n$
diverges.


Proof
For all $N \in \N$:

$\dfrac 1 N + \dfrac 1 {N + 1} + \cdots + \dfrac 1 {2 N} > N \cdot \dfrac 1 {2 N} = \dfrac 1 2$
Hence, by Cauchy's Convergence Criterion for Series, the Harmonic series is divergent.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The proof that the Harmonic Series is Divergent was discovered by Nicole Oresme.
However, it was lost for centuries, before being rediscovered by Pietro Mengoli in $1647$.
It was discovered yet again in $1687$ by Johann Bernoulli, and a short time after that by Jakob II Bernoulli, after whom it is usually (erroneously) attributed.
Some sources attribute its rediscovery to Jacob Bernoulli.

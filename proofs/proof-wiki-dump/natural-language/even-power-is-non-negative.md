Theorem
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number.
Let $n \in \Z$ be an even integer.

Then $x^n \ge 0$.

That is, all even powers are positive.


Proof
Let $n \in \Z$ be an even integer.
Then $n = 2 k$ for some $k \in \Z$.
Thus:

$\forall x \in \R: x^n = x^{2 k} = \paren {x^k}^2$
But from Square of Real Number is Non-Negative:

$\forall x \in \R: \paren {x^k}^2 \ge 0$
and so there is no real number whose square is negative.
The result follows from Solution to Quadratic Equation.
$\blacksquare$

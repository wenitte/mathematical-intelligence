Theorem
Let $S \subseteq \R$ be a subset of $\R$ such that $S$ is countable, either finite or countably infinite.
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be a real function such that:

$\forall x \in \R \setminus S: \map f x = 0$
That is, except perhaps for the elements of $S$, the value of $f$ is zero.

Then $f$ is a null function.


Proof
This is an instance of Measurable Function Zero A.E. iff Absolute Value has Zero Integral.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
There exists at least one example of a paracompact topological space which is not also a compact topological space.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {\R, \tau_d}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.

From Real Number Line is Paracompact, $T$ is a paracompact space.
From Real Number Line is not Countably Compact, $T$ is not a countably compact space.
From Compact Space is Countably Compact, it follows that  $T$ is not a compact space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

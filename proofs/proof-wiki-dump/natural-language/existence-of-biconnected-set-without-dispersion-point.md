Theorem
There exists at least one example of a biconnected set which does not have a dispersion point.


Proof
Let $T$ be a Miller's biconnected set.

From Miller's Biconnected Set is Biconnected, $T$ is a biconnected set.
From Miller's Biconnected Set is has no Dispersion Point, $T$  does not have a dispersion point.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

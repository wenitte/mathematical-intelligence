Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $23$
A Deal in Cucumbers
"How much to you pay for these cucumbers?" someone asked.
The reply: "I pay as many shillings for six dozen cucumbers of that size as I get cucumbers for $32 \shillings$"
What was the price per cucumber?


Solution
$8 \oldpence$


Proof
Let $P$ be the price per cucumber in pence.
Let $A$ be the price per $6$ dozen cucumbers in shillings.
Let $B$ be the number of cucumbers you can buy for $32 \shillings$.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 6 \times 12 P\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12 A\)





"I pay as many shillings for six dozen cucumbers of that size ...




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {32 \times 12} P\)





... as I get cucumbers for $32 \shillings$"








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 P\)





simplifying $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 P\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {32 \times 12} P\)





substituting for $A$ in $(2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds P^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 64\)





simpifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds P\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8\)





as $P$ must be positive



Hence the solution.
$\blacksquare$

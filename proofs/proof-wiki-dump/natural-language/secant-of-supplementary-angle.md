Theorem
$\map \sec {\pi - \theta} = -\sec \theta$
where $\sec$ denotes secant.

That is, the secant of an angle is the negative of its supplement.


Proof













\(\ds \map \sec {\pi - \theta}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {\map \cos {\pi - \theta} }\)





Secant is Reciprocal of Cosine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {-\cos \theta}\)





Cosine of Supplementary Angle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\sec \theta\)





Secant is Reciprocal of Cosine



$\blacksquare$

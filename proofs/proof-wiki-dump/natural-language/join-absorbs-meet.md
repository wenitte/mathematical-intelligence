Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a meet semilattice.
Let $\vee$ denote join.

Then $\vee$ absorbs $\wedge$.
That is, for all $a, b \in S$:

$a \vee \paren {a \wedge b} = a$


Proof
By Ordering in terms of Join, we have that:

$a \vee \paren {a \wedge b} = a$ if and only if $a \wedge b \preceq a$

The result thus follows from Meet Precedes Operands.
$\blacksquare$


Duality
The dual to this theorem is Meet Absorbs Join.

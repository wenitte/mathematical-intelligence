Theorem
Let $S$ be the Archimedean spiral defined by the equation:

$r = a \theta$

The area $\AA$ enclosed by the first turn of $S$ and the polar axis is given by:

$\AA = \dfrac {4 \pi^3 a^2} 3$





Proof













\(\ds \AA\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac {\paren {a \theta}^2} 2 \rd \theta\)





Area between Radii and Curve in Polar Coordinates‎














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \intlimits {\frac {a^2 \theta^3} 6} 0 {2 \pi}\)





Primitive of Power














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\paren {2 \pi}^3 a^2} 6\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {4 \pi^3 a^2} 3\)





after simplification



$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The Area Enclosed by First Turn of Archimedean Spiral was first determined by Archimedes in his book On Spirals.
His proof appears as Proposition $24$.

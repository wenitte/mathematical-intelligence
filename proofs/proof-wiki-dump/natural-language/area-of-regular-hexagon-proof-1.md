Theorem
Let $H$ be a regular hexagon.
Let the length of one side of $H$ be $s$.
Let $\AA$ be the area of $H$.

Then:

$\AA = \dfrac {3 \sqrt 3} 2 s^2$


Proof
From Regular Hexagon is composed of Equilateral Triangles, it follows that a regular hexagon can be dissected into six congruent equilateral triangles:



Let $\AA_T$ be the area of the bottom triangle. 
Then by Area of Equilateral Triangle:

$ \AA_T = \dfrac{\sqrt 3} 4 s^2 $

As $H$ consists of six congruent triangles, it follows that:

$ \AA = 6\AA_T = \dfrac{6\sqrt 3} 4 s^2 = \dfrac{3\sqrt3} 2 s^2 $
$\blacksquare$

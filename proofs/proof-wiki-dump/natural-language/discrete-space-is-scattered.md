Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space where $\tau$ is the discrete topology on $S$.
Then $T$ is a scattered space.


Proof
We have that Topological Space is Discrete iff All Points are Isolated.
So, by definition, no subset $H \subseteq S$ of $T$ such that $H \ne \O$ is dense-in-itself.
So, again, by definition, $T$ is scattered.
$\blacksquare$

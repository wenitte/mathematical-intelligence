Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Positive Definite Matrix are equivalent:

Definition $1$
$\mathbf A$ is positive definite if and only if:

for all nonzero column matrices $\mathbf x$ of order $n$, $\mathbf x^\intercal \mathbf A \mathbf x$ is strictly positive.
Definition $2$
$\mathbf A$ is positive definite if and only if:

all the eigenvalues of $\mathbf A$ are strictly positive.


Proof
Definition $(1)$ implies Definition $(2)$
Let $\mathbf A$ be a positive definite matrix by definition $1$.

Recall definition $1$ of Positive Definite Matrix:
$\mathbf A$ is positive definite if and only if:

for all nonzero column matrices $\mathbf x$ of order $n$, $\mathbf x^\intercal \mathbf A \mathbf x$ is strictly positive.

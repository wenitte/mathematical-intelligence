Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be an equilateral triangle.
Let $G$ be the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$.
Then:
$G$ is the incenter of $\triangle ABC$.


Proof
Draw the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ through points $A, B,$ and $C$.

Given:  $G$ is the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$.
By Orthocenter, Centroid and Circumcenter Coincide iff Triangle is Equilateral:

$G$ is also the centroid and circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$.

Common Notion 1




By mutatis mutandis:
all the smaller triangles are congruent.
So

$DG = EG = FG$
By the definition of incircle:

$DG$ is a radius of the incircle of $\triangle ABC$.
By definition of center: 

$G$ is the center of the incircle of $\triangle ABC$

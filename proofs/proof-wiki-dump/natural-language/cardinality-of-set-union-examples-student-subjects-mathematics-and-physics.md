Example of Use of Cardinality of Set Union
In a particular group of $75$ students, all studied at least one of the subjects mathematics, physics and chemistry.
All candidates attempted at least one of the questions.

$40$ students studied mathematics.
$60$ students studied physics.
$25$ students studied chemistry.

It follows that:

at least $25$ students studied both mathematics and physics.


Proof
Let:

$S_1$ denote the set of students who studied mathematics.
$S_2$ denote the set of students who studied physics.
$S_3$ denote the set of students who studied chemistry.
Knowledge of the total number of students gives us:

$S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 = 75$

Let $N$ denote the number of students $N$ who studied both mathematics and physics:

$N = S_1 \cap S_2$

From the question:














\(\ds \card {S_1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40\)




















\(\ds \card {S_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60\)




















\(\ds \card {S_3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25\)










The number of students $\card {S_1 \cup S_2}$ who studied either mathematics or physics is not more than $75$, the total number of students.
We have therefore:














\(\ds \card {S_1 \cup S_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \card {S_1} + \card {S_2} - \card {S_1 \cap S_2}\)





Cardinality of Set Union: 2 Sets








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 75\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds 40 + 60 - N\)





where $N$ denotes the number of students who studied both mathematics and physics








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds N\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds 25\)

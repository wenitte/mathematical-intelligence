Theorem
Let $\GF \in \set {\R, \C}$. 
Let $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a normed vector space over $\GF$. 
Let $X^\ast$ be the normed dual space of $X$.
Let $w^\ast$ be the weak-$\ast$ topology on $X^\ast$. 
Let $X^{\ast \ast}$ be the second normed dual of $X$.

Then a linear functional $\phi : \struct {X^\ast, w^\ast} \to \GF$ is continuous if and only if there exists $x \in X$ such that: 

$\phi = x^\wedge$
where $x^\wedge$ is the evaluation linear transformation evaluated at $x$.
That is: 

$\struct {X^\ast, w^\ast}^\ast = \iota X$


Proof
Note that the weak-$\ast$ topology $w^\ast$ is generated as an initial topology by $\set {x^\wedge : x \in X}$. 
This result is then given by Continuity of Linear Functionals in Initial Topology on Vector Space Generated by Linear Functionals, taking $F = \set {x^\wedge : x \in X}$. 
$\blacksquare$

Example of Complex Addition
$\paren {2 + 3 i} + \paren {4 - 5 i} = 6 - 2 i$


Proof

Let the complex numbers $2 + 3 i$ and $4 - 5 i$ be represented by the points $P_1$ and $P_2$ respectively in the complex plane.
Complete the parallelogram with $OP_1$ and $OP_2$ as the adjacent sides.
By the Geometrical Interpretation of Complex Addition, the point $P$ represents the complex number $6 - 2 i$, which is the sum of $2 + 3 i$ and $4 - 5 i$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \set {\O, S} }$ be an indiscrete topological space.
Then $T$ is path-connected.


Proof
Let $a, b \in S$.
Consider any mapping $f: \closedint 0 1 \to S$ such that $\map f 0 = a$ and $\map f 1 = b$.
From Mapping to Indiscrete Space is Continuous, we have that $f$ is ‎continuous.
The result follows by definition of path-connectedness.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $C$ be a cycloid generated by the equations:

$x = a \paren {\theta - \sin \theta}$
$y = a \paren {1 - \cos \theta}$
Then the normal to $C$ at a point $P$ on $C$ passes through the bottom of the generating circle of $C$.


Proof 1
From Normal to Cycloid, the equation for the normal to $C$ at a point $P = \tuple {x, y}$ is given by:


This theorem requires a proof.In particular: We don't even have the definition of a normal to a curve posted up yet, so there's a long way to go here.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by crafting such a proof.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{ProofWanted}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.


Proof 2
From Tangent to Cycloid passes through Top of Generating Circle, the tangent to $C$ at a point $P = \tuple {x, y}$ passes through the top of the generating circle.
By definition, the normal to $C$ at $P$ is perpendicular to the tangent to $C$ at $P$.
From Thales' Theorem, the normal, the tangent and the diameter of the generating circle form a right triangle.
Thus the normal to $C$ at $P$ meets the generating circle at the opposite end of the diameter to the tangent.
Hence the result.

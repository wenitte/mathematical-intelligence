Theorem
Let $A$ be a commutative ring.
Let $e \in A$ be an idempotent element.
Let $\ideal e$ be the ideal of $A$ generated by $e$.

Then the mapping:

$f: A \to \ideal e: a \mapsto e a$
is a surjective ring homomorphism with kernel the ideal $\ideal {1 - e}$ generated by $1 - e$.


Proof
Let $e a \in \ideal e$ for some arbitrary $a \in A$.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Technically, one needs to prove that a general element of $\ideal e$ has this form. --Wandynsky (talk) 15:38, 30 July 2021 (UTC)

Then














\(\ds \map f {e a}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e e a\)





Definition of $f$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds ea\)





$e$ is idempotent



So $f$ is surjective.

Let $x, y \in A$.
Then 














\(\ds \map f {x + y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e \paren {x + y}\)





Definition of $f$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds e x + e y\)





Ring Axiom $\text D$: Distributivity of Product over Addition














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f x + \map f y\)





Definition of $f$



and:














\(\ds \map f {x y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e x y\)





Definition of $f$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^2 x y\)





$e$ is idempotent














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds e x e y\)





$A$ is commutative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f x \map f y\)





Definition of $f$



So $f$ is a ring homomorphism.

We have














\(\ds \map f {1 - e}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e \paren {1 - e}\)





Definition of $f$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^2 - e\)





Ring Axiom $\text D$: Distributivity of Product over Addition














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





$e$ is idempotent



Thus $1 - e \in \map \ker f$ and $\ideal {1 - e} \subseteq \map \ker f$.

Suppose $a \in \map \ker f$.
Then $e a = \map f a = 0$.














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e a + \paren {1 - e} a\)





Ring Axiom $\text D$: Distributivity of Product over Addition














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {1 - e} a\)





$e a = 0$



Thus:

$\map \ker f \subseteq \ideal {1 - e}$
so:

$\map \ker f = \ideal {1 - e}$
$\blacksquare$

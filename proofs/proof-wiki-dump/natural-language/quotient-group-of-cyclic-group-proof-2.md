Theorem
Let $G$ be a cyclic group which is generated by $g$.
Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.

Then $g H$ generates $G / H$.


Proof
Let $H$ be a subgroup of the cyclic group $G = \gen g$.
Then by Homomorphism of Powers for Integers:

$\forall n \in \Z: \map {q_H} {g^n} = \paren {\map {q_H} g}^n = \paren {g H}^n$

As $G = \set {g^n: n \in \Z}$, we conclude that:

$G / H = q_H \sqbrk G = \set {\paren {g H}^n: n \in \Z}$

Thus, by Epimorphism from Integers to Cyclic Group, $g H$ generates $G / H$.
$\blacksquare$

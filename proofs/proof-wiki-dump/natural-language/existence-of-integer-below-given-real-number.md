Theorem
Let $x$ be a real number.

Then there exists an integer less than $x$:

$\forall x \in \R: \exists n \in \Z: n < x$


Proof
Without loss of generality, assume that $x < 0$.
From the Axiom of Archimedes:

$\exists m \in \N: m > -x$
By Real Numbers form Totally Ordered Field, we have that $\R$ is an ordered field.
Therefore by property $(3)$ of Properties of Ordered Field, $\Z \owns -m < x$.
$\blacksquare$

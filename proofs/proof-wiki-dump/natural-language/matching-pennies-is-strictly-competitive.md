Theorem
The game of Matching Pennies is strictly competitive.


Proof
By definition, a strictly competitive game is a game in which the interests of each player are diametrically opposed.
Recall the payoff table of Matching Pennies:




 


$\text B$


$\text A$


$\begin{array}{r {{|}} c {{|}} } & \text{H} & \text{T} \\ \hline \text{H} &  1, -1 & -1, 1 \\ \hline \text{T} & -1, 1 &  1, -1 \\ \hline \end{array}$


It can be seen by inspection that exchanging $\text A$ and $\text B$ results in exactly the same entries in the payoff table.
From the nature of a payoff table it follows that the fortunes of each player are opposite and equal.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

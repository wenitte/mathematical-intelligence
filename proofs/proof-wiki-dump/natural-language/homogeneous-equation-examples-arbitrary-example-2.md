Example of Homogeneous Equation
The equation:

$x^2 + y^2 = 3$
is not a homogeneous equation.

We note that $x^2 + y^2$ is a homogeneous expression:














\(\ds \map E {x, y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x^2 + y^2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map E {k x, k y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds k^2 x^2 + k^2 y^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds k^2 \paren {x^2 + y^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds k^2 \map E {x, y}\)









However, by definition of homogeneous equation, it has to be equated to $0$.
We further observe that $k^2 \paren {x^2 + y^2} = 3 k^2$ not $3$, showing that the complete equation as an expression is not homogeneous.

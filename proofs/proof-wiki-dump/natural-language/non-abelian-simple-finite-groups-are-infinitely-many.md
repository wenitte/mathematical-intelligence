Theorem
There exist infinitely many types of group which are non-abelian and finite.


Proof
We have that Alternating Group is Simple except on 4 Letters.
So for all $n \in \N$ such that $n \ne 4$, the alternating group $A_n$ is a simple group.
We also have that $A_n$ is non-abelian for all $n > 3$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

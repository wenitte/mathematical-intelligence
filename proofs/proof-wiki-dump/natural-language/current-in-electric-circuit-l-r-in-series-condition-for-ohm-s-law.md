Theorem
Consider the electric circuit $K$ consisting of:

a resistance $R$
an inductance $L$
in series with a source of electromotive force $E$ which is a function of time $t$.



Ohm's Law is satisfied by $K$ whenever the current $I$ is at a maximum or a minimum.


Proof
From Electric Current in Electric Circuit: L, R in Series:

$L \dfrac {\d I} {\d t} + R I = E$
defines the behaviour of $I$.

Let $I$ be at a maximum or a minimum.
Then from Derivative at Maximum or Minimum:

$\dfrac {\d I} {\d t} = 0$
and so:














\(\ds E\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0 + R I\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds R I\)









which is Ohm's Law.
$\blacksquare$

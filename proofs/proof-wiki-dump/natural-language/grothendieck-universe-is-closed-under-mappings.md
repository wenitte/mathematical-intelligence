Theorem
Let $\mathbb U$ be a Grothendieck universe.
Let $u, v \in \mathbb U$.
Let $f: u \to v$ be a mapping realized as a relation consisting of ordered pairs in Kuratowski formalization.

Then $f \in \mathbb U$.


Proof
Let $u \times v$ be the finite cartesian product of $u$ and $v$ realized as a set of ordered pairs in Kuratowski formalization.
By definition of mapping, we have $f \subseteq u \times v$.
Then:














\(\ds u, v\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \mathbb U\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds u \times v\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \mathbb U\)





Grothendieck Universe is Closed under Binary Cartesian Product








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds f\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \mathbb U\)





Grothendieck Universe is Closed under Subset and $f \subseteq u \times v$

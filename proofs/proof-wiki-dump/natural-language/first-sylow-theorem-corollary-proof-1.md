Corollary to First Sylow Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $G$ be a group.
Let:

$p^n \divides \order G$
where:

$\order G$ denotes the order of $G$
$n$ is a positive integer.

Then $G$ has at least one subgroup of order $p$.


Proof
Let $\order G = k p^r$ where $p \nmid k$.
From the First Sylow Theorem, $G$ has a subgroup $S$ of order $p^r$.
From (need to find it), $S$ itself has subgroups of order $p^n$ for all $n \in \set {1, 2, \ldots, r}$.

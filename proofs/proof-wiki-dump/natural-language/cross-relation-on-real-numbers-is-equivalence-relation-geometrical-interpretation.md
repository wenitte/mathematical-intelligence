Theorem
Let $\R^2$ denote the cartesian plane.
Let $\alpha$ denote the relation defined on $\R^2$ by:

$\tuple {x_1, y_1} \mathrel \alpha \tuple {x_2, y_2} \iff x_1 + y_2 = x_2 + y_1$

The equivalence classes of $\alpha$, when interpreted as points in the plane, are the straight lines of slope $1$.


Proof
We have from Cross-Relation on Real Numbers is Equivalence Relation that $\alpha$ is an equivalence relation.

Thus:














\(\ds \tuple {x_1, y_1}\)

\(\alpha\)







\(\ds \tuple {x_2, y_2}\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds x_1 + y_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x_2 + y_1\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds x_1 - y_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x_2 - y_2\)









Thus each equivalence classes consists of sets of points such that:

$x - y = c$
That is:

$y = x + c$
Thus from Equation of Straight Line in Plane, this is the equation of a straight line whose slope is $1$.

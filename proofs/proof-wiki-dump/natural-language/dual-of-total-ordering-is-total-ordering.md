Theorem
Let $\preccurlyeq$ be a total ordering.

Then its dual ordering $\succcurlyeq$ is also a total ordering.


Proof
Let $\struct {S, \preccurlyeq}$ be a totally ordered set.
From Dual Ordering is Ordering we have that $\succcurlyeq$ is an ordering.

Let $x, y \in S$.
Then $x \preccurlyeq y$ or $y \preccurlyeq x$ since $\preccurlyeq$ is total.
By definition of dual ordering, also $y \succcurlyeq x$ or $x \succcurlyeq y$.
Hence the result, by definition of total ordering.
$\blacksquare$

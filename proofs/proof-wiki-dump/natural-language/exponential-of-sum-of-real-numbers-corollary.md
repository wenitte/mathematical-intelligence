Corollary to Exponential of Sum of Real Numbers
Let $x, y \in \R$ be real numbers.
Let $\exp x$ be the exponential of $x$.

Then:

$\map \exp {x - y} = \dfrac {\exp x} {\exp y}$


Proof
By Exponential of Sum of Real Numbers:

$\map \exp {x - y} = \exp x \, \map \exp {-y}$

Although this article appears correct, it's inelegant. There has to be a better way of doing it.In particular: No real counterpart exists to link toYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by redesigning it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Improve}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
By Reciprocal of Complex Exponential:

$\dfrac 1 {\exp y} = \map \exp {-y}$
Combining these two, we obtain the result:

$\map \exp {x - y} = \dfrac {\exp x} {\exp y}$
$\blacksquare$

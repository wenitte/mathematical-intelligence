Theorem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
Let $\struct {S, +, *}$ be a ring with unity.
Let $f: R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism.
Let $\struct {S_R, *}$ be the algebra defined by the ring homomorphism $f$.

Then $\struct {S_R, *}$ is a unitary algebra.


Proof
By definition, the multiplication of $\struct {S_R, *}$ is the ring product of $S$.
Thus it follows immediately from the fact that $S$ is a ring with unity, that $\struct {S_R, *}$ is a unitary algebra.
$\blacksquare$

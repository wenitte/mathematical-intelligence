Theorem
Let $n$ be an integer.
Suppose that $\sqrt n$ is a rational number.

Then $\sqrt n$ is an integer.


Proof
Suppose that $\sqrt n = \dfrac a b$, with $a, b$ coprime integers and $b > 0$.

Then we would have:

$n = \dfrac {a^2} {b^2}$
That is:

$n b^2 = a^2$
From Number divides Number iff Square divides Square:

$b^2 \divides a^2 \implies b \divides a$
However, since $a \perp b$ and $b \divides a$, this means that necessarily $b = 1$.

That is, $\sqrt n = a$, an integer.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

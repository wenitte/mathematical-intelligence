Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If a magnitude be the same multiple of a magnitude that a part subtracted is of a part subtracted, the remainder will also be the same multiple of the remainder that the whole is of the whole.
(The Elements: Book $\text{V}$: Proposition $5$)

That is, for any numbers $a, b$ and for any integer $m$:

$m a - m b = m \paren {a - b}$


Proof 1
Let the magnitude $AB$ be the same multiple of the magnitude $CD$ that the part $AE$ subtracted is of the part $CF$ subtracted.
We need to show that the remainder $EB$ is also the same multiple of the remainder $FD$ that the whole $AB$ is of the whole $CD$.


Whatever multiple $AE$ is of $CF$, let $EB$ be made that multiple of $CG$.
We have that $AE$ is the same multiple of $CF$ that $AB$ is of $GC$.
So from Distributive Property, $AE$ is the same multiple of $CF$ that $AB$ is of $GF$.
By by assumption, $AE$ is the same multiple of $CF$ that $AB$ is of $CD$.
Therefore $AB$ is the same multiple of each of the magnitudes $GF, CD$.
Therefore $GF = CD$.
Let $CF$ be subtracted from each.
Then the remainder $GC$ is equal to the remainder $FD$.
Since:

$AE$ is the same multiple of $CF$ that $EB$ is of $GC$
$GC = DF$
it follows that $AE$ is the same multiple of $CF$ that $EB$ is of $CD$.
That is, the remainder $EB$ will be the same multiple of the remainder $FD$ that the whole $AB$ is of the whole $CD$.

Theorem
Let $E$ be a vector space of $n$ dimensions.
Let $H$ be a linearly independent subset of $E$.

$H$ is a basis for $E$ if and only if it contains exactly $n$ elements.


Proof
By hypothesis, let $H$ be a linearly independent subset of $E$


Necessary Condition
Let $H$ be a basis for $E$.
By definition of dimension of vector space, a basis for $E$ contains exactly $n$ elements.
By Bases of Finitely Generated Vector Space have Equal Cardinality, it follows that $H$ also contains exactly $n$ elements.
$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Let $H$ contain exactly $n$ elements.
By Sufficient Conditions for Basis of Finite Dimensional Vector Space $H$ is itself a basis for $E$.
$\blacksquare$

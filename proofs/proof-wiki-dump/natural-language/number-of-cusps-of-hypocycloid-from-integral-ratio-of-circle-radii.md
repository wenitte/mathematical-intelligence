Theorem
Let $H$ be a hypocycloid $H$ generated by a circle $C_1$ of radius $b$ rolling within a circle $C_2$ of (larger) radius $a$.
Let $a = n b$ where $n$ is an integer.

Then $H$ has $n$ cusps.


Proof
The length of the arc of $C_2$ between two adjacent cusps of $H$ is $2 \pi b$.
The total length of the circumference of $C_1$ is $2 \pi a$.
Thus the total number of cusps of $H$ is:

$\dfrac {2 \pi a} {2 \pi b} = \dfrac {2 \pi n b} {2 \pi b} = n$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau}$ denote the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.
Let $\Q$ be the set of rational numbers.

Then:

$\paren {\Q \cap \paren {\R \setminus \Q} }^- = \O$
where:

$\R \setminus \Q$ denotes the set of irrational numbers
$\paren {\Q \cap \paren {\R \setminus \Q} }^-$ denotes the closure of $\Q \cap \paren {\R \setminus \Q}$.


Proof
From Set Difference Intersection with Second Set is Empty Set:

$\Q \cap \paren {\R \setminus \Q} = \O$
By Empty Set is Closed in Topological Space, $\O$ is closed in $\R$.
From Closed Set Equals its Closure:

$\O^- = \O$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

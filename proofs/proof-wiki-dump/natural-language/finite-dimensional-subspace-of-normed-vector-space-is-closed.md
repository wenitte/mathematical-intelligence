Proof 1
Suppose that $\dim W = n$.
Let: 

$\set {e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n}$
be a basis for $W$.
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose that $W$ is not a closed set.
Then there exists a convergent sequence $\sequence {w_k}$ in $W$ such that: 

$w_k \to w$ in $V$
where $w \in V \setminus W$.
Note that:

$\set {e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n}$
is linearly independent in $W$, and hence $V$.
Note that since $w \not \in W$, $w$ cannot be written as a linear combination of elements of $\set {e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n}$.
So:

$\set {e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n, w}$
is linearly independent in $V$.

So consider the subspace:

$W^* = \span \set {e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n, w}$.
Using the sequence $\sequence {w_n}$ from before, write: 

$w_k = \tuple {w_k^{\paren 1}, w_k^{\paren 2}, \ldots, w_k^{\paren n}, 0} \in W^*$
and:

$w = \tuple {0, 0, \ldots, 0, 1} \in W^*$
Since Norms on Finite-Dimensional Real Vector Space are Equivalent, $w_k\to w$ in direct product norm.
Since sequence of vectors converges iff each component converges, we necessarily have: 

$w_k^{\paren j} \to 0$
for each $1 \le j \le n$.
However, since the $(n+1)$-th component of $w_k$ is 0 and that of $w$ is $1$, we would also have: 

$0 \to 1$
Clearly this is impossible, so we have derived a contradiction.
So $W$ is necessarily closed.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Because $K$ is complete, the finite dimensional normed space $W$ is complete.
By Subspace of Complete Metric Space is Closed iff Complete, $W$ is closed.
$\blacksquare$


Necessity of completeness of the ground field

This page or section has statements made on it that ought to be extracted and proved in a Theorem page.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by creating any appropriate Theorem pages that may be needed.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.
$K = \Q$ is not complete.
$W = \Q$
$V = \Q \sqbrk {\sqrt 2}$
Since

$\dim_K W = 1$
$W$ is a finite dimensional subspace of $V$. 
But $W$ is not closed in $V$.

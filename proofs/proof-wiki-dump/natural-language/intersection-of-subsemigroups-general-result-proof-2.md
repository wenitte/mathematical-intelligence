Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a semigroup.

Let $\mathbb H$ be a set of subsemigroups of $\struct {S, \circ}$, where $\mathbb H \ne \O$.

Then the intersection $\bigcap \mathbb H$ of the members of $\mathbb H$ is the largest subsemigroup of $\struct {S, \circ}$ contained in each member of $\mathbb H$.


Proof
From Set of Subsemigroups forms Complete Lattice:

$\struct {\mathbb S, \subseteq}$ is a complete lattice.
where for every set $\mathbb H$ of subsemigroups of $S$:

the infimum of $\mathbb H$ necessarily admitted by $\mathbb H$ is $\ds \bigcap \mathbb H$.
Hence the result, by definition of infimum.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a set and let $\PP$ be a partition on $S$ which is not the (trivial) partition of singletons.
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be the partition space whose basis is $\PP$.

Then $T$ is not a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $T$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.
Then from $T_1$ Space is $T_0$ Space, $T$ is a $T_0$ (Kolmogorov) space.
This contradicts the result Partition Topology is not $T_0$.
Hence the result, by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

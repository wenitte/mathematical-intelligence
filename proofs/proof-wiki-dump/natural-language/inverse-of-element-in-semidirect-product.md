Theorem
Let $N$ and $H$ be groups.
Let $H$ act by automorphisms on $N$ via $\phi$.
Let $N \rtimes_\phi H$ be the corresponding (outer) semidirect product.
Let $\tuple {n, h} \in N \rtimes_\phi H$.

Then:














\(\ds \tuple {n, h}^{-1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {\map {\phi_{h^{-1} } } {n^{-1} }, h^{-1} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {\paren {\map {\phi_{h^{-1} } } n}^{-1}, h^{-1} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {\map { {\phi_h}^{-1} } {n^{-1} }, h^{-1} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {\paren {\map { {\phi_h}^{-1} } n}^{-1}, h^{-1} }\)











Proof
Follows from Semidirect Product of Groups is Group.
The alternatives follow from the fact that $H$ acts by automorphisms.

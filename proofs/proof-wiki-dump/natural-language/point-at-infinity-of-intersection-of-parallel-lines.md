Theorem
Let $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$ be straight lines embedded in a cartesian plane $\CC$ such that $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$ are parallel.
By Condition for Straight Lines in Plane to be Parallel, $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$ can be expressed as the general equations:






\(\ds \LL_1: \ \ \)







\(\ds l x + m y + n_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)












\(\ds \LL_2: \ \ \)







\(\ds l x + m y + n_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)










The point at infinity of $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$ can thence be expressed in homogeneous Cartesian coordinates as $\tuple {-m, l, 0}$.


Proof
Let $\LL_1$ be expressed in the form:

$l x + m y + n = 0$
Hence let $\LL_2$ be expressed in the form:

$l x + m y + k n = 0$
where $k \ne 1$.
Let their point of intersection be expressed in homogeneous Cartesian coordinates as $\tuple {X, Y, Z}$
Then:














\(\ds \tuple {X, Y, Z}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {m n \paren {k - 1}, n l \paren {1 - k}, 0}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {-m, l, 0}\)

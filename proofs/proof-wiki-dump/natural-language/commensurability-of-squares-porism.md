Porism to Commensurability of Squares
In the words of Euclid:

And it is manifest from what has been proven that straight lines commensurable in length are always commensurable in square also, but those commensurable in square are not always commensurable in length also.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $9$ : Porism)


Proof
Follows directly from Commensurability of Squares.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $9$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.

Then for each $h \in H$, the inverse of $h$ in $H$ is the same as the inverse of $h$ in $G$.


Proof
Let $h \in H$.
Let:

$h'$ be the inverse of $h$ in $H$
$h^{-1}$ be the inverse of $h$ in $G$.

From Identity of Subgroup:

$h \circ h' = e$
From Inverse in Group is Unique, it follows that $h' = h^{-1}$.
$\blacksquare$

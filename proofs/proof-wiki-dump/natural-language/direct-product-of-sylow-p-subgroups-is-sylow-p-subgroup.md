Theorem
Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be groups.
Let $H_1$ and $H_2$ be subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$ respectively.

Let $H_1$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G_1$.
Let $H_2$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G_2$.

Then $H_1 \times H_2$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G_1 \times G_2$.


Proof
By definition of Sylow $p$-subgroup:

$\order {H_1} = p^r$, where $p^r$ is the highest power of $p$ which is a divisor of $\order {G_1}$.
$\order {H_2} = p^s$, where $p^s$ is the highest power of $p$ which is a divisor of $\order {G_2}$.

We have that:

$\order {H_1 \times H_2} = p^{r + s}$
We also have that $p^{r + s}$ is the highest power of $p$ which is a divisor of $\order {G_1 \times G_2}$.
Hence it follows by definition that $H_1 \times H_2$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G_1 \times G_2$.

Theorem
Let $A, B$ be distinct points in the plane.
Let $\lambda \in \R_{>0}$ be a strictly positive real number.

Let $X$ be the locus of points in the plane such that:

$XA = \lambda \paren {XB}$

Then $X$ is in the form of a circle, known as a circle of Apollonius.




If $\lambda < 1$, then $A$ is inside the circle, and $B$ is outside.
If $\lambda > 1$, then $B$ is inside the circle, and $A$ is outside.


Proof

Let $P$ be an arbitrary point such that $\dfrac {AP} {PB} = \lambda$.
Let $\angle APB$ be bisected internally and externally to intersect $AB$ at $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
Then:

$\dfrac {AX} {XB} = \dfrac {AP} {PB} = \lambda$
and:

$\dfrac {AY} {YB} = \dfrac {AP} {PB} = \lambda$

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: explain why the aboveYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Thus $X$ and $Y$ are the points which divide $AB$ internally and externally in the given ratio.
Therefore, for a given $A$, $B$ and $\lambda$, $X$ and $Y$ are fixed.
From Bisectors of Adjacent Angles between Straight Lines Meeting at Point are Perpendicular, $\angle XPY$ is a right angle.
Hence by Thales' Theorem, $P$ lies on the circumference of a circle of which $XY$ is a diameter.

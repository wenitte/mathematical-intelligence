Example of Ordering which is not Lattice Ordering
Recall the partial ordering on the set of straight lines:
Let $S$ denote the set of all infinite straight lines embedded in a cartesian plane.
Let $\LL$ denote the relation on $S$ defined as:

$a \mathrel \LL b$ if and only if:
$a$ is parallel $b$
if $a$ is not parallel to the $y$-axis, then coincides with or lies below $b$
but if $b$ is parallel to the $y$-axis, then $a$ coincides with or lies to the right of $b$

Its dual $\LL^{-1}$ is defined as:

$a \mathrel {\LL^{-1} } b$ if and only if:
$a$ is parallel $b$
if $a$ is not parallel to the $y$-axis, then coincides with or lies above $b$
but if $b$ is parallel to the $y$-axis, then $a$ coincides with or lies to the left of $b$.

Then $\LL$ and $\LL^{-1}$ are partial orderings on $S$.

$S$ is not a lattice ordering.


Proof
Two straight lines admit a supremum and infimum when parallel.
Hence, by definition, $S$ is not a lattice ordering.

Theorem
Let $x$ be a real number.
Let $\exp$ denote the  (real) Exponential Function.

Then:

$\forall x \in \RÂ : \exp x > 0$


Proof
This proof assumes the definition of $\exp$ as the inverse mapping of extension of $\ln$, where $\ln$ denotes the  natural logarithm.

Recall that the domain of $\ln$ is $\R_{>0}$.
From the definition of  inverse mapping, the image of $\exp$ is the domain of $\ln$.
That is, the image of $\exp$ is $\R_{>0}$.

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

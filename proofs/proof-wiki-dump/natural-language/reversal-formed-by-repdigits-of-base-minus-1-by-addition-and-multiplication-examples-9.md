Example of Reversal formed by Repdigits of Base minus 1 by Addition and Multiplication













\(\ds 9 + 9\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 18\)




















\(\ds 9 \times 9\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 81\)











Proof
A direct application of Reversal formed by Repdigits of Base minus 1 by Addition and Multiplication:
$\blacksquare$

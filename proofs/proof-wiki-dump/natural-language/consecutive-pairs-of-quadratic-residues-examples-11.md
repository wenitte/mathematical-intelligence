Examples of Consecutive Pairs of Quadratic Residues
There are $2$ consecutive pairs of quadratic residues modulo $11$.
This is consistent with the number of such consecutive pairs being $\floor {\dfrac {11} 4}$.


Proof
From Quadratic Residues modulo $11$:

$\set {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}$ are the quadratic residues modulo $11$
The set of pairs of consecutive quadratic residues modulo $11$ is therefore:

$\set {\set {3, 4}, \set {4, 5} }$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

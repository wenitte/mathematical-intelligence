Theorem
Let $\R^2$ denote the cartesian plane.
Let $\alpha$ denote the relation defined on $\R^2$ by:

$\tuple {x_1, y_1} \mathrel \alpha \tuple {x_2, y_2} \iff x_1 + y_2 = x_2 + y_1$
Then $\alpha$ is an equivalence relation on $\R^2$.


Geometrical Interpretation
The equivalence classes of $\alpha$, when interpreted as points in the plane, are the straight lines of slope $1$.


Proof
$\alpha$ is an instance of a cross-relation.
We also have that Real Addition is Commutative.
The result therefore follows from Cross-Relation is Equivalence Relation.

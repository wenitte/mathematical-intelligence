Theorem
Let $X$ be an uncountable set.
Let $\AA$ be the $\sigma$-algebra of countable sets on $X$.

Then the co-countable measure $\mu$ on $X$ is a probability measure.


Proof
By Co-Countable Measure is Measure, $\mu$ is a measure.

By Relative Complement with Self is Empty Set, have $\relcomp X X = \O$.
As $\O$ is countable, it follows that $X$ is co-countable.
Hence $\map \mu X = 1$, and so $\mu$ is a probability measure.

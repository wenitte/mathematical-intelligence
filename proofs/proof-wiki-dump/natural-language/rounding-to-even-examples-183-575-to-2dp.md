Example of Rounding to Even
$183 \cdotp 575$ rounded to $2$ decimal places using rounding to even is $183 \cdotp 58$.


Proof
We have that $183 \cdotp 575$ is equally far away from $183 \cdotp 57$ as it is from $183 \cdotp 58$.
But $183 \cdotp 58$ ends in an even integer.
That is, $18 \, 358$ is even.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

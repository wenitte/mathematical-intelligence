Theorem
Let $R$ be the null ring.
That is, let:

$R := \struct {\set {0_R}, +, \circ}$
where ring addition and ring product are defined as:














\(\ds 0_R + 0_R\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0_R\)




















\(\ds 0_R \circ 0_R\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0_R\)










Then $R$ is a commutative ring.


Proof
From Null Ring is Trivial Ring, we have that $R$ is a trivial ring.
The result follows from Trivial Ring is Commutative Ring.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $M$ be a class which is minimally inductive under a progressing mapping $g$.
Then for all $x, y \in M$:

$x \subset y \implies \map g x \subseteq y$


Proof
From Minimally Inductive Class under Progressing Mapping induces Nest, we have that $M$ is a nest in which:

$\forall x, y \in M: \map g x \subseteq y \lor y \subseteq x$
Thus corollary $1$ of the Sandwich Principle applies directly.
$\blacksquare$

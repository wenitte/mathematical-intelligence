Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers.
Let $\tau_p$ be the topology induced by the non-Archimedean norm $\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$.

Then the topological space $\struct {\Q_p, \tau_p}$ is locally compact.


Proof
From Local Basis of P-adic Number:

$\forall a \in \Q_p$: the set $\set {\map {B_{p^{-n} } } a: n \in Z}$ is a local basis of $a$.
From Open and Closed Balls in P-adic Numbers are Compact Subspaces;

$\forall a \in \Q_p$: the set $\set {\map {B_{p^{-n} } } a: n \in Z}$ is a local basis of compact sets of $a$.
Hence $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ is locally compact by definition.
$\blacksquare$

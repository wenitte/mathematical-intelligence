Theorem
Let $\struct {A, \ast}$ be a $\ast$-algebra over $\C$.
Let $x \in A$.

Then:

$\map \Im {i x} = \map \Re x$
where $\Re$ and $\Im$ denote the real and imaginary parts of $A$.


Proof
We have:














\(\ds \map \Im {i x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {i x - \paren {i x}^\ast} {2 i}\)

\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {i x + i x^\ast} {2 i}\)

\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {x + x^\ast} 2\)

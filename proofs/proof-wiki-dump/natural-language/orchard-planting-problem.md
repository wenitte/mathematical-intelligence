Classic Problem
A given number $n$ of trees are to be planted in an orchard so as to make the number of rows of $k$ trees the largest number possible.
That is:
$n$ points are to be configured in the plane so that the number of straight lines that can be drawn through exactly $k$ of these points is maximised.


Classic Form
A given number $n$ of trees are to be planted in an orchard so as to make the number of rows of $3$ trees the largest number possible.
That is:
$n$ points are to be configured in the plane so that the number of straight lines that can be drawn through exactly $3$ of these points is maximised.

$12$ trees, $3$ in a row


The number of rows is $19$.
$3$ of the points are at infinity.
One of the $19$ rows is also at infinity, and passes through each of those $3$ points.
$\blacksquare$


Also known as
The orchard planting problem can be seen hyphenated: orchard-planting problem.
It is also known as the orchard problem or tree-planting problem.
Note, however, that there exists another, completely different, orchard problem: the Orchard Visibility Problem, with which this one may be confused.

Historical Note
The Orchard Planting Problem appears to have first been set by John Jackson in his $1821$ collection Rational Amusement for Winter Evenings, where he worded it poetically as:

1. Your aid I want, nine trees to plant
In rows just half a score;
And let there be in each row three.
Solve this: I ask no more.
2. Fain would I plant a grove in rows
But how must I its form compose
With three trees in each row;
To have as many rows as trees;
Now tell me, artists, if you please;
'Tis all I want to know.
3. Ingenious artists, if you please
To plant a grove, pray show,
In twenty-three rows with fifteen trees
And three in every row.
4. It is required to plant $17$ trees in $24$ rows,
and to have $3$ trees in every row.

5. Ingenious artists, pray dispose
Twenty-four trees in twenty-four rows.
Three trees I'd have in every row;
A pond in midst I'd have also.
A plan thereof I fain would have,
And therefore your assistance crave.
6. Fam'd arborists, display your power
And show how I may plant a bower
With verdant fir and yew:
Twelve trees of each I would dispose,
In only eight-and-twenty rows;
Four trees in each to view.
7. Plant $27$ trees in $15$ rows, $5$ to a row.
8. Ingenious artists, if you please,
Now plant me five-and-twenty trees,
In twenty-eight rows, nor less, nor more;
In some rows five, some three, some four.
9. It is required to plant $90$ trees in $10$ rows, with $10$ trees in each row; each tree equidistant from the other, also each row equidistant from a pond in the centre.
10. A gentleman has a quadrangular irregular piece of ground, in which he is desirous of planting a quincunx, in such a manner, that all the rows of trees, whether transversal or diagonal, shall all be right lines. How must this be done?
Note: A real quincunx is a plantation of trees disposed in a square, consisting of five trees, one at each corner, and the fifth in the middle; but in the present case, the trees are to be disposed in a quadrangle, one at each corner (as in the square), and the fifth at the point of intersection of the two diagonals.

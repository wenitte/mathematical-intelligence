Example of Primitive Pythagorean Triangle
The triangle whose sides are of length $7$, $24$ and $25$ is a primitive Pythagorean triangle.





Proof













\(\ds 7^2 + 24^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 49 + 576\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 625\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25^2\)









It follows by Pythagoras's Theorem that $7$, $24$ and $25$ form a Pythagorean triple.

Note that $7$ and $24$ are coprime.
Hence, by definition, $7$, $24$ and $25$ form a primitive Pythagorean triple.
The result follows by definition of a primitive Pythagorean triangle.
$\blacksquare$

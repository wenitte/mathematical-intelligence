Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a discrete topological space.
Then $T$ is non-meager.


Proof
Let $x \in S$ be an arbitrary point of $T$.
From Set in Discrete Topology is Clopen it follows that $\set x$ is open in $T$.
The result follows from Space with Open Point is Non-Meager.
$\blacksquare$

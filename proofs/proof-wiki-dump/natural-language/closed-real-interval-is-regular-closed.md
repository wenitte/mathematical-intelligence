Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.
Let $\closedint a b$ be a closed interval of $\R$.

Then $\closedint a b$ is regular closed in $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$.


Proof
From Closed Real Interval is Closed in Real Number Line, $\closedint a b$ is closed in $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$.
From Interior of Closed Real Interval is Open Real Interval:

$\closedint a b^\circ = \openint a b$
where $\closedint a b^\circ$ denotes the interior of $\closedint a b$.
From Closure of Open Real Interval is Closed Real Interval:

$\openint a b^- = \closedint a b$
where $\openint a b^-$ denotes the closure of $\openint a b$.
Hence the result, by definition of regular closed.
$\blacksquare$

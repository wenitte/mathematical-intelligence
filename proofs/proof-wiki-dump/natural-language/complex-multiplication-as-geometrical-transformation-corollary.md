Corollary to Complex Multiplication as Geometrical Transformation
Let $z = \polar {r, \theta}$ be a complex number expressed in polar form.
Let $z$ be represented on the complex plane $\C$ in vector form.

The effect of multiplying $z$ by $e^{i \alpha}$ is to rotate it about the origin of $\C$ by $\alpha$ in the positive direction


Proof
From Complex Multiplication as Geometrical Transformation, the effect of multiplying a complex number by $r e^{i \alpha}$ is:

to rotate it about the origin of $\C$ by $\alpha$ in the positive direction
to multiply its modulus by $r$.
In this instance $r = 1$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

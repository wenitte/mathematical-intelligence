Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\RR \subseteq S \times S$ be an equivalence relation on $S$.

Let $T \subseteq S$ be a subset of $S$.
Let $\RR {\restriction_T} \subseteq T \times T$ be the restriction of $\RR$ to $T$.

Then $\RR {\restriction_T}$ is an equivalence relation on $T$.


Proof
Let $\RR$ be an equivalence relation on $S$.
Then by definition:

$\RR$ is a reflexive relation on $S$
$\RR$ is a symmetric relation on $S$
$\RR$ is a transitive relation on $S$.
Then:

from Restriction of Reflexive Relation is Reflexive, $\RR {\restriction_T}$ is a reflexive relation on $T$
from Restriction of Symmetric Relation is Symmetric, $\RR {\restriction_T}$ is a symmetric relation on $T$
from Restriction of Transitive Relation is Transitive, $\RR {\restriction_T}$ is a transitive relation on $T$
and so it follows by definition that $\RR {\restriction_T}$ is an equivalence relation on $T$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \set {\O, S} }$ be an indiscrete topological space.
Let $H \subseteq S$.

$H$ is an $F_\sigma$ ($F$-sigma) set of $T$ if and only if either $H = S$ or $H = \O$.


Proof
An $F_\sigma$ set is a set which can be written as a countable union of closed sets of $S$.
Hence the only $F_\sigma$ sets of $T$ are made from unions of $T$ and $\O$.
So $T$ and $\O$ are the only $F_\sigma$ sets of $T$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.

Then $S$ has a Hartogs number.


Proof 1
From Hartogs' lemma there exists an ordinal $\alpha$ such that there is no injection from $\alpha$ to $S$.
We also have that Ordinals are Well-Ordered.
It follows from the definition of well-ordering that there exists a smallest such ordinal.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Follows immediately from Cardinal Equal to Collection of All Dominated Ordinals.
The collection of all dominated ordinals:

$\set {y \in \On: y \preccurlyeq S}$
is the Hartogs number of $S$.
$\blacksquare$

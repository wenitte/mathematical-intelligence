Theorem
Let $M$ be a type $3$ lever.
Then the mechanical advantage of $M$ is less than $1$.

Hence, instead of amplifying the force applied, a type $3$ lever amplifies the velocity ratio.


Proof
From Principle of Lever:

$\text {MA} = \dfrac b a$
where:

$b$ is the distance of the effort from the fulcrum
$a$ is the distance of the load from the fulcrum.
But in a type $3$ lever, the effort acts between the load and the fulcrum.
That is:

$a > b$
and hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

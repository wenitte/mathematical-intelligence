Corollary to Derivative of Secant Function
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sec a x} = a \sec a x \tan a x$


Proof













\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sec x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sec x \tan x\)





Derivative of $\sec x$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sec a x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \sec a x \tan a x\)

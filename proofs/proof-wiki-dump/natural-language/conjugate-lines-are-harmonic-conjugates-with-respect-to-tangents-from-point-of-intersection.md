Theorem
Let $\CC$ be a circle.
Let $\PP$ and $\QQ$ be conjugate lines with respect to $\CC$.
Let $\PP$ and $\QQ$ intersect at $O$.
Let $OS$ and $OT$ be the tangents to $\CC$ from $O$.

Then $\PP$ and $\QQ$ are harmonic conjugates with respect to $OS$ and $OT$.


Proof
Let $P$ and $Q$ be the poles of $\PP$ and $\QQ$ with respect to $\CC$.
Because $O$ lies on both $\PP$ and $\QQ$, its polar passes through both $P$ and $Q$.
That is, the polar of $O$ is $PQ$ itself.




The polar of $O$, by definition, is the chord of contact of $OS$ and $OT$ with $\CC$.
From Intersections of Line joining Conjugate Points with Circle form Harmonic Range, $\tuple {PQ, ST}$ forms a harmonic range.
Hence $\map O {PQ, ST}$ forms a harmonic pencil.

That is, $\PP$ and $\QQ$ are harmonic conjugates with respect to $OS$ and $OT$.
$\blacksquare$

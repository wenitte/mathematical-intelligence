Historical Note on Metrodorus' Arithmetical Epigram no. $143$
The father perished in the shoals of the Syrtis, and this, the eldest of the brothers, came back from that voyage with five talents.
To me he gave twice two-thirds of his share,
on our mother he bestowed two-eighths of my share,
nor did he sin against divine justice.

In W.R. Paton's $1918$ translation of The Greek Anthology Book XIV, he gives the answer as:

the elder brother had $1 \frac 5 7$ talents
the narrator had $2 \frac 2 7$ talents
the mother had $1$ talent.

The discrepancy between this and the shares reported in the calculation appears to be due to a misinterpretation of the wording.

If we replace:

on our mother he bestowed two-eighths of my share
with:

on our mother he bestowed two-eighths of our combined share
then we arrive at the solution given by The Greek Anthology Book XIV.


Proof
Let $a$ talents be the elder brother's share.
Let $b$ talents be the narrator's share.
Let $c$ talents be the mother's share.

We have:














\(\ds a + b + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)




















\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times \dfrac 2 3 a\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {4 a} 3\)




















\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 2 8 {a + b}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 4 \paren {a + \dfrac {4 a} 3}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {7 a} {12}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a + \dfrac {4 a} 3 + \dfrac {7 a} {12}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 12 a + 16 a + 7 a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12 \times 5\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 35 a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12} 7\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 \dfrac 5 7\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 4 3 \times \dfrac {12} 7\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {16} 7\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \dfrac 2 7\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 4 \times \paren {\dfrac {16} 7 + \dfrac {12} 7}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 4 \times \dfrac {28} 7\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)










So:

the elder brother takes $1 \frac 5 7$ talents
the narrator takes $2 \frac 2 7$ talents
the mother takes $1$ talent.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $V$ be a topological vector space.
Let $\family {M_i}_{i \mathop \in I}$ be an $I$-indexed family of closed linear subspaces of $V$.

Then $MÂ := \ds \bigcap_{i \mathop \in I} M_i$ is also a closed linear subspace of $V$.


Proof
By Set of Linear Subspaces is Closed under Intersection, $M$ is a linear subspace of $V$.

By Topology Defined by Closed Sets, the intersection of closed sets is again closed.
As the $M_i$ are all closed, it follows that $M$ is closed.

Hence $M$ is a closed linear subspace of $V$.

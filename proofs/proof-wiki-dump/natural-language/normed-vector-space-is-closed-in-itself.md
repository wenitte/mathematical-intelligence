Theorem
Let $M = \struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,}}$ be a normed vector space.

Then $X$ is closed in $M$.


Proof
From Empty Set is Open in Normed Vector Space, $\O$ is open in $M$.
But:

$X = \relcomp X \O$
where $\complement_X$ denotes the set complement relative to $X$.
The result follows by definition of closed set.
$\blacksquare$

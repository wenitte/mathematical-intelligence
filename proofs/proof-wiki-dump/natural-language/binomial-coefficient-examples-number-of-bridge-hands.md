Theorem
The total number $N$ of possible different hands for a game of bridge is:

$N = \dfrac {52!} {13! \, 39!} = 635 \ 013 \ 559 \ 600$


Prime Factors
The prime decomposition of the number of bridge hands is given as:

$\dbinom {52} {13} = 2^4 \times 5^2 \times 7^2 \times 17 \times 23 \times 41 \times 43 \times 47$


Proof
The total number of cards in a standard deck is $52$.
The number of cards in a single bridge hand is $13$.
Thus $N$ is equal to the number of ways $13$ things can be chosen from $52$.
Thus:














\(\ds N\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dbinom {52} {23}\)





Cardinality of Set of Subsets














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {52!} {13! \left({52 - 13}\right)!}\)

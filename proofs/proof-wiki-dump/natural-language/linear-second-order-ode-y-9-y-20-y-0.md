Theorem
The second order ODE:

$(1): \quad y - 9 y' + 20 y = 0$
has the general solution:

$y = C_1 e^{4 x} + C_2 e^{5 x}$


Proof
It can be seen that $(1)$ is a constant coefficient homogeneous linear second order ODE.
Its auxiliary equation is:

$(2): \quad: m^2 - 9 m + 20 = 0$
From Solution to Quadratic Equation with Real Coefficients, the roots of $(2)$ are:

$m_1 = 4$
$m_2 = 5$

These are real and unequal.
So from Solution of Constant Coefficient Homogeneous LSOODE, the general solution of $(1)$ is:

$y = C_1 e^{4 x} + C_2 e^{5 x}$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $M = \struct {S, \mathscr I}$ be a matroid.
Let $D$ be a dependent subset of $M$.
Let $B$ be a base of $M$.

Then:

$D \setminus B \ne \O$


Proof
By definition of matroid base:

$B$ is an independent subset of $M$
From Set Difference of Matroid Dependent Set with Independent Set is Non-empty:

$D \setminus B \ne \O$
$\blacksquare$

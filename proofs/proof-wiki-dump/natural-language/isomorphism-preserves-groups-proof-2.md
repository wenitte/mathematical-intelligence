Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ and $\struct {T, *}$ be algebraic structures.
Let $\phi: \struct {S, \circ} \to \struct {T, *}$ be an isomorphism.

If $\struct {S, \circ}$ is a group, then so is $\struct {T, *}$.


Proof
An isomorphism is an epimorphism.
The result follows as a direct corollary of Epimorphism Preserves Groups.

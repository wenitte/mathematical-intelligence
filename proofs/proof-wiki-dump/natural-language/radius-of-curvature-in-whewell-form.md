Theorem
Let $C$ be a curve defined by a real function which is twice differentiable.
The radius of curvature $\kappa$ of $C$ at a point $P$ can be expressed in the form of a Whewell equation as:

$\rho = \size {\dfrac {\d s} {\d \psi} }$
where:

$s$ is the arc length of $C$
$\psi$ is the turning angle of $C$
$\size {\, \cdot \,}$ denotes the absolute value function.


Proof
By definition, the radius of curvature $\rho$ is given by:

$\rho = \dfrac 1 {\size \kappa}$
where $\kappa$ is the curvature, given in Whewell form as:

$\kappa = \dfrac {\d \psi} {\d s}$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
A straight line $\LL$ is the set of all $\tuple {x, y} \in \R^2$, where:

$\alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 y = \beta$
where $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \beta \in \R$ are given, and not both $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$ are zero.


Proof
Let $y = \map f x$ be the equation of a straight line $\LL$.
From Line in Plane is Straight iff Slope is Constant, $\LL$ has constant slope.
Thus the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ will be of the form:

$y' = c$
Thus:














\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \int c \rd x\)





Fundamental Theorem of Calculus














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds c x + K\)





Primitive of Constant



where $K$ is arbitrary.

Taking the equation:

$\alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 y = \beta$
it can be seen that this can be expressed as:

$y = -\dfrac {\alpha_1} {\alpha_2} x + \dfrac {\beta} {\alpha_2}$
thus demonstrating that $\alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 y = \beta$ is of the form $y = c x + K$ for some $c, K \in \R$.

Also presented as
Some sources give the general equation of the straight line in the plane as:

$a x + b y + c = 0$
where $a, b, c \in \R$ are given, and not both $a, b$ are zero.
Its equivalence to the given form can be seen by equating $a = \alpha_1, b = \alpha_2, c = -\beta$.

Similarly equivalent forms include:

$a x = b y + c$
and so on.


Also known as
Some sources refer to the general equation of the straight line in the plane as a general equation of the first degree, but that entity is usually defined for a $n$ variables for general $n \in \N$.

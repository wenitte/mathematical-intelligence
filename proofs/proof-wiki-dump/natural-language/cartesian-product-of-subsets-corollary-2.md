Corollary to Cartesian Product of Subsets
Let $A, S, T$ be sets such that $S \subseteq T$.

Then:

$A \times S \subseteq A \times T$


Proof
From Set is Subset of Itself we have $A \subseteq A$.
From Cartesian Product of Subsets:

$A \subseteq A \land S \subseteq T \implies A \times S \subseteq A \times T$
$\blacksquare$

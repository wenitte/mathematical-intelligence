Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be the Arens-Fort space.
Let $q \in S: q \ne \tuple {0, 0}$.

Then $q$ is an isolated point of $T$.


Proof
If $q \ne \tuple {0, 0}$ then from Clopen Points in Arens-Fort Space we have that $\set q$ is both closed and open in $T$.
In particular, $\set q$ is open in $T$.
The result follows from Point in Topological Space is Open iff Isolated.
$\blacksquare$

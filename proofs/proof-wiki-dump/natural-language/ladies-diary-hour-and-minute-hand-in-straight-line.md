Puzzle
"Being at so large a distance from the dial-plate of a great clock, that I could not distinguish the figures;
but as the hour and minute hands were very bright and glaring,"
the correspondent noted that they were in a straight line and pointing upwards to the right.
It was evening.
What was the time?


Solution
$5 \frac 5 {11}$ minutes, or approximately $5$ minutes and $27$ seconds, past $7$.


Proof
Let it be assumed from the description of the general direction of the hands, and the fact that it is evening, that it is some short time after $7$ p.m.
Thus the hour hand is pointing a little way past the $7$.
Hence the minute hand is pointing a little way past the $1$.

Let $x$ be the number of minutes after $7$ that it is.
Let $\theta$ be the angle made by the hands of the clock from the vertical at that time.

The minute hand rotates at $1$ revolution every $60$ minutes.
That is, $\dfrac {360 \degrees} {60} = 6 \degrees$ per minute.

The hour hand rotates at $1$ revolution every $12$ hours.
That is, $\dfrac {360 \degrees} {12 \times 60} = \dfrac 1 2 \degrees$ per minute.
But at $7$, the hour hand is already at $\dfrac {360 \degrees} {12} = 30 \degrees$ from the vertical.
Thus:














\(\ds \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac x 2 + 30\)





angle of hour hand














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 x\)





angle of minute hand








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {\paren {12 - 1} x} 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 30\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {60} {11}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 \tfrac 5 {11}\)









So it is $5 \frac 5 {11}$ minutes past $7$.
$\dfrac 5 {11}$ minutes is $\dfrac {5 \times 60} {11}$ seconds, which evaluates to $27.\dot 2 \dot 7$ seconds.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space.
Let $M$ be countably compact.

Then $M$ is compact.


Proof
This follows directly from:

Metric Space is First-Countable
Countably Compact First-Countable Space is Sequentially Compact
Sequentially Compact Metric Space is Second-Countable
Second-Countable Space is Compact iff Countably Compact
$\blacksquare$


Axiom of Countable Choice
This theorem depends on the Axiom of Countable Choice, by way of Sequentially Compact Metric Space is Second-Countable.
Although not as strong as the Axiom of Choice, the Axiom of Countable Choice is similarly independent of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms.
As such, mathematicians are generally convinced of its truth and believe that it should be generally accepted.

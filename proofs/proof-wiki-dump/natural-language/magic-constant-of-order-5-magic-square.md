Theorem
The magic constant of the order $5$ magic square is $65$.


Proof 1
Let $M_5$ denote an order $5$ magic square
By Sum of Terms of Magic Square, the total of all the entries in $M_5$ is given by:

$T_5 = \dfrac {5^2 \paren {5^2 + 1} } 2 = \dfrac {25 \times 26} 2 = 325$
As there are $5$ rows of $M_5$, the magic constant of $M_5$ is given by:

$S_5 = \dfrac {325} 5 = 65$
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Let $M_n$ denote the magic square of order $n$.
By Magic Constant of Magic Square, the magic constant of $M_n$ is given by:

$S_n = \dfrac {n \left({n^2 + 1}\right)} 2$
Setting $n = 5$:

$S_5 = \dfrac {5 \times 26} 2 = 65$
$\blacksquare$

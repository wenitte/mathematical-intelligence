Theorem
The first order quasilinear ordinary differential equation over the real numbers $\R$:

$x + y y' = 0$
has the general solution:

$x^2 + y^2 = C$
where:

$C > 0$
$y \ne 0$
$x < \size {\sqrt C}$
with the singular point:

$x = y = 0$


Proof
Observe that from Derivative of Power and Chain Rule for Derivatives:

$\dfrac {\map \d {x^2 + y^2} } {\d y} = 2 x + 2 y \dfrac {\d y} {\d x}$
Hence:

$\dfrac {\map \d {x^2 + y^2} } {\d y} = 0$
So from Derivative of Constant:

$x^2 + y^2 = C$
where $C$ is abitrary.
$\blacksquare$

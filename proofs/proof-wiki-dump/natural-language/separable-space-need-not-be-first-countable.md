Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is separable.

Then $T$ does not necessarily have to be first-countable.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a finite complement topology on an uncountable set $S$.
We have that a Finite Complement Topology is Separable.
But we also have that an Uncountable Finite Complement Space is not First-Countable.
Hence the result, by Proof by Counterexample.
$\blacksquare$

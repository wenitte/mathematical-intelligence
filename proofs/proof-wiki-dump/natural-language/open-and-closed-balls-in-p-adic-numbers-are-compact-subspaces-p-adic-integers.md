Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers.

Then the set of $p$-adic integers $\Z_p$ is compact.


Proof
By definition the $p$-adic integers $\Z_p$ is the closed ball $\map {B^-_1} 0$.
From Open and Closed Balls in P-adic Numbers are Compact Subspaces, $\map {B^-_1} 0$ is compact.
$\blacksquare$

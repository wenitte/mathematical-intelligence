Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be an acute triangle.
Let $\triangle DEF$ be the orthic triangle of $\triangle ABC$ such that:

$D$ is on $BC$
$E$ is on $AC$
$F$ is on $AB$
Then:

the excenter of $\triangle DEF$ with respect to $EF$ is $A$
the excenter of $\triangle DEF$ with respect to $DF$ is $B$
the excenter of $\triangle DEF$ with respect to $DE$ is $C$
and:

the incenter of $\triangle DEF$ is the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$.


Proof

From Altitudes of Triangle Bisect Angles of Orthic Triangle, $AD$ is the angle bisector of $\angle FDE$.
From Bisectors of Adjacent Angles between Straight Lines Meeting at Point are Perpendicular, the angle bisector of $\angle PDE$ is perpendicular to $AD$.
The line perpendicular to $AD$ is $BC$.

Similarly, from Altitudes of Triangle Bisect Angles of Orthic Triangle, $BE$ is the angle bisector of $\angle FED$.
From Bisectors of Adjacent Angles between Straight Lines Meeting at Point are Perpendicular, the angle bisector of $\angle DEQ$ is perpendicular to $BE$.
The line perpendicular to $BE$ is $AC$.

From Construction of Excircle to Triangle, the intersection of $AC$ and $BC$ is the excenter of $\triangle DEF$ with respect to $DE$.

The same argument can be used mutatis mutandis to demonstrate the locations of the excenter of $\triangle DEF$ with respect to $DF$ and $EF$.

From Altitudes of Triangle Bisect Angles of Orthic Triangle:

$AD$ is the angle bisector of $\angle FDE$
$BE$ is the angle bisector of $\angle DEF$
$FC$ is the angle bisector of $\angle EFD$
From Line from Vertex of Triangle to Incenter is Angle Bisector it follows that $H$ is the incenter of $\triangle DEF$.

Theorem
Let $G$ a group.
Let $\phi: G \to G$ be a (group) automorphism on $G$.
Then $\phi$ is a group endomorphism.


Proof
By definition of group automorphism and group isomorphism,
$\phi$ is a (bijective) group homomorphism on itself.
Hence, by definition of group endomorphism, $\phi$ is an group endomorphism.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Derivative of Composite Function
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sqrt {x^2 + 1} } = \dfrac x {\sqrt {x^2 + 1} }$


Proof
Let $u = x^2 + 1$.
Let $y = u^{1/2}$.
Thus we have:

$y = \sqrt {x^2 + 1}$
and so:














\(\ds \dfrac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\d y} {\d u} \dfrac {\d u} {\d x}\)





Derivative of Composite Function














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {2 \sqrt u} \paren {\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {x^2} + \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } 1}\)





Power Rule for Derivatives, Sum Rule for Derivatives














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {2 \sqrt u} \paren {2 x}\)





Power Rule for Derivatives, Derivative of Constant














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac x {\sqrt {x^2 + 1} }\)

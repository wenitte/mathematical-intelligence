Example of Primitive Semiperfect Number
$770$ is a primitive semiperfect number:

$1 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 14 + 35 + 55 + 70 + 77 + 110 + 385 = 770$


Proof
First it is demonstrated that $770$ is semiperfect.
The aliquot parts of $770$ are enumerated at $\sigma_0$ of $770$:

$1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 14, 22, 35, 55, 70, 77, 110, 154, 385$
$770$ is the sum of a subset of its aliquot parts:

$1 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 14 + 35 + 55 + 70 + 77 + 110 + 385$
Thus $770$ is semiperfect by definition.

By inspecting the divisor sums of each of those aliquot parts, they are seen to be deficient except for $70$.
By Semiperfect Number is not Deficient, none of the deficient aliquot parts are themselves semiperfect.
As for $70$ itself, it is seen to be a weird number.
So, by definition, $70$ is not semiperfect.
Hence the result, by definition of primitive semiperfect number.

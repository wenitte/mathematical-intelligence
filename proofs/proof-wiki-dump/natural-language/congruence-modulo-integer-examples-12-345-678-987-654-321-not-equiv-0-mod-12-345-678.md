Example of Non-Congruence Modulo an Integer
$12 \, 345 \, 678 \, 987 \, 654 \, 321 \not \equiv 0 \pmod {12 \, 345 \, 678}$


Proof
We have that $12 \, 345 \, 678$ ends in $8$.
Thus by Divisibility by 2, $12 \, 345 \, 678$ has $2$ as a divisor.
But $12 \, 345 \, 678 \, 987 \, 654 \, 321$ ends in $1$.
Thus, also by Divisibility by 2, $12 \, 345 \, 678 \, 987 \, 654 \, 321$ does not have $2$ as a divisor.
By Divisor Relation is Transitive, it follows that $12 \, 345 \, 678$ is not a divisor of $12 \, 345 \, 678 \, 987 \, 654 \, 321$.
The result follows by definition of congruence and divisibility.
$\blacksquare$

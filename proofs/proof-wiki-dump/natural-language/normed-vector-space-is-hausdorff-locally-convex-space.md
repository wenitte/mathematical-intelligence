Theorem
Let $\GF \in \set {\R, \C}$. 
Let $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a normed vector space.

Then $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ is a Hausdorff locally convex space. 


Proof
From Normed Vector Space is Locally Convex Space, $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ can be viewed as the locally convex space $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$.
Now for $x \ne \mathbf 0_X$, we have: 

$\norm x \ne 0$
from Norm Axiom $\text N 1$: Positive Definiteness. 
So $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ is a Hausdorff locally convex space.

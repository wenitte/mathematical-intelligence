Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.

Then $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ is not compact.


Proof
We have:

Compact Space is Countably Compact
Real Number Line is not Countably Compact
Hence, as $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ is not countably compact, it follows that it is not compact.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $z_1, z_2 \in \C$ be complex numbers.
Let $L$ be a straight line through $z_1$ and $z_2$ in the complex plane.

$L$ can be expressed by the equation:

$\map \arg {\dfrac {z - z_1} {z_2 - z_1} } = 0$


Proof
Let $z$ be a point on the $L$.
Then:

$z - z_1 = b \paren {z - z_2}$
where $b$ is some real number.

Then:














\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {z - z_1} {z - z_2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map \arg {\frac {z - z_1} {z_2 - z_1} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \arg b\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





as $b$ is real



$\blacksquare$

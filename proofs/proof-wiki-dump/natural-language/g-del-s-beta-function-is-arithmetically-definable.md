Theorem
Let GÃ¶del's $\beta$ function $\beta: \N^3 \to \N$ be defined as:

$\map \beta {x, y, z} = \map \rem {x, 1 + \paren {z + 1} \times y}$
Then there exists a $\Sigma_1$ WFF of $4$ free variables:

$\map \phi {r, x, y, z}$
such that:

$r = \map \beta {x, y, z} \iff \N \models \map \phi {\sqbrk r, \sqbrk x, \sqbrk y, \sqbrk z}$
where $\sqbrk a$ denotes the unary representation of $a \in \N$.


Proof
Follows from:

Basic Primitive Recursive Functions are Arithmetically Definable
Addition is Arithmetically Definable
Multiplication is Arithmetically Definable
Remainder is Arithmetically Definable
Substitution of Arithmetically Definable Functions is Arithmetically Definable
$\blacksquare$

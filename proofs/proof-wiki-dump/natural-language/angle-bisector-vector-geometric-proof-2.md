Theorem
Let $\mathbf u$ and $\mathbf v$ be vectors of non-zero length.
Let $\norm {\mathbf u}$ and $\norm {\mathbf v}$ be their respective lengths.

Then $\norm {\mathbf u} \mathbf v + \norm {\mathbf v} \mathbf u$ is the angle bisector of $\mathbf u$ and $\mathbf v$.


Proof
The vectors $\norm {\mathbf u} \mathbf v$ and $\norm {\mathbf v} \mathbf u$ have equal length from Vector Times Magnitude Same Length As Magnitude Times Vector.
Thus $\norm {\mathbf u} \mathbf v + \norm {\mathbf v} \mathbf u$ is the diagonal of a rhombus.

The result follows from Diagonals of Rhombus Bisect Angles.

Physical Law
Let $B$ be a body made out of an electrically conducting substance.
Let $B$ be in the shape of a slab with two parallel surfaces $P_1$ and $P_2$.
Let $B$ be placed in an electric field $\mathbf E$ acting perpendicular to $P_1$ and $P_2$.

Then $B$ will develop a surface charge on both $P_1$ and $P_2$ of a polarity such as to oppose the electric field being applied.




Informal Explanation
When the electric field $\mathbf E$ is first applied, there exists a macroscopic electric field $\mathbf E'$ throughout $B$.
Under the influence of $\mathbf E$, the conduction electrons move by Coulomb's Law towards the positive source of $\mathbf E$ and away from the negative source of $\mathbf E$.

Hence the conduction electrons make $P_1$ and $P_2$ charged in the opposite polarity to the electric field at $P_1$ and $P_2$.
From Distribution of Macroscopic Electric Charge within Conductor, it is not possible for there to be different (macroscopic) electric fields throughout $B$.
Hence, away from the surfaces $P_1$ and $P_2$, there is no difference in electric charge throughout the interior of $B$.

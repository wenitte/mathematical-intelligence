Theorem
Let $a, b, c$ be real numbers in arithmetic sequence.
Let the common difference of this arithmetic sequence be $d$.
Then:

$b^2 - a c = d^2$


Proof













\(\ds b^2 - a c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b^2 - \paren {b + d} \paren {b - d}\)





Definition of Arithmetic Sequence: $a + d = b$, $b + d = c$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds b^2 - \paren {b^2 - d^2}\)





Difference of Two Squares














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds d^2\)









$\blacksquare$


Examples
Square of $102$
Consider the square of $102$.
Consider $102$ as a term in an arithmetic sequence:

$100$, $102$, $104$
whose common difference is $2$.
Then from the Jadhav Theorem:

$102^2 - 100 \times 104 = 2^2$
from which we have:

$102^2 = 100 \times 104 + 4 = 10404$


Square of $406$
Consider the square of $406$.
Consider $406$ as a term in an arithmetic sequence:

$400$, $406$, $412$
whose common difference is $6$.
Then from the Jadhav Theorem:

$406^2 - 400 \times 412 = 36^2$
from which we have:

$406^2 = 400 \times 412 + 36 = 164 \, 800 + 36 = 164 \, 836$

Theorem
Let $x, y, z \in \R_{\ne 0}$ be non-zero real numbers which are not all equal.
Then $\dfrac x y, \dfrac y z, \dfrac z x$ are also not all equal.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $\dfrac x y = \dfrac y z = \dfrac z x$.














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \dfrac x y = \dfrac y z = \dfrac z x\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds x^2 z = y^2 x = z^2 y\)





multiplying top and bottom by $x y z$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds x z = y^2, x y = z^2, y z = x^2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds x y z = y^3, x y z = z^3, z y z = x^3\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds x^3 = y^3 = z^3\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds x = y = z\)










This contradicts the assertion that $x, y, z$ are all unequal.
Hence the result by Proof by Contradiction.

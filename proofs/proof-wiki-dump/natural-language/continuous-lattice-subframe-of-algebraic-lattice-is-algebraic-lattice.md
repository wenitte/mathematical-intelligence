Theorem
Let $L = \struct {S, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a bounded below algebraic lattice.
Let $P = \struct {T, \precsim}$ be a continuous lattice subframe of $L$.

Then $P$ is algebraic lattice.


Proof
By definition of algebraic ordered set:

$L$ is up-complete.
By Up-Complete Lower Bounded Join Semilattice is Complete:

$L$ is a complete lattice.
By definition:

$P$ is closure system of $L$.
By Image of Operator Generated by Closure System is Set of Closure System

$\map {\operatorname {operator} } P \sqbrk S = T$
By Closure Operator Preserves Directed Suprema iff Image of Closure Operator Inherits Directed Suprema

$\map {\operatorname {operator} } P$ preserves directed suprema.
Thus by Image of Directed Suprema Preserving Closure Operator is Algebraic Lattice:

$P$ is an algebraic lattice.
$\blacksquare$

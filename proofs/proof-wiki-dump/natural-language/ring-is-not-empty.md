Theorem
A ring cannot be empty.


Proof
In a ring $\struct {R, +, \circ}$, $\struct {R, +}$ forms a group.
From Group is not Empty, the group $\struct {R, +}$ contains at least the identity, so cannot be empty.
So every ring $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ contains at least the identity for ring addition.
$\blacksquare$

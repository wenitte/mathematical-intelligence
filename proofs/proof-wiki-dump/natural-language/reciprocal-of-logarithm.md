Theorem
Let $x, y \in \R_{> 0}$ be (strictly) positive real numbers.

Then:

$\dfrac 1 {\log_x y} = \log_y x$


Proof













\(\ds \log_x y \log_y x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \log_y y\)





Change of Base of Logarithm














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \log_y x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {\log_x y}\)









$\blacksquare$


Also presented as
This result can also be seen presented as:

$\paren {\log_x y} \paren {\log_y x} = 1$


Examples
Logarithm Base $10$ of $2$
The reciprocal of $\log_{10} 2$ is $\log_2 10$.

Lemma to Euler Triangle Formula

Let the incenter of $\triangle ABC$ be $I$.
Let the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$ be $O$.
Let $OI$ be produced to the circumcircle at $G$ and $J$.
Let $CI$ be produced to the circumcircle at $P$.
Let $F$ be the point where the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ meets $BC$.
We are given that:

the distance between the incenter and the circumcenter is $d$
the inradius is $\rho$
the circumradius is $R$.
Then

$IP \cdot CI = \paren {R + d} \paren {R - d}$


Proof
$OI = d$
$OG = OJ = R$
Therefore:

$IJ = R + d$
$GI = R - d$
By the Intersecting Chords Theorem:

$GI \cdot IJ = IP \cdot CI$
Substituting:

$IP \cdot CI = \paren {R + d} \paren {R - d}$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $T_1 = \struct {S, \tau_1}$ and $T_2 = \struct {S, \tau_2}$ be topological spaces defined on the underlying set $S$.
Let $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ be non-comparable.

Then it may possibly be the case that $T_1$ and $T_2$ are homeomorphic.


Proof
A counterexample is demonstrated in Homeomorphic Non-Comparable Particular Point Topologies.
$\blacksquare$

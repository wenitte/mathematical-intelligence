Theorem
Let $C$ be a circle in the plane on center $O$.
Let the radius of $C$ be $r$.
Let $L$ be an arbitrary ray through $O$.
Let $P$ be an otherwise arbitrary point, but lying on $L$.
Let $TÂ : X \to Y$ be an inversive transformation with $C$ as the inversion circle. 
Then $O$ is the inversion center.
Then the image of $P$ under $T$ also lies on $L$.


Proof
Let $P'$ be the image of $P$ under $T$, with $P \ne O$.
By the definition of inversion:

$P'$ lies on $L$
We deal with $O$ separately.  By the definition of ray:

$O$ lies on $L$
In the words of Euclid:

A point is that which has no part.

A point has no length, it has no magnitude.
So we cannot compute $\dfrac {r^2} {OO}$ to find $O'$, the image of $O$.
But by the definition of inversion, the image of $O$ is the point at infinity.
By the definition the point at infinity lies on every infinite half-line through $O$.
Hence $O$ lies on $L$.
Therefore the image under $T$ of every point on $L$ lies on $L$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_{a, b} }$ be a modified Fort space.

Then $T$ is scattered.


Proof
We have that a modified Fort space is $T_1$.
We also have that a dense-in-itself subset of a $T_1$ space is infinite.
But from Isolated Points in Subsets of Modified Fort Space, we have that any subset of $T$ with more than two points has at least one isolated point.
So any dense-in-itself subset of $T$ must have an isolated point.
Hence the result, by definition of scattered space.
$\blacksquare$

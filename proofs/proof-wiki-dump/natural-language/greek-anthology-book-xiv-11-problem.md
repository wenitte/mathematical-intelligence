Problem
I desire my two sons to receive the thousand staters of which I am possessed,
but let the fifth part of the legitimate one's share exceed by ten the fourth part of what falls to the illegitimate one.


Solution
Let $s$ staters be the share received by the legitimate heir.
Then:














\(\ds \dfrac s 5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10 + \dfrac {1000 - s} 4\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4 s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20 \times 10 + 5 \times 1000 - 5 s\)





multiplying both sides by $20$ to clear fractions








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 9 s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5200\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {5200} 9\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 577 \frac 7 9\)










Thus the legitimate heir inherits $577 \frac 7 9$ staters, while the illegitimate one receives $1000 - 577 \frac 7 9 = 422 \frac 2 9$.

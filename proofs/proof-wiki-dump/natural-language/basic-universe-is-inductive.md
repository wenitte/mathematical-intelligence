Theorem
Let $V$ be a basic universe.
Then $V$ is an inductive class.


Proof
By definition of basic universe, $V$ is a class containing all sets as elements.
By the Axiom of the Empty Set:

the empty class $\O$ is a set.
Hence $\O$ is an element of $V$.
By the Axiom of Powers, if $x$ is a set, then $\powerset x$ is a set.
By definition of power set:

$\set x \subseteq \powerset x$
By the Axiom of Swelledness, $\set x$ is a set.
By the Axiom of Unions, if $x$ is a set, then $\bigcup x$ is a set.
Thus $x \cup \set x$ is a set.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The Gelfond-Schneider constant:

$2^{\sqrt 2}$
is transcendental.


Proof
From the Gelfond-Schneider Theorem:
If:

$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are algebraic numbers such that $\alpha \notin \set {0, 1}$
$\beta$ is either irrational or not wholly real
then $\alpha^\beta$ is transcendental.

From Rational Number is Algebraic:

$2$ is algebraic.
From Square Root of 2 is Algebraic of Degree 2:

$\sqrt 2$ is algebraic.
From Square Root of 2 is Irrational:

$\sqrt 2$ is irrational.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The question of the transcendental nature of the Gelfond-Schneider constant $2^{\sqrt 2}$ was raised in the context of the $7$th problem of the Hilbert $23$.
That the Gelfond-Schneider Constant is Transcendental was established in $1930$ by Rodion Osievich Kuzmin.
It was since determined to be a special case of the Gelfond-Schneider Theorem, established $\text {1934}$ – $\text {1935}$.

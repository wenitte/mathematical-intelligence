Theorem
Let $V$ be a vector space over $\R$ or $\C$, and let $L$ be a linear subspace of $V$.

Then $L$ is a convex set.


Proof
Let $x, y \in L, t \in \closedint 0 1$ be arbitrary.
Then, as $L$ is by definition closed under addition and scalar multiplication, it follows immediately that

$t x + \paren {1 - t} y \in L$
Hence $L$ is convex.

Theorem
Let $n \in \N_{> 0}$.
Let $T, T' \subseteq \R^n$ be compact convex subsets of real Euclidean $n$-space.

Then, $T$ is homeomorphic to $T'$.


Proof
By Boundary of Compact Convex Set with Nonempty Interior is Homeomorphic to Sphere:

$\partial T \sim \Bbb S^{n - 1}$
$\partial T' \sim \Bbb S^{n - 1}$
Thus, by Homeomorphism Relation is Equivalence:

$\partial T \sim \partial T'$
Hence, by Cones on Homeomorphic Spaces are Homeomorphic:

$C \partial T \sim C \partial T'$
But, by Compact Convex Set with Nonempty Interior is Homeomorphic to Cone on Boundary:

$T \sim C \partial T$
$T' \sim C \partial T'$
Therefore, by Homeomorphism Relation is Equivalence:

$T \sim T'$
$\blacksquare$

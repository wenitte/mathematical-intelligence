Theorem
Let $M = \struct {S, \mathscr I}$ be a matroid.
Let $I$ be an independent subset of $M$.
Let $C$ be a circuit of $M$.

Then:

$C \setminus I \ne \O$


Proof
By definition of matroid circuit:

$C$ is a dependent subset of $M$
From Set Difference of Matroid Dependent Set with Independent Set is Non-empty:

$C \setminus I \ne \O$
$\blacksquare$

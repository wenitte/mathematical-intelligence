Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Finite Cyclic Group are equivalent:

Definition $1$
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a cyclic group.

Then $\struct {G, \circ}$ is a finite cyclic group if and only if it is a finite group.

Definition $2$
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a cyclic group generated by $a \in G$.

Then $\struct {G, \circ}$ is a finite cyclic group if and only if:

$\exists n \in \N: a^n = e$


Proof
Definition $(1)$ implies Definition $(2)$
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a finite cyclic group by definition $1$.
Then by definition, $\struct {G, \circ}$ is both cyclic and finite.
By definition of cyclic group:

$G = \gen a$
for some $a \in G$.
Hence by definition of group generator:

$\forall n \in \N: a^n \in G$
As $G$ is finite:

$\exists r, s \in \N: a^r = a^s$
such that $r \ne s$.
Without loss of generality, suppose $r > s$.
Then:














\(\ds a^r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^s\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^{r - s}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{s - s}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^{r - s}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e\)





where $n = r - s$ and $a^0 = e$ by definition



Thus $\struct {G, \circ}$ is a finite cyclic group by definition $2$.
$\Box$


Definition $(2)$ implies Definition $(1)$
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a finite cyclic group by definition $2$.
Then, by definition:

$\exists n \in \N: a^n = e$
Again, by definition of cyclic group and group generator:

$\forall g \in G: \exists m \in \N: g = a^m$

By the Division Theorem:

$m = q n + r$
for some $q \in \N$ and $0 \le r < n$.
Thus:














\(\ds a^m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{q n + r}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a^n}^q a^r\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^q a^r\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^r\)









That is, every element of $G$ is in the form $a^r$ where $0 \le r < n$.
That is, there exist no more than $n$ elements in $G$.
Thus $\struct {G, \circ}$ is a finite cyclic group by definition $1$.

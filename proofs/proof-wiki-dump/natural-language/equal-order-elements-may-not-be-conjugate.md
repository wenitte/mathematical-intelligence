Theorem
Let $G$ be a group
Let $x, y \in G$ be elements of $G$ such that:

$\order x = \order y$
where $\order x$ denotes the order of $x$.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $x$ and $y$ are conjugates.


Proof
Consider the dihedral group $D_4$, whose group presentation is:

$D_4 = \gen {a, b: a^4 = b^2 = e, a b = b a^{-1} }$

We have that:

$\order {a^2} = 2$
and:

$\order b = 2$
but $a^2$ and $b$ are not conjugate to each other.
$\blacksquare$

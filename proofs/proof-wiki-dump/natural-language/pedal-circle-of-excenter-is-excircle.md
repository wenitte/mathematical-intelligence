Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
Let $H$ be an excenter of $\triangle ABC$.

Then the pedal circle of $H$ is the excircle of $\triangle ABC$ whose center is $H$.


Proof
Let $\EE$ denote the excircle of $\triangle ABC$ whose center is $H$.
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $\EE$ is not the pedal circle of $H$.
By definition, the sides of $\triangle ABC$ are tangent to $\EE$.
Hence from Line at Right Angles to Diameter of Circle: Porism, the line through $H$ to those point of tangency to $\EE$ are perpendicular to the sides.
Hence $\EE$ is the pedal circle of $H$ by definition.
Hence by Proof by Contradiction, the pedal circle of $H$ is the excircle of $\triangle ABC$ whose center is $H$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $A = \tuple {x_1, y_1}, B = \tuple {x_2, y_2}, C = \tuple {x_3, y_3}$ be points in the Cartesian plane.
Then:

$A$, $B$ and $C$ are collinear
if and only if the determinant:

$\begin {vmatrix}
x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\
x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\
x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\
\end {vmatrix}$
equals zero.


Proof
We have that:

$A$, $B$ and $C$ are collinear
if and only if:

the area of $\triangle ABC = 0$
if and only if:

$\dfrac 1 2 \size {\paren {\begin {vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\ \end {vmatrix} } } = 0$ (from Area of Triangle in Determinant Form)
if and only if:

$\begin {vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\ \end {vmatrix} = 0$
$\blacksquare$

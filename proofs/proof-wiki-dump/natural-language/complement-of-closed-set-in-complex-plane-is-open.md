Theorem
Let $S \subseteq \C$ be a closed subset of the complex plane $\C$.

Then the complement of $S$ in $\C$ is open.


Proof

\(\)







\(\ds \)





$S$ is closed














\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds \)





$\forall z \in \C: z$ is a limit point of $S \implies z \in S$

\(\quad\) Definition of Closed Set












\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds \)





$\forall z \in \C: z \notin S \implies z$ is not a limit point of $S$

\(\quad\) Rule of Transposition












\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds \)





$\forall z \in \C \setminus S \implies z$ is not a limit point of $S$

\(\quad\) Definition of Relative Complement












\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds \)





$\forall z \in \C \setminus S:$ there exists a deleted $\epsilon$-neighborhood $\map {N_\epsilon} z \setminus \set z$ of $z$ entirely in $S$

\(\quad\) Definition of Limit Point












\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds \)





$\C \setminus S$ is open in $\C$

\(\quad\) Definition of Open Set

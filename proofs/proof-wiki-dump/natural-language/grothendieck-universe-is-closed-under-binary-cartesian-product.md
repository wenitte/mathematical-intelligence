Theorem
Let $\mathbb U$ be a Grothendieck universe.
Let $u, v \in \mathbb U$.
Let $u \times v$ be the binary cartesian product of $u$ and $v$ realized as a set of ordered pairs in Kuratowski formalization.

Then $u \times v \in \mathbb U$.


Proof
From Binary Cartesian Product in Kuratowski Formalization contained in Power Set of Power Set of Union:

$u \times v \subseteq \powerset {\powerset {u \cup v} }$
Then:














\(\ds u \cup v\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \mathbb U\)

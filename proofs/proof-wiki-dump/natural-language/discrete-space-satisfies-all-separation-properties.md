Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \powerset S}$ be the discrete topological space on $S$.

Then $T$ fulfils all separation axioms:

$T$ is a $T_0$ (Kolmogorov) space
$T$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space
$T$ is a $T_2$ (Hausdorff) space
$T$ is a semiregular space
$T$ is a $T_{2 \frac 1 2}$ (completely Hausdorff) space
$T$ is a $T_3$ space
$T$ is a regular space
$T$ is an Urysohn space
$T$ is a $T_{3 \frac 1 2}$ space
$T$ is a Tychonoff (completely regular) space
$T$ is a $T_4$ space
$T$ is a normal space
$T$ is a $T_5$ space
$T$ is a completely normal space
$T$ is a perfectly $T_4$ space
$T$ is a perfectly normal space


Proof
We have that a Standard Discrete Metric induces Discrete Topology.
Then we use Metric Space fulfils all Separation Axioms.

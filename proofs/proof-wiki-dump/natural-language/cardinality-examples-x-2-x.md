Example of Cardinality
Let:

$S_3 = \set {x^2 - x: x \in S_1}$
where $S_1 = \set {-1, 0, 1}$.

The cardinality of $S_3$ is given by:

$\card {S_3} = 2$


Proof
The elements of $S_3$ can be found by calculation:















\(\ds \paren {-1}^2 - \paren {-1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 + 1\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)




















\(\ds 0^2 - 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0 + 0\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds 1^2 - 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 + 1\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)










Thus by definition of set:

$S_3 = \set {0, 2}$
Thus $S_3$ has $2$ elements: $0, 2$.
Hence the result by definition of cardinality.

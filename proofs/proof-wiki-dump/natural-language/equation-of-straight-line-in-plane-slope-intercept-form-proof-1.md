Theorem
Let $\LL$ be the straight line in the Cartesian plane such that:

the slope of $\LL$ is $m$
the $y$-intercept of $\LL$ is $c$

Then $\LL$ can be described by the equation:

$y = m x + c$

such that $m$ is the slope of $\LL$ and $c$ is the $y$-intercept.


Proof
Let $\LL$ be the straight line defined by the general equation:

$\alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 y = \beta$

We have:














\(\ds \alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \beta\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \alpha_2 y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y_1 - \alpha_1 x + \beta\)










\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac {\alpha_1} {\alpha_2} x + \dfrac {\beta} {\alpha_2}\)










Setting $x = 0$ we obtain:

$y = \dfrac {\beta} {\alpha_2}$
which is the $y$-intercept.
Differentiating $(1)$ with respect to $x$ gives:

$y' = -\dfrac {\alpha_1} {\alpha_2}$
By definition, this is the slope of $\LL$ and is seen to be constant.

The result follows by setting:














\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac {\alpha_1} {\alpha_2}\)




















\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\beta} {\alpha_2}\)

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a particular point space.
Let $x \in S$ such that $x \ne p$.

Then $x$ is a limit point of $p$.


Limit Points in Subset
Let $U \subseteq S$ such that $p \in U$.
Let $x \in S$ such that $x \ne p$.

Then $x$ is a limit point of $U$.


Proof 1
Let $U \in \tau$ be an open set of $T$.
Then by definition of $T$:

$p \in U$
That is, $U$ contains (at least) one point of $S$ which is distinct from $x$.
As $U$ is arbitrary, it follows that all open set of $T$ have this property.
The result follows by definition of the limit point of a point.

Proof 2
Follows directly from:

Particular Point Topology is Closed Extension Topology of Discrete Topology
Limit Points in Closed Extension Space
$\blacksquare$

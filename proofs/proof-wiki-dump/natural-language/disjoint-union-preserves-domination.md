Theorem
Let $I$ be an indexing set.
For all $i \in I$, let $A_i$ and $B_i$ be sets such that $A_i \preccurlyeq B_i$.
Here, $\preccurlyeq$ denotes domination.

Then:

$\ds \bigsqcup_{i \mathop \in I} A_i \preccurlyeq \bigsqcup_{i \mathop \in I} B_i$
where $\bigsqcup$ denotes disjoint union.


Proof
By definition of domination, for all $i \in I$, there exists an injection $\iota_i: A_i \to B_i$.
Thus the mapping $\ds \iotaÂ : \bigsqcup_{i \mathop \in I} A_i \to \bigsqcup_{i \mathop \in I} B_i$ defined by:

$\map \iota {x, i} = \tuple {\map {\iota_i} x, i}$
is an injection.

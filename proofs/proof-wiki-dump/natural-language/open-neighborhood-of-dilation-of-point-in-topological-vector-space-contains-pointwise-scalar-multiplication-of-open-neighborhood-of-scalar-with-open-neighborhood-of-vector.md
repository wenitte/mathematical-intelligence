Theorem
Let $K$ be a topological field.
Let $X$ be a topological vector space over $K$.
Let $\lambda \in K$ and $x \in X$. 
Let $U$ be an open neighborhood of $\lambda x$.

Then there exists an open neighborhood $D$ of $\lambda$ in $K$ and an open neighborhood $V$ in $X$ such that:

$D V \subseteq U$
where:

$D V = \set {\mu y : \mu \in D, \, y \in V}$


Proof
Equip $K \times X$ with the product topology.
From Box Topology on Finite Product Space is Product Topology, this is precisely the box topology.
Define $m : K \times X \to X$ by: 

$\map m {\mu, y} = \mu y$
for each $\tuple {\mu, y} \in K \times X$.
From the definition of a topological vector space, $m$ is continuous.
In particular, $m$ is continuous at $\tuple {\lambda, x}$.
Hence, there exists an open neighborhood $W$ of $\tuple {\lambda, x}$ such that: 

$m \sqbrk W \subseteq U$
From Basis for Box Topology and the definition of a topology generated by a synthetic basis, there exists an open neighborhood $D$ of $\lambda$ in $K$ and an open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ in $X$ such that:

$D \times V \subseteq W$
Then we have, from Image of Subset under Mapping is Subset of Image:

$m \sqbrk {D \times V} \subseteq m \sqbrk W \subseteq U$
Since:

$m \sqbrk {D \times V} = D V$
we have:

$D V \subseteq U$
$\blacksquare$

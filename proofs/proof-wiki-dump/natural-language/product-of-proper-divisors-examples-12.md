Example of Product of Proper Divisors
The product of the proper divisors of $12$ is $144 = 12^2$.


Proof
From Product of Proper Divisors:

$\map P n = n^{\map {\sigma_0} n / 2 - 1}$
where $\map P n$ denotes the product of the proper divisors of $n$.

From $\sigma_0$ of $12$:

$\map {\sigma_0} {12} = 6$
and so:

$\map P {12} = 12^{6 / 2 - 1} = 12^2 = 144$
$\blacksquare$

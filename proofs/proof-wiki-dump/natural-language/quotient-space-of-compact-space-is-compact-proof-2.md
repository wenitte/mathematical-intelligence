Theorem
Let $T = \struct {X, \tau}$ be a compact topological space.
Let $\RR \subseteq X \times X$ be an equivalence relation on $X$.
Then, the quotient space:

$T / \RR$
is compact.


Proof
Let $q_\RR$ be the quotient mapping induced by $\RR$.
By the definition of the quotient topology, $q_\RR$ is continuous.
Further, $T / \RR = q_\RR \sqbrk T$. 
From Continuous Image of Compact Space is Compact, $q_\RR \sqbrk T$ is compact. 
Hence $T / \RR$ is compact.

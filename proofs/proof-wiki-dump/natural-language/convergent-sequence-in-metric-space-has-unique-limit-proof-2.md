Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a sequence in $M$.

Then $\sequence {x_n}$ can have at most one limit in $M$.


Proof
We have that a Metric Space is Hausdorff.
The result then follows from Convergent Sequence in Hausdorff Space has Unique Limitâ€Ž.
$\blacksquare$

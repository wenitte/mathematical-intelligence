Theorem
$S \cup \paren {S \cap T} = S$


Proof 1













\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \paren {S \cap T} \subseteq S\)





Intersection is Subset














\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds S \cup \paren {S \cap T} = S\)





Union with Superset is Superset‎



$\blacksquare$


Proof 2













\(\ds x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds S \cup \paren {S \cap T}\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds S \lor \paren {x \in S \land x \in T}\)





Definition of Set Intersection and Definition of Set Union








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds S\)





Disjunction Absorbs Conjunction



$\blacksquare$


Also see
Intersection Absorbs Union, where it is proved that $S \cap \paren {S \cup T} = S$
These two results together are known as the Absorption Laws, corresponding to the equivalent results in logic.

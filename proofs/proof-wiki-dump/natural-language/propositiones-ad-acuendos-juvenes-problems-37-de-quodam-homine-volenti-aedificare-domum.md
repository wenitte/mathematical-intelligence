Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $37$
De Quodam Homine Volenti Aedificare Domum
A Man Wanting to Build a House
A man wanting to build a house contracted with $6$ builders,
$5$ of whom were master builders.
and the $6$th an apprentice,
to build it for him.
He agreed to pay them a total of $25$ pence a day,
the apprentice to get half the rate of a master builder.
How much did each receive a day?


Solution
Each of the master builders earns $4 \frac 6 {11}$ pence per day.
The apprentice earns $2 \frac 3 {11}$ pence per day.


Proof
Let $x$ pence denote the amount one master builder earns in one day.
Then we have:














\(\ds 5 x + \dfrac x 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 \times 25} {11}\)





simplifying














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \tfrac 6 {11}\)









It follows that the apprentice earns half that, that is $2 \frac 3 {11}$ pence, per day.
$\blacksquare$

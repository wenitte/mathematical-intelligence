Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $f, g :S \to \R$ be real-valued functions.
Let $f - g$ denote the pointwise difference of $f$ and $g$, that is, $f - g$ is the mapping defined by:

$\forall s \in SÂ : \map {\paren{f - g} } s = \map f s - \map g s$

Then:

$f - g = f + \paren{-g}$
where:

$-g$ denotes the pointwise negation of $g$
$f + \paren{-g}$ denotes the pointwise addition of $f$ and $-g$


Proof
We have:










\(\ds \forall s \in S: \, \)



\(\ds \map {\paren{f - g} } s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f s - \map g s\)

By definition of equality of mappings:

$f - g = f + \paren{-g}$
$\blacksquare$

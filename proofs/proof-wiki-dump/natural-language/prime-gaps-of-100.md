Theorem
The following pairs of consecutive prime numbers are those whose difference is $100$:

$\tuple {396 \, 733, 396 \, 833}, \ldots$

This article is complete as far as it goes, but it could do with expansion.In particular: Only know the first pair so far. Research needed to find the next one(s).You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by adding this information.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Expand}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Proof
Demonstrated by listing the prime gaps.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $N_1$ denote the edgeless graph with $1$ vertex.
Then $N_1$ is a tree.


Proof
By definition, a tree is a simple connected graph with no circuits.
$N_1$ is trivially connected graph.
As $N_1$ is edgeless, it has no edges.
But a circuit is a closed trail with at least one edge.
Hence the result.

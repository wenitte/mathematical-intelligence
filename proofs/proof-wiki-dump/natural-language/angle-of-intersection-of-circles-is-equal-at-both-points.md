Theorem
Let $\CC$ and $\CC'$ be circles whose centers are at $C$ and $C'$ respectively.
Let $\CC$ and $\CC'$ intersect at $A$ and $B$.

The angle of intersection of $\CC$ and $\CC'$ at $A$ is equal to the angle of intersection of $\CC$ and $\CC'$ at $B$.


Proof
Consider the two triangles $CAC'$ and $CBC'$.




By definition of radius:

$CA = CB$ and $C'A = C'B$















\(\ds CA\)

\(=\)







\(\ds CB\)





Definition of Radius of Circle














\(\ds C'A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds C'B\)





Definition of Radius of Circle








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \triangle CAC'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \triangle CBC'\)





Triangle Side-Side-Side Congruence








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \angle CAC'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle CBC'\)









The result follows from Angle of Intersection of Circles equals Angle between Radii.

Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If two similar plane numbers by multiplying one another make some number, the product will be square.
(The Elements: Book $\text{IX}$: Proposition $1$)


Proof
Let $a$ and $b$ be similar plane numbers.
From Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{VII} $: Multiples of Ratios of Numbers:

$a : b = a^2 : a b$
From Proposition $18$ of Book $\text{VIII} $: Between two Similar Plane Numbers exists one Mean Proportional:

there exists one mean proportional between $a$ and $b$.
From Proposition $8$ of Book $\text{VIII} $: Geometric Sequences in Proportion have Same Number of Elements:

there exists one mean proportional between $a^2$ and $a b$.
From Proposition $22$ of Book $\text{VIII} $: If First of Three Numbers in Geometric Sequence is Square then Third is Square it follows that:

$a b$ is square.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $1$ of Book $\text{IX}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $2$: Numbers whose Product is Square are Similar Plane Numbers.

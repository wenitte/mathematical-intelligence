Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space which is sequentially compact.

Then $M$ is complete.


Proof
Let $\sequence {x_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $A$.

As $M$ is sequentially compact, $\sequence {x_n}$ has a convergent subsequence.
By Convergent Subsequence of Cauchy Sequence in Metric Space, this implies that the entire sequence $\sequence {x_n}$ is convergent.
Hence, $M$ is complete.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\CC$ be a double napped right circular cone with apex $O$.
Let $\PP$ be a plane which intersects $\CC$ such that:

$\PP$ does not pass through $O$
$\PP$ is not perpendicular to the axis of $\CC$.
Let $\EE$ be the conic section arising as the intersection between $\PP$ and $\CC$.
Let $\SS$ and $\SS'$ be the Dandelin spheres with respect to $\PP$.
Then:

$\SS$ and $\SS'$ are tangent to $\PP$ at the foci of $\EE$.


Proof
Let $\SS$ and $\SS'$ be the Dandelin spheres with respect to $\PP$.
Let $P$ be a point on $\EE$.
Let $F$ and $F'$ be the points at which $\SS$ and $\SS'$ are tangent to $\PP$ respectively.
Let the generatrix of $\CC$ which passes through $P$ touch $\SS$ and $\SS'$ at $E$ and $E'$ respectively.
Because $PF$ and $PE$ are both tangent to $\SS$:

$PF = PE$
and similarly:

$PF' = PE'$


Proof for Ellipse
Let $\EE$ be an ellipse.




Then $E$ and $E'$ are on the same side of $O$, and so:

$PF + PF' = PE + PE'$
But $PE + PE'$ is a constant.
Hence $\EE$ fulfils the equidistance property with respect to the points $F$ and $F'$.
Hence $F$ and $F'$ are the foci of $\EE$.
$\Box$


Proof for Hyperbola
Let $\EE$ be a hyperbola.




Then $E$ and $E'$ are on the opposites sides of $O$, and so:

$PF - PF' = PE - PE'$
But $PE - PE'$ is a constant.
Hence $\EE$ fulfils the equidistance property with respect to the points $F$ and $F'$.
Hence $F$ and $F'$ are the foci of $\EE$.
$\Box$


Proof for Parabola
Let $\EE$ be a parabola.




Because $\PP$ is parallel to the generatrix of $\CC$, it follows that:

$\triangle PHE = \triangle PHE'$
and so:

$PF = PE'$
and it is seen that this is the focus-directrix property of the parabola.

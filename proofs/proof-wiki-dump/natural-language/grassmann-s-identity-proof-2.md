Theorem
Let $K$ be a division ring.
Let $\struct {G, +_G, \circ}_K$ be a $K$-vector space.
Let $M$ and $N$ be finite-dimensional subspaces of $G$.

Then the sum $M + N$ and intersection $M \cap N$ are finite-dimensional, and:

$\map \dim {M + N} + \map \dim {M \cap N} = \map \dim M + \map \dim N$


Proof
By the second isomorphism theorem:

$\dfrac {M + N} M \equiv \dfrac N {M \cap N}$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

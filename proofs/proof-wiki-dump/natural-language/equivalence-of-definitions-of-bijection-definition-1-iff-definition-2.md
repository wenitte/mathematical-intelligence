Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Bijection are equivalent:

Definition 1
A mapping $f: S \to T$ is a bijection if and only if both:

$(1): \quad f$ is an injection
and:

$(2): \quad f$ is a surjection.
Definition 2
A mapping $f: S \to T$ is a bijection if and only if:

$f$ has both a left inverse and a right inverse.


Proof
From Injection iff Left Inverse, $f$ is an injection if and only if $f$ has a left inverse mapping.
From Surjection iff Right Inverse, $f$ is a surjection if and only if $f$ has a right inverse mapping.
Putting these together, it follows that:

$f$ is both an injection and a surjection
if and only if:

$f$ has both a left inverse and a right inverse.

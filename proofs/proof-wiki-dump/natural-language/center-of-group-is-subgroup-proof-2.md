Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
The center $\map Z G$ of $G$ is a subgroup of $G$.


Proof
We have the result Center is Intersection of Centralizers.
That is, $\map Z G$ is the intersection of all the centralizers of $G$.
All of these are subgroups of $G$ by Centralizer of Group Element is Subgroup.
Thus from Intersection of Subgroups is Subgroup, $\map Z G$ is also a subgroup of $G$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
On a standard chessboard, it is possible to arrange a maximum of $8$ queens so that no queen is attacking any other queen.
There are $12$ such arrangements, up to rotation and reflection.

That there are only these $12$ can be proved by brute force.

$9$ queens cannot be so placed.
This is clear from the Pigeonhole Principle, which would have at least one row with $2$ queens on it, and so attacking each other.

Examples of Use of Condition for Straight Lines in Plane to be Parallel
Let $\LL_1$ be the straight line whose equation in general form is given as:

$3 x - 4 y = 7$
Let $\LL_2$ be the straight line parallel to $\LL_1$ which passes through the point $\tuple {1, 2}$.
The equation for $\LL_2$ is:

$3 x - 4 y = -5$


Proof
From Condition for Straight Lines in Plane to be Parallel, $\LL_2$ has an equation of the form:

$(1): \quad 3 x - 4 y = C$
We have that $\tuple {1, 2}$ is on $\LL_2$.
Hence substituting $x = 1$ and $y = 2$ into $(1)$:














\(\ds C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \paren 1 - 4 \paren 2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -5\)









Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

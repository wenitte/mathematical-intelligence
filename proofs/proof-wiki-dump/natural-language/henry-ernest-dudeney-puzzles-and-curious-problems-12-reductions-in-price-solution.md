Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $12$
Reductions in Price
"I have often been mystified," said Colonel Crackham, "at the startling reductions some people make in their prices,
and wondered on what principles they went to work.
For example, a man offered me a motor-car two years ago for $\pounds 512$;
a year later his price was $\pounds 320$;
a little while after he asked a level $\pounds 200$;
and last week he was willing to sell for $\pounds 125$.
The next time he reduces I shall buy.
At what price shall I purchase if he makes a consistent reduction?"


Solution
$\pounds 78 \tfrac 1 8$, or $\pounds 78, 2 \shillings 6 \oldpence$


Proof
The numbers:

$512, 320, 200, 125$ form a geometric sequence whose common ratio is $\dfrac 5 8$.
Hence the next reduction is expected to be $125 \times \dfrac 5 8 = \dfrac {625} 8 = 78 \tfrac 1 8$.
$\blacksquare$

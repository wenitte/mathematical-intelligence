Theorem
Let $\struct {F, +, \circ, \le}$ be a totally ordered field.

There is one and only one (ring) monomorphism from the totally ordered field $\Q$ onto $F$.
Its image is the prime subfield of $F$.


Proof
Follows from:

Characteristic of Ordered Integral Domain is Zero
Order Embedding between Quotient Fields is Unique.
$\blacksquare$

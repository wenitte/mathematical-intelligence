Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function which is continuous on the closed interval $\closedint a b$.

Then $f$ reaches a maximum and a minimum on $\closedint a b$.


Proof
This is an instance of the Extreme Value Theorem.
$\closedint a b$ is a compact subset of a metric space from Real Number Line is Metric Space.
$\R$ itself is a normed vector space.

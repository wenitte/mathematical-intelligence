Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Cyclic Group are equivalent:

Definition 1
The group $G$ is cyclic if and only if every element of $G$ can be expressed as the power of one element of $G$:

$\exists g \in G: \forall h \in G: h = g^n$
for some $n \in \Z$.

Definition 2
The group $G$ is cyclic if and only if it is generated by one element $g \in G$:

$G = \gen g$


Proof
$(1)$ implies $(2)$
Let $G$ be a Cyclic Group by definition 1.
Then by definition:

$(1): \quad g \in G$
$(2): \quad$ every element of $G$ is expressible as a power of $g$.
From $(1)$, it follows from Group Axiom $\text G 0$: Closure that:

$\gen g \subseteq G$
From $(2)$ it follows that:

$G \subseteq \gen g$
Thus:

$G = \gen g$
and $G$ is a Cyclic Group by definition 2.
$\Box$


$(2)$ implies $(1)$
Let $G$ be a Cyclic Group by definition 2.
Then by definition:

$G = \gen g$
Thus as $g^1 \in \gen g$

$g \in G$
and by definition of generator:

$\forall h \in \gen g: h = g^n$
for some $n \in \Z$.
Thus $G$ is a Cyclic Group by definition 1.
$\blacksquare$

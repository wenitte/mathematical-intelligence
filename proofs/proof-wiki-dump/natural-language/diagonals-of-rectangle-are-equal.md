Theorem
The diagonals of a rectangle are equal.


Proof

Let $ABCD$ be a rectangle.
The diagonals of $ABCD$ are $AC$ and $BD$.
Then $\angle ADC = \angle DAB$ as both are right angles by definition of rectangle.
By Rectangle is Parallelogram, $ABCD$ is also a type of parallelogram.
Thus by Opposite Sides and Angles of Parallelogram are Equal $AB = DC$.
Thus we have:

$AB = DC$
$\angle ADC = \angle DAB$
$AD$ is common to both $\triangle ADC$ and $\triangle DAB$
and so by Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence:

$\triangle ADC = \triangle DAB$
Thus:

$AC = BD$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The set of complex numbers under multiplication $\struct {\C, \times}$ forms a monoid.


Proof
Taking the monoid axioms in turn:


Monoid Axiom $\text S 0$: Closure
Complex Multiplication is Closed.
$\Box$


Monoid Axiom $\text S 1$: Associativity
Complex Multiplication is Associative.
$\Box$


Monoid Axiom $\text S 2$: Identity
Complex Multiplication Identity is $1$.
$\Box$

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The function $\map f x = \exp x$ is strictly increasing.


Proof
For all $x \in \R$:














\(\ds D_x \exp x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \exp x\)





Derivative of Exponential Function














\(\ds \)

\(>\)







\(\ds 0\)





Exponential of Real Number is Strictly Positive




Hence the result, from Derivative of Monotone Function.

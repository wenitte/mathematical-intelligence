Theorem
The set of complex numbers $\C$ is closed under addition:

$\forall z, w \in \C: z + w \in \C$


Proof
From the informal definition of complex numbers, we define the following:

$z = x_1 + i y_1$
$w = x_2 + i y_2$
where $i = \sqrt {-1}$ and $x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 \in \R$.
Then from the definition of complex addition:

$z + w = \paren {x_1 + x_2} + i \paren {y_1 + y_2}$
From Real Numbers under Addition form Group, real addition is closed.
So:

$\paren {x_1 + x_2} \in \R$ and $\paren {y_1 + y_2} \in \R$
Hence the result.

Example of Cardinality
Let:

$S_5 = \powerset \O$
where:

$\O$ denotes the empty set
$\powerset \O$ denotes the power set of $\O$.

The cardinality of $S_5$ is given by:

$\card {S_5} = 1$


Proof
By Power Set of Empty Set, we have that:

$\powerset \O = \set {\O}$
Thus $\powerset \O$ contains exactly $1$ element, that is: $\O$.
Hence the result by definition of cardinality.
$\blacksquare$

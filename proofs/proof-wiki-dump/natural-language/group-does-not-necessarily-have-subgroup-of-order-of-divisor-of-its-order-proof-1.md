Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite group whose order is $n$.
Let $d$ be a divisor of $n$.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $G$ has a subgroup of order $d$.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample:
Consider $S_5$, the symmetric group on $5$ letters.
By Order of Symmetric Group, $\order {S_5} = 5! = 120$.
We have that $120 = 8 \times 15$ and so $15$ is a divisor of $120$.
However, Symmetric Group on 5 Letters has no Subgroup of Order 15.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a set such that $S$ is equivalent to its cardinal.
If the axiom of choice holds, then this condition holds for any set.

Then:

$\card {\paren {\card S} } = \card S$
where $\card S$ denotes the cardinal number of $S$.


Corollary
Let $\NN$ denote the class of all cardinal numbers.
Let $x$ be an ordinal.

Then:

$x \in \NN \iff x = \card x$


Proof
By Condition for Set Equivalent to Cardinal Number:

$S \sim \card S$
Therefore, by Equivalent Sets have Equal Cardinal Numbers:

$\card S = \card {\paren {\card S} }$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be an algebraic structure.
Let $\circ$ be left cancellable and also commutative.

Then $\circ$ is also right cancellable.


Proof
Let $\circ$ be both left cancellable and commutative on a set $S$.
Then:














\(\ds a \circ c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b \circ c\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds c \circ a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c \circ b\)





$\circ$ is Commutative








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b\)





$\circ$ is Left Cancellable



$\blacksquare$

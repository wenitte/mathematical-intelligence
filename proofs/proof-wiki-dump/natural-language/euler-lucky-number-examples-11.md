Example of Euler Lucky Number
The expression:

$n^2 + n + 11$
yields primes for $n = 0$ to $n = 9$.

This demonstrates that $11$ is a Euler lucky number.


Proof













\(\ds 0^2 + 0 + 11\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0 + 0 + 11\)

\(\ds = 11\)



which is prime














\(\ds 1^2 + 1 + 11\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 + 1 + 11\)

\(\ds = 13\)



which is prime














\(\ds 2^2 + 2 + 11\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 + 2 + 11\)

\(\ds = 17\)



which is prime














\(\ds 3^2 + 3 + 11\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 + 3 + 11\)

\(\ds = 23\)



which is prime














\(\ds 4^2 + 4 + 11\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16 + 4 + 11\)

\(\ds = 31\)



which is prime














\(\ds 5^2 + 5 + 11\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25 + 5 + 11\)

\(\ds = 41\)



which is prime














\(\ds 6^2 + 6 + 11\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 36 + 6 + 11\)

\(\ds = 53\)



which is prime














\(\ds 7^2 + 7 + 11\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 49 + 7 + 11\)

\(\ds = 67\)



which is prime














\(\ds 8^2 + 8 + 11\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 64 + 8 + 11\)

\(\ds = 83\)



which is prime














\(\ds 9^2 + 9 + 11\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 81 + 9 + 11\)

\(\ds = 101\)



which is prime

Examples of Real Functions of Two Variables
Let $z$ denote the function defined as:

$z = y \sqrt {1 - x^2}$
The domain of $z$ is:

$\Dom z = \closedint {-1} 1 \times \R$


Proof
The domain of $z$ is given implicitly and conventionally.
What is meant is:

$z: S \to \R$ is the function defined on the largest possible subset $S$ of $\R^2$ such that:
$\forall \tuple {x, y} \in S: \map z {x, y} = y \sqrt {1 - x^2}$

From Domain of Real Square Root Function, in order for the real square root function to be defined, its argument must be non-negative.
Hence for $z$ to be defined, it is necessary for:














\(\ds 1 - x^2\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \size x\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds 1\)









So for $z$ to be defined, it must be that $-1 \le x \le 1$.
There are no such restrictions on the value of $y$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

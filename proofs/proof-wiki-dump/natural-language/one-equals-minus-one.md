Resolution
This is a falsidical paradox arising from incorrect reasoning about the nature of square roots.


Explanation
The property:

$\sqrt a \times \sqrt b = \sqrt {a b}$
can only be used when: 

$a \ge 0$ and $b \ge 0$
It is specifically false when both $a$ and $b$ are negative.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: The above is subtle enough to merit some proper analysis rather than just to rely on the bald statement. This would best be documented on a separate page.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.

Since $-1 < 0$, this property of square roots cannot be applied to this statement.

This is how the analysis is to go:














\(\ds -1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {-1} \sqrt {-1}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds i \sqrt 1 \cdot i \sqrt 1\)





as $\sqrt {-a}$ is defined as being $i \sqrt a$ for $a > 0$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {i \cdot i} \sqrt 1 \sqrt 1\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -1 \cdot 1\)





as $i^2 = -1$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -1\)









and all is well with the world.

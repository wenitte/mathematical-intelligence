Theorem
Let $M_1 = \struct {X_1, d_1}$, $M_2 = \struct {X_2, d_2}$ and $M_3 = \struct {X_3, d_3}$ be metric spaces.
Let $f: M_1 \to M_2$ and $g: M_2 \to M_3$ be continuous mappings.

Then their composite $g \circ f: M_1 \to M_3$ is continuous.


Proof
Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous mappings.
By definition:

$f$ is continuous at $a \in X_1$ for all $a \in X_1$
$g$ is continuous at $\map f a \in X_2$ for all $\map f a \in X_2$.
The result follows from Composite of Continuous Mappings at Point between Metric Spaces is Continuous at Point

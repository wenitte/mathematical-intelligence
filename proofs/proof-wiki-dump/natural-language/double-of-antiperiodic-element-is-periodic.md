Theorem
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be a real function.
Let $L \in \R_{>0}$ be an anti-periodic element of $f$.

Then $2 L$ is a periodic element of $f$.
In other words, every anti-periodic function is also periodic.


Proof
By Non-Zero Real Numbers Closed under Multiplication we have that $2 L \in \R_{>0}$.
Then:














\(\ds \map f {x + 2 L}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {x + \paren {L + L} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {\paren {x + L} + L}\)





Real Addition is Associative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\map f {x + L}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f x\)

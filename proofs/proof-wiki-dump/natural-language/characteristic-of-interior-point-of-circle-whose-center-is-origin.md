Theorem
Let $\CC$ be a circle of radius $r$ whose center is at the origin $O$ of a Cartesian plane.
Let $P = \tuple {x, y}$ be a point in the plane of $\CC$.

Then $P$ is in the interior of $\CC$ if and only if:

$x^2 + y^2 - r^2 < 0$


Proof
Let $d$ be the distance of $P$ from $O$.














\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {\paren {x - 0}^2 + \paren {y - 0}^2}\)





Distance Formula








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x^2 + y^2\)










Then by definition of interior of $\CC$:

$P$ is in the interior of $\CC$ if and only if $d^2 < r^2$
and the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

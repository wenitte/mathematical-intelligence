Porism to Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable
In the words of Euclid:

From this it is manifest that, if there be two numbers, as $D$, $E$, and a straight line, as $A$, it is possible to make a straight line [$F$] such that the given straight line is to it as the number $D$ to the number $E$.And, if a mean proportional be also taken between $A$, $F$, as $B$,as $A$ is to $F$, so will the square on $A$ be to the square on $B$, that is, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to that which is similar and similarly described on the second.But, as $A$ is to $F$, so is the number $D$ to the number $E$; therefore it has been contrived that, as the number $D$ is to the number $E$, so also is the figure on the straight line $A$ to the figure on the straight line $B$.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $6$ : Porism)


Proof
Apparent from the construction.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

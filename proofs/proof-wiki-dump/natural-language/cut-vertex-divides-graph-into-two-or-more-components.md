Theorem
Let $G$ be a graph.
Let $v$ be a cut-vertex of $G$.

Then the vertex deletion $G - v$ contains $2$ or more components.


Proof
By definition of cut-vertex, $G - v$ contains at least $2$ components.
That it can contain more components than $2$ is best proved by illustration:



$\blacksquare$

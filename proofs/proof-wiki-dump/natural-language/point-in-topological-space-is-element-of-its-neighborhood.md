Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $x \in S$.
Let $N$ be a neighborhood of $x$ in $T$.

Then $a \in N$.

That is:

$\forall x \in S: \forall N \in \NN_x: x \in N$
where $\NN_x$ is the neighborhood filter of $x$.


Proof
Trivially follows by definition of neighborhood of $a$.
$\blacksquare$

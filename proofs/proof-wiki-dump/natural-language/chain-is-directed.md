Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $C$ be a non-empty chain of $S$.

Then $C$ is directed.


Proof
Let $x, y \in C$.
By definition of connected relation:

$x \preceq y$ or $y \preceq x$
Without loss of generality, suppose that

$x \preceq y$
Define $z = y$.
Thus by definition of reflexivity

$x \preceq z$ and $y \preceq z$
Hence $C$ is directed.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Every ordinal is a transitive set.


Proof
Let $\alpha$ be an ordinal by Definition 1:
$\alpha$ is an ordinal if and only if it fulfils the following conditions:




\((1)\)  

$:$  



$\alpha$ is a transitive set   











  


\((2)\)  

$:$  



$\Epsilon {\restriction_\alpha}$ strictly well-orders $\alpha$   











  

where $\Epsilon {\restriction_\alpha}$ is the restriction of the epsilon relation to $\alpha$.

Thus $\alpha$ is a priori transitive.
$\blacksquare$

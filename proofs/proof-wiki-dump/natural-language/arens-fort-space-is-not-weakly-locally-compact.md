Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be the Arens-Fort space.

Then $T$ is not a weakly locally compact space.


Proof
We have that Neighborhood of Origin in Arens-Fort Space is not Compact.
So $\tuple {0, 0}$ is a point in $S$ which is not contained in a compact neighborhood.
Hence, by definition, $T$ is not weakly locally compact.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $x$ be a natural number in the form:

$\sqbrk {28 \underbrace {000 \cdots 0}_n 7}_{10}$
Then $x$ is divisible by $7$.


Proof
We have:














\(\ds \sqbrk {28 \underbrace {000 \cdots 0}_n 7}_{10}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \times \sqbrk {4 \underbrace {000 \cdots 0}_n 1}_{10}\)









and the result follows by definition of divisibility.
$\blacksquare$

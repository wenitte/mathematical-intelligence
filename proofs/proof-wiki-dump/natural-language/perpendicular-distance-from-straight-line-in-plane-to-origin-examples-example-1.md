Examples of Perpendicular Distance from Straight Line in Plane to Origin
Let $\LL$ be the straight line defined by the equation:

$a x - b y = 1$

The perpendicular distance $d$ from $\LL$ to the origin $\tuple {0, 0}$ is given by:

$d = \dfrac 1 {\sqrt {a^2 + b^2} }$


Proof
From Perpendicular Distance from Straight Line in Plane to Origin, $d$ is given by:

$d = \dfrac 1 {\sqrt {a^2 + \paren {-b}^2} }$
from which the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

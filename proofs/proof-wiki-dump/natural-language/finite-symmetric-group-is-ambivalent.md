Theorem
Let $n$ be a natural number.
Let $S_n$ be a symmetric group of order $n$.
Then $S_n$ is ambivalent.


Proof
The Conjugacy Classes of Symmetric Group are determined uniquely by the cycle type of the elements.
Since any element in $S_n$ is of the same cycle type with its inverse, they are in the same conjugacy class.
Hence they are conjugates of each other.
This implies that $S_n$ is ambivalent.

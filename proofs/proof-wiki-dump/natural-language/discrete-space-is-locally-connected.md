Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a discrete topological space.
Then $T$ is locally connected.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a discrete space.
From Discrete Space is Locally Path-Connected, $T$ is locally path-connected.
From Locally Path-Connected Space is Locally Connected, it follows that $T$ is locally connected.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\mathbf C$ and $\mathbf D$ be metacategories.
Let $F: \mathbf C \to \mathbf D$ be a functor.

Let $\mathbf B$ be the metagraph consisting of:

the collection of objects $\map F X$ for each object $X$ of $\mathbf C$
the collection of morphisms $\map F f$ for each morphism $f$ of $\mathbf C$

Then:

$\mathbf B$ with domains and codomains inherited from $\mathbf D$ is a metagraph
Proof
$\blacksquare$

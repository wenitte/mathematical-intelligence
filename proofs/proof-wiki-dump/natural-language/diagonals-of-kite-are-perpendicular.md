Theorem
Let $ABCD$ be a kite such that $AC$ and $BD$ are its diagonals.
Then $AC$ and $BD$ are perpendicular.


Proof


Let $AC$ and $BD$ meet at $E$.

Consider the triangles $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle CBD$.
We have that:

$AB = CB$
$AD = CD$
$BD$ is common.
Hence by Triangle Side-Side-Side Congruence, $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle CBD$ are congruent.

Consider the triangles $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle CBE$.
We have from the congruence of $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle CBD$ that:

$\angle ABE = \angle CBE$
$AB = CB$
and $BE$ is common.
Hence by Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence, $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle CBE$ are congruent.

We have that $AC$ is a straight line.
We have from the congruence of $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle CBE$ that:

$\angle BEC = \angle BEA$
From Two Angles on Straight Line make Two Right Angles, $\angle BEC + \angle BEA$ make two right angles.
Thus:

$2 \angle BEC = 2 \angle BEA = 2$  right angles
and so:

$\angle BEC = \angle BEA$ are both right angles.
That is, $AC$ and $BD$ are perpendicular.
$\blacksquare$

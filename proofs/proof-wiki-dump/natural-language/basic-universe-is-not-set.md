Theorem
Let $V$ be a basic universe.
Then $V$ is not a set.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $V$ were a set.
Then by the the Axiom of Swelledness, $V$ is swelled.
That is, as $V$ is a set, every subclass of $V$ would also be a set.
From Class has Subclass which is not Element, $V$ has a subclass $S$ which is not an element of $V$.
That is:

$\exists S \subseteq V: S \notin V$
But by definition of a basic universe, $V$ is a universal class.
That is:

$S \in V$
This contradicts the deduction that $S \notin V$.
Hence the result by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $x \in \R_{> 0}$ be a (strictly) positive real number.
Let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero integers.

Then:

$\sqrt [a] {\sqrt [b] x} = \sqrt [b] {\sqrt [a] x}$


Proof
Let $y = \sqrt [a] {\sqrt [b] x}$.
Then














\(\ds \sqrt [a] {\sqrt [b] x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y\)

\(\ds \sqrt [b] x\)

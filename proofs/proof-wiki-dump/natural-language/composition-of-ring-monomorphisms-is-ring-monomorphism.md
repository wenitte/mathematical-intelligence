Theorem
Let:

$\struct {R_1, +_1, \circ_1}$
$\struct {R_2, +_2, \circ_2}$
$\struct {R_3, +_3, \circ_3}$
be rings.
Let:

$\phi: \struct {R_1, +_1, \circ_1} \to \struct {R_2, +_2, \circ_2}$
$\psi: \struct {R_2, +_2, \circ_2} \to \struct {R_3, +_3, \circ_3}$
be (ring) monomorphisms.

Then the composite of $\phi$ and $\psi$ is also a (ring) monomorphism.


Proof
A ring monomorphism is a ring homomorphism which is also an injection.

From Composition of Ring Homomorphisms is Ring Homomorphism, $\psi \circ \phi$ is a ring homomorphism.
From Composite of Injections is Injection, $\psi \circ \phi$ is an injection.
$\blacksquare$

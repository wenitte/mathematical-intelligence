Theorem
The intersection of the power sets of two sets $S$ and $T$ is equal to the power set of their intersection:

$\powerset S \cap \powerset T = \powerset {S \cap T}$


Proof













\(\ds X\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \powerset {S \cap T}\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds X\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds S \cap T\)

\(\ds X\)

\(\ds S \land X \subseteq T\)

Theorem
A contradiction implies and is implied by the negation of a tautology:

$\bot \dashv \vdash \neg \top$
That is, a falsehood can not be true, and a non-truth is a falsehood.


Proof
We apply the Method of Truth Tables to the proposition.
As can be seen by inspection, the truth values in the appropriate columns match.
$\begin{array}{|c||cc|} \hline
\top & \neg & \bot \\
\hline
\T & \T & \F \\
\hline
\end{array}$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Consider two line segments $A$ and $B$ of equal length $a$ which are required to be the legs of an isosceles triangle $T$.
Then the area of $T$ is greatest when the apex of $T$ is a right angle.

The area of $T$ in this situation is equal to $\dfrac {a^2} 2$.


Proof

Let $\triangle OAB$ be the isosceles triangle $T$ formed by the legs $OA$ and $OB$.
Thus the apex of $T$ is at $O$.
Let $\theta$ be the angle $\angle AOB$.
We see that by keeping $OA$ fixed, $B$ can range over the semicircle $AOB$.
Thus $\theta$ can range from $0$ to $180 \degrees$, that is, $2$ right angles.
From Area of Triangle in Terms of Two Sides and Angle, the area $\AA$ of $T$ is:

$\AA = \dfrac 1 2 a^2 \sin \theta$
This is a maximum when $\sin \theta = 1$, that is, when $\theta$ is a right angle.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

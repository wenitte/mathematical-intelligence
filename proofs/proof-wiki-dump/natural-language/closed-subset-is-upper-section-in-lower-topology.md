Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \preceq, \tau}$ be a transitive relational structure with lower topology.
Let $A \subseteq S$ such that

$A$ is closed.

Then $A$ is an upper section of $S$.


Proof
By definition of closed set:

$S \setminus A$ is open.
By Open Subset is Lower Section in Lower Topology:

$S \setminus A$ is a lower section.
Thus by Complement of Lower Section is Upper Section and Relative Complement of Relative Complement:

$A$ is an upper section of $S$.
$\blacksquare$

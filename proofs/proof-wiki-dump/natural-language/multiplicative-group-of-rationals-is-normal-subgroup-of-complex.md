Theorem
Let $\struct {\Q, \times}$ be the multiplicative group of rational numbers.
Let $\struct {\C, \times}$ be the multiplicative group of complex numbers.

Then $\struct {\Q, \times}$ is a normal subgroup of $\struct {\C, \times}$.


Proof
From Multiplicative Group of Rationals is Normal Subgroup of Reals, $\struct {\Q, \times} \lhd \struct {\R, \times}$.
From Multiplicative Group of Reals is Normal Subgroup of Complex, $\struct {\R, \times} \lhd \struct {\C, \times}$.
Thus $\struct {\Q, \times} \le \struct {\C, \times}$.
From Non-Zero Complex Numbers under Multiplication form Infinite Abelian Group, $\struct {\C, \times}$ is abelian.
From Subgroup of Abelian Group is Normal it follows that $\struct {\Q, \times} \lhd \struct {\C, \times}$.

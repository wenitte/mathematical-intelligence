Theorem
Let $\phi: \struct {R_1, +_1, \circ_1} \to \struct {R_2, +_2, \circ_2}$ be a ring homomorphism.
Then $\phi: \struct {R_1, +_1} \to \struct {R_2, +_2}$ is a group homomorphism.


Proof
From the definition of a ring, both $\struct {R_1, +_1}$ and $\struct {R_2, +_2}$ are abelian groups.
The result follows from the definitions of ring homomorphism and group homomorphism.

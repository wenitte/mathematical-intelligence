Theorem
Let $\R^n$ be an $n$-dimensional real vector space.
Let $\norm {\, \cdot \,}_2$ be the Euclidean norm.

Then $\struct {\R^n, \norm {\, \cdot \,}_2}$ is a normed vector space.


Proof
We have that:

Real Vector Space is Vector Space
By Euclidean Space is Normed Vector Space, $\norm {\, \cdot \,}_2$ is a norm on $\R^n$
By definition, $\struct {\R^n, \norm {\, \cdot \,}_2}$ is a normed vector space.
$\blacksquare$

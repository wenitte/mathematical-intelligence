Theorem
Not all functions $f: \N \to \N$ are primitive recursive.


Proof
All primitive recursive functions are URM computable.
The set of $\mathbf U$ of URM programs is countably infinite.
The set of $\Bbb F$ of natural number functions is uncountably infinite.
Hence there is no surjection from $\mathbf U \to \Bbb F$.
Hence $\mathbf U \subsetneq \Bbb F$.
Hence $\exists f \in \Bbb F: f \notin \mathbf U$.
$\blacksquare$

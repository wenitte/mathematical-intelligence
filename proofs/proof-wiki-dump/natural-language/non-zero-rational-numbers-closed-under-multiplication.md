Theorem
The set of non-zero rational numbers is closed under multiplication.


Proof
Recall that Rational Numbers form Field under the operations of addition and multiplication.
By definition of a field, the algebraic structure $\struct {\Q_{\ne 0}, \times}$ is a group.
Thus, by definition, $\times$ is closed in $\struct {\Q_{\ne 0}, \times}$.
$\blacksquare$

Examples of Continuous Real Functions
Let $f: \R_{\ge 0} \to \R$ be the real function defined as:

$\map f x =  \sqrt x$
Then $\map f x$ is continuous at $x = 1$.


Proof
From Limit of Real Function: Example: $\sqrt x$ at $1$, we have that:

$\ds \lim_{x \mathop \to 1} \sqrt x = 1$

The result follows by definition of continuous real function.
$\blacksquare$

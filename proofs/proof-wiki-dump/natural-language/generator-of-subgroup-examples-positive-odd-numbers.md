Example of Generator of Subgroup
Let $A$ be the set of positive odd integers.
Let $\struct {\Z, +}$ be the additive group of integers.
The subgroup of $\struct {\Z, +}$ generated by $A$ is $\struct {\Z, +}$ itself.


Proof
From Generator of Subsemigroup: Positive Odd Numbers, the subsemigroup of $\struct {\Z, +}$ generated by $A$ is the semigroup of strictly positive integers under addition.
Then the set of integers $\Z$ is generated by $\struct {\Z, +}$ by various routes.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

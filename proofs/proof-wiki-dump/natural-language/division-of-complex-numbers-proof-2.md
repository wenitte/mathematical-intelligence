Theorem
Let $z_1 := a_1 + i b_1$ and $z_2 := a_2 + i b_2$ be complex numbers such that $z_2 \ne 0$.

The operation of division is performed on $z_1$ by $z_2$ as follows:

$\dfrac {z_1} {z_2} = \dfrac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2} + i \dfrac {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$


Proof













\(\ds \frac {z_1} {z_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {z_1 \overline {z_2} } {\cmod {z_2}^2}\)

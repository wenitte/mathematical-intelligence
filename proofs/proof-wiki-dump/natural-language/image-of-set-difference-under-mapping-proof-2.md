Theorem
Let $f: S \to T$ be a mapping.
The set difference of the images of two subsets of $S$ is a subset of the image of the set difference.

That is:
Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be subsets of $S$.
Then:

$f \sqbrk {S_1} \setminus f \sqbrk {S_2} \subseteq f \sqbrk {S_1 \setminus S_2}$
where $\setminus$ denotes set difference.


Proof













\(\ds y\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds f \sqbrk {S_1} \setminus f \sqbrk {S_2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)

\(\ds \exists x \in {S_1}: x \notin {S_2}: \, \)



\(\ds \tuple {x, y}\)

\(\in\)

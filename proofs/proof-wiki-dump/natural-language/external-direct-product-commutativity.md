Theorem
Let $\struct {S \times T, \circ}$ be the external direct product of the two algebraic structures $\struct {S, \circ_1}$ and $\struct {T, \circ_2}$.
Then:

$\circ_1$ and $\circ_2$ are commutative
if and only if:

$\circ$ is commutative.


Proof
Sufficient Condition
Let $\circ_1$ and $\circ_2$ be commutative operations.














\(\ds \tuple {s_1, t_1} \circ \tuple {s_2, t_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {s_1 \circ_1 s_2, t_1 \circ_2 t_2}\)





Definition of Operation Induced by Direct Product














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {s_2 \circ_1 s_1, t_2 \circ_2 t_1}\)





Definition of Commutative Operation














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {s_2, t_2} \circ \tuple {s_1, t_1}\)





Definition of Operation Induced by Direct Product



Thus $\circ$ is commutative.
$\Box$


Necessary Condition
Let $\circ$ be commutative. 
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose it is not the case that both $\circ_1$ and $\circ_2$ are commutative.
Without loss of generality, suppose $\circ_1$ is not commutative.
Hence:










\(\ds \exists s_1, s_2 \in S: \, \)



\(\ds s_1 \circ_1 s_2\)

\(\ne\)







\(\ds s_2 \circ_1 s_1\)





as $\circ_1$ is not commutative








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)

\(\ds \forall t_1, t_2 \in T: \, \)



\(\ds \tuple {s_1 \circ_1 s_2} \circ \tuple {t_1 \circ_2 t_2}\)

\(\ne\)







\(\ds \tuple {s_2 \circ_1 s_1} \circ \tuple {t_2 \circ_2 t_1}\)





Equality of Ordered Pairs








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)

\(\ds \forall t_1, t_2 \in T: \, \)



\(\ds \tuple {s_1, t_1} \circ \tuple {s_2, t_2}\)

\(\ne\)







\(\ds \tuple {s_2, t_2} \circ \tuple {s_1, t_1}\)





Definition of Operation Induced by Direct Product



This contradicts our assumption that $\circ$ is commutative.
The same argument can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to the case where $\circ_2$ is not commutative.

Hence, by Proof by Contradiction, $\circ_1$ and $\circ_2$ are both commutative.

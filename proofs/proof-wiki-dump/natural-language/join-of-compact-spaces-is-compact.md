Theorem
Let $A, B$ be compact topological spaces.
Then:

$A \ast B$ is compact
where $A \ast B$ denotes the join of $A$ and $B$.


Proof
By Closed Real Interval is Compact:

$\closedint 0 1$
is compact.
Thus, by Topological Product of Compact Spaces:

$A \times B \times \closedint 0 1$
is compact.
Therefore, by Quotient Space of Compact Space is Compact:

$A \ast B = \paren {A \times B \times \closedint 0 1} / \RR$
is compact.
$\blacksquare$

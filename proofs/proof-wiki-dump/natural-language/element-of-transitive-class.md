Theorem
Let $B$ be a transitive class.
Then:

$A \in B \implies A \subsetneq B$
where $\subsetneq$ denotes a proper subset).

By the definition of a transitive class:

$A \in B \implies A \subseteq B$

But $A \ne B$ because $\paren {A = B \land A \in B} \implies A \in A$, which by No Membership Loops is a contradiction.
Therefore $A \subsetneq B$.
$\blacksquare$

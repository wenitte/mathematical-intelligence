Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be a totally ordered set.
Let $I$ be an interval: be it open, closed, or half-open in $S$.

Then $I$ is convex in $S$.


Proof
Any interval can be represented as the intersection of two rays.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Obvious though it is, the above needs to be stated as a theorem in its own right.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Thus by Ray is Convex and Intersection of Convex Sets is Convex Set (Order Theory), $I$ is convex.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \precsim}$ be a preordered set.
Let $x, y \in S$ such that

$x \precsim y$

Then $\map \precsim y \subseteq \mathord {\map \precsim x}$
where $\map \precsim y$ denotes the image of $y$ under $\precsim$.


Proof
Let $z \in \mathord {\map \precsim y}$
By definition of image of element:

$y \precsim z$
By definition of transitivity:

$x \precsim z$
Thus by definition of image of element:

$z \in \mathord {\map \precsim x}$
$\blacksquare$

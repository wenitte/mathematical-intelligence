This page has been identified as a candidate for refactoring of advanced complexity.In particular: Going to restructure this entire argument: is or is not $\On$ an ordinal? as a philosophical position like AoC and LEM and so on. Not tonight, I need to mull it more.Until this has been finished, please leave {{Refactor}} in the code.
New contributors: Refactoring is a task which is expected to be undertaken by experienced editors only.

Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.
Theorem
The class of all ordinals $\On$ is an ordinal.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Does this not contradict Class of All Ordinals is Proper Class? Sorry, I now read the discussion page. But the current Definition:Ordinal requires an ordinal to be a set, so $\On$ isn't an ordinal. We need a scond definition of ordinal for this theorem.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Proof

The validity of the material on this page is questionable.In particular: This whole proof probably needs to be rewritten from scratch.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by resolving the issues.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Questionable}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
 This page is beyond the scope of ZFC, and should not be used in anything other than the theory in which it resides.
If you see any proofs that link to this page, please insert this template at the top.
If you believe that the contents of this page can be reworked to allow ZFC, then you can discuss it at the talk page.

The epsilon relation is equivalent to the strict subset relation when restricted to ordinals by Transitive Set is Proper Subset of Ordinal iff Element of Ordinal.
It follows that:

$\forall x \in \On: x \subset \On$

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: We have a problem here since $\On$ is a proper class. The notation $\in $ an $\subseteq$ can naturally be extended to classes, but one must be careful with their use.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
The initial segment of the class of all ordinals is:

$\set {x \in \On : x \subset \On}$

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: What is meant by $\subset$ here: $\subseteq$ or $\subsetneqq$? Initial segment makes no sense here because $\On$ is not a set.Sorry, but "makes no sense" is a bit strong: "initial segment" has been defined on $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ in the context of a well-ordered set, but the term makes perfect sense if defined in the context of a class.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
This class is equal to $\On$.
Therefore, by the definition of ordinal, $\On$ is an ordinal.
$\blacksquare$

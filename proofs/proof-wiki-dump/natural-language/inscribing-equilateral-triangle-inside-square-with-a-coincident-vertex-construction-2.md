Construction for Inscribing Equilateral Triangle inside Square with a Coincident Vertex
Let $\Box ABCD$ be a square.
It is required that $\triangle DGH$ be an equilateral triangle inscribed within $\Box ABCD$ such that vertex $D$ of $\triangle DGH$ coincides with vertex $D$ of $\Box ABCD$.


Construction

By Construction of Equilateral Triangle, let an equilateral triangle $\triangle DAI$ be constructed on $AD$ such that $I$ is inside $\Box ABCD$.
Bisect $\angle ADI$ and bisect it again towards $AD$ to cut $AB$ at $G$.
Construct $H$ on $BC$ such that $DH = DG$.
Then $DGH$ is the required equilateral triangle.


Proof
First a lemma:

Lemma
Let $\Box ABCD$ be a square.
Let $\triangle DGH$ be an isosceles triangle inscribed within $\Box ABCD$ such that the apex $D$ of $\triangle DGH$ coincides with vertex $D$ of $\Box ABCD$.


Then:

$\triangle DGH$ is equilateral triangle
if and only if:

$\angle ADG = 15 \degrees \text { or } \angle CDH = 15 \degrees$ (and in fact both are the case).
$\Box$

Because $\triangle DAI$ is equilateral, we have that:














\(\ds \angle ADI\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60 \degrees\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \angle ADG\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 15 \degrees\)





having bisected it twice




The result follows from the lemma.

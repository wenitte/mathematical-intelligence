Theorem
Let $\struct {F, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a valued field.
Let $\CC$ be the ring of Cauchy sequences over $F$.
Let $\NN$ be the set of null sequences in $F$.
That is:

$\NN = \set {\sequence {x_n}: \ds \lim_{n \mathop \to \infty} x_n = 0}$

Then $\NN$ is a maximal ring ideal of $\CC$.


Proof
By Null Sequences form Maximal Left and Right Ideal then $\NN$ is a maximal left ideal of $\CC$. 
A field is by definition a commutative ring.
In a commutative ring, a maximal left ideal is by definition a maximal ideal.
$\blacksquare$

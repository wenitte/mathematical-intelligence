Theorem
Let $P$ be an equilateral polygon with more than $3$ sides.
Then it is not necessarily the case that $P$ is also equiangular.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample
We take as an example the rhombus:

A rhombus is a parallelogram whose sides are all the same length.


Its angles may or may not all be equal.
$\blacksquare$

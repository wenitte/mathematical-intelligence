Theorem
The set of logical connectives:

$\set {\neg, \lor}$: Not and Or
is functionally complete.


This article is complete as far as it goes, but it could do with expansion.In particular: to adopt the notion of Independent Set of StatementsYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by adding this information.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Expand}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Proof
From Functionally Complete Logical Connectives: Negation and Conjunction, $\set {\neg, \land}$ is functionally complete.
That is: any expression can be expressed in terms of $\neg$ and $\land$.
From De Morgan's laws: Conjunction, we have that:

$p \land q \dashv \vdash \neg \paren {\neg p \lor \neg q}$
Thus all occurrences of $\land$ can be replaced by $\lor$ and $\neg$.
Thus any expression can be expressed in terms of $\neg$ and $\lor$.
That is: $\set {\neg, \lor}$ is functionally complete.
$\blacksquare$

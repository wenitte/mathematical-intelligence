Theorem


Let $A$ and $C$ be arbitrary points on a circle in the plane.
Let $M$ be a point on the circle with arc $AM = $ arc $MC$.
Let $B$ lie on the minor arc of $AM$.
Draw chords $AB$ and $BC$.
Find $D$ such that $MD \perp BC$.
Then:

$AB + BD = DC$


Proof

Given:

$MD \perp BC$
Find $E$ such that $BD = DE$ and draw $ME$
Then:

$MD$ is the perpendicular bisector of $BE$.
By Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence:

$\triangle MDB \cong \triangle MDE$
Let $H$ be a point such that arc $MH$ is equal to arc $BM$.
Label three angles for reference:
Let $\alpha = \angle MBC$.
Let $\beta = \angle MCB$.
Let $\gamma = \angle CMH$.
By the definition of congruence:

$\angle MBC = \angle MEB = \alpha$

By construction:

arc $AM$ = arc $AB$ + arc $BM$
Also by construction:

arc $MC = $ arc $MH + $ arc $HC$
Subtracting equals:

arc $AB = $ arc $HC$
In the words of Euclid:

In equal circles equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines.
(The Elements: Book $\text{III}$: Proposition $29$)

So:

$AB = HC$
By construction:

arc $HC$ subtends $\gamma$
By Inscribed Angle Theorem

$\angle MCH = \beta$
By construction:

arc $MHC$ subtends $\alpha$
Equating the results:

$\alpha = \beta + \gamma$

But $\alpha = \angle MEB$.
By External Angle of Triangle equals Sum of other Internal Angles:

$\alpha = \angle CME + \beta$
Subtracting:

$\angle CME = \gamma = \angle CMH$.
$MC$ is shared.
From above:

$\angle MCH = \angle MCB = \beta$

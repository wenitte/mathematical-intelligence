Theorem
Let $\Z \sqbrk {\sqrt 2}$ denote the set of quadratic integers over $2$:

$\Z \sqbrk {\sqrt 2} := \set {a + b \sqrt 2: a, b \in \Z}$
that is, all numbers of the form $a + b \sqrt 2$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers.

Then the algebraic structure:

$\struct {\Z \sqbrk {\sqrt 2}, +, \times}$
where $+$ and $\times$ are conventional addition and multiplication on real numbers, is an ordered integral domain.


Proof
We have that Quadratic Integers over 2 form Subdomain of Reals.
We also have that such numbers are real.
The result follows from Real Numbers form Ordered Integral Domain.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: So is a subdomain of an ordered integral domain always an ordered integral domain? Does this need to be proved?You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a metacompact space.
Then $T$ is a countably metacompact space.


Proof
From the definition, $T$ is metacompact space iff every open cover of $S$ has an open refinement which is point finite.
This also applies to all countable open covers.
So every countable open cover of $S$ has an open refinement which is point finite.
This is precisely the definition for a countably metacompact space.
$\blacksquare$

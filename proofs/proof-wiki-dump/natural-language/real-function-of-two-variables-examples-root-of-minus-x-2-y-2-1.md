Examples of Real Functions of Two Variables
Let $z$ denote the function defined as:

$z = \sqrt {-\paren {x^2 + y^2 + 1} }$
The domain of $z$ is:

$\Dom z = \O$
That is, there are no points of the Cartesian plane for which $z$ is defined.


Proof
The domain of $z$ is given implicitly and conventionally.
What is meant is:

$z: S \to \R$ is the function defined on the largest possible subset $S$ of $\R^2$ such that:
$\forall \tuple {x, y} \in S: \map z {x, y} = \sqrt {-\paren {x^2 + y^2 + 1} }$

From Domain of Real Square Root Function, in order for the real square root function to be defined, its argument must be non-negative.
Hence for $z$ to be defined, it is necessary for:














\(\ds -\paren {x^2 + y^2 + 1}\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 + y^2\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds -1\)









But:

$\forall x, y \in \R: x^2 + y^2 \ge 0$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

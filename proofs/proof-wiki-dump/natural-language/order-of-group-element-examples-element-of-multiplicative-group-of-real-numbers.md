Examples of Order of Group Element
Consider the multiplicative group of real numbers $\struct {\R_{\ne 0}, \times}$.
The order of $2$ in $\struct {\R_{\ne 0}, \times}$ is infinite.


Proof
From Real Multiplication Identity is One, the identity of $\struct {\R_{\ne 0}, \times}$ is $1$.
There exists no $n \in \Z_{\ge 0}$ such that $2^n = 1$.
Hence the result by definition of infinite order element.
$\blacksquare$

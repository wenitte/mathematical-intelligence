Theorem
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number.
Let $\floor x$ denote the floor of $x$.

Then:

$\floor {\floor x} = \floor x$

That is, the floor function is idempotent.


Proof
Let $y = \floor x$.
By Floor Function is Integer, $y$ is an integer.
Then from Real Number is Integer iff equals Floor:

$\floor y = y$
So:

$\floor {\floor x} = \floor x$
$\blacksquare$

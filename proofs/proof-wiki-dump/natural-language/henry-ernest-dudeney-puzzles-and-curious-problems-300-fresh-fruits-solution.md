Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $300$
Fresh Fruits
Some fresh fruit was being weighed for some domestic purpose.
It was found that the apples, pears and plums exactly balanced each other as follows:
One pear and three apples weigh the same as $10$ plums;
and one apple and six plums weigh the same as one pear.
How many plums alone would weigh the same as one pear?


Solution
One pear weighs the same as $7$ plums.


Proof
Let $a$, $p$ and $m$ denote the weights of one apple, one pear and one plum respectively.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds p + 3 a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10 m\)





One pear and three apples weigh the same as $10$ plums;




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds a + 6 m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds p\)





and one apple and six plums weigh the same as one pear.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a + 6 m + 3 a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10 m\)





substituting for $p$ from $(2)$ into $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 m\)





substituting for $a$ in $(2)$ and simplifying



$\blacksquare$

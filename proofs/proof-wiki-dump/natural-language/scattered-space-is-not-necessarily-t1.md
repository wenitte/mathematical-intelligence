Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a scattered topological space.
Then $T$ is not necessarily a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a non-trivial particular point space.
From Particular Point Space is Scattered, $T$ is a scattered space.
From Non-Trivial Particular Point Topology is not $T_1$, $T$ is not a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.
$\blacksquare$

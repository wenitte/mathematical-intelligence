This page has been identified as a candidate for refactoring of medium complexity.In particular: use this as an alternative definition for a basisUntil this has been finished, please leave {{Refactor}} in the code.
New contributors: Refactoring is a task which is expected to be undertaken by experienced editors only.

Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.

Theorem
Let $M$ be a unitary $R$-module.
Let $\BB = \family {b_i}_{i \mathop \in I}$ be a family of elements of $M$.
Let $\Psi: R^{\paren I} \to M$ be the morphism given by Universal Property of Free Module on Set.

Then the following are equivalent:

$\BB$ is a basis of $M$
$\Psi$ is an isomorphism


Proof
Follows directly from:

Characterisation of Linearly Independent Set through Free Module Indexed by Set
Characterisation of Spanning Set through Free Module Indexed by Set.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle whose sides are $a$, $b$ and $c$ opposite vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively.

Then the area $\AA$ of $\triangle ABC$ is given by:

$\AA = r s$
where:

$r$ is the inradius of $\triangle ABC$
$s = \dfrac {a + b + c} 2$ is the semiperimeter of $\triangle ABC$.


Proof

Let $I$ be the incenter of $\triangle ABC$.
Let $r$ be the inradius of $\triangle ABC$.
The total area of $\triangle ABC$ is equal to the sum of the areas of the triangle formed by the vertices of $\triangle ABC$ and its incenter:

$\AA = \map \Area {\triangle AIB} + \map \Area {\triangle BIC} + \map \Area {\triangle CIA}$

Let $AB$, $BC$ and $CA$ be the bases of $\triangle AIB, \triangle BIC, \triangle CIA$ respectively.
The lengths of $AB$, $BC$ and $CA$ respectively are $c, a, b$.
The altitude of each of these triangles is $r$.
Thus from Area of Triangle in Terms of Side and Altitude:














\(\ds \map \Area {\triangle AIB}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {c r} 2\)




















\(\ds \map \Area {\triangle BIC}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {a r} 2\)




















\(\ds \map \Area {\triangle CIA}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {b r} 2\)









Thus:

$\AA = r \dfrac {a + b + c} 2$

That is:

$\AA = r s$
where $s = \dfrac {a + b + c} 2$ is the semiperimeter of $\triangle ABC$.

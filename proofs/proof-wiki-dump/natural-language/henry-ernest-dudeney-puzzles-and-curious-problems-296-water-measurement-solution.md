Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $296$
Water Measurement
A maid was sent to the brook with two vessels that exactly measured $7$ pints and $11$ pints exactly.
She had to bring back exactly $2$ pints of water.
What is the smallest possible number of transactions necessary?


Solution
$14$ transactions are needed.


Proof
Let $V_7$ and $V_{11}$ denote the $7$-pint and $11$-pint vessels respectively.
In the below, the successive lines indicate the status of each of $V_7$ and $V_{11}$:

$\begin{array}{c|c} V_7 & V_{11} \\ \hline
7 & 0 \\
0 & 7 \\
7 & 7 \\
3 & 11 \\
3 & 0 \\
0 & 3 \\
7 & 3 \\
0 & 10 \\
7 & 10 \\
6 & 11 \\
6 & 0 \\
0 & 6 \\
7 & 6 \\
2 & 11 \\
\end{array}$
and it is seen that the required $2$ pints are in the $7$-pint vessel.
$\blacksquare$

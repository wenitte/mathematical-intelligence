Theorem
Let $S$ and $T$ be sets.

Then: 

$S \setminus T$ and $S \cap T$ are disjoint
where $S \setminus T$ denotes set difference and $S \cap T$ denotes set intersection.

Proof
From Set Difference Intersection with Second Set is Empty Set:

$\paren {S \setminus T} \cap T = \O$
and hence immediately from Intersection with Empty Set:

$\paren {S \setminus T} \cap \paren {S \cap T} = \O$
So $S \setminus T$ and $S \cap T$ are disjoint.
$\blacksquare$

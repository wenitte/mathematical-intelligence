The Garden Bed
A man has a triangular lawn of the proportions shown,
and he wants to make the largest possible rectangular flower-bed without enclosing the tree.



Solution
From Largest Rectangle Contained in Triangle, the largest rectangle that can be inscribed within a triangle is situated such that:

Two of its vertices lie on one side of the triangle
Its other two vertices bisect the other two sides of the triangle.

This solution works only if the tree is sufficiently close to the corner that it is not enclosed inside at least one of those largest rectangles.
$\blacksquare$

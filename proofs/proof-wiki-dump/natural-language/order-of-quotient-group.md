Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite group.
Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$.
Let $G / N$ be the quotient group of $G$ by $N$.

Then:

$\dfrac {\order G} {\order N} = \order {G / N}$
where $\order G$ denotes the order of $G$.


Proof
From Lagrange's Theorem:

$\dfrac {\order G} {\order N} = \index G N$
where $\index G N$ is the index of $N$ in $G$.
By definition of index:

$\index G N = \order {G / N}$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The identity element for the natural numbers under addition is zero ($0$):

$\forall n \in \N: 0 + n = n$


Proof
Take the definition of natural numbers $\N$ as a naturally ordered semigroup $\struct {\N, +, \le}$.
The result follows from Zero is Identity in Naturally Ordered Semigroup.
$\blacksquare$

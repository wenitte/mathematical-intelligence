Theorem
The following pairs of consecutive prime numbers are those whose difference is $10$:

$\tuple {139, 149}, \tuple {181, 191}, \tuple {241, 251}, \tuple {283, 293}, \ldots$
The sequence of the lower elements is A031928 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (N. J. A. Sloane (Ed.), 2008).


Proof
Demonstrated by listing the prime gaps.
$\blacksquare$

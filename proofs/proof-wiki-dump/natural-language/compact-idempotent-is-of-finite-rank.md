Theorem
Let $H$ be a Hilbert space.
Let $T \in \map {B_0} H$ be a compact linear operator.
Let $T$ be idempotent.

Then:

$T \in \map {B_{00} } H$
that is, $T$ is a bounded finite rank operator.

Let $\sequence {y_n}$ be a bounded sequence in the range of $T$. 
Since $T$ is idempotent:

$\forall n \in \N: T y_n = y_n$
Since $T$ is compact, $\sequence {T y_n}$ and hence $\sequence {y_n}$, contains a convergent subsequence.
Thus the range of $T$ has the Bolzano-Weierstrass property.
By Normed Vector Space is Finite Dimensional iff Unit Sphere is Compact/Sufficient Condition, the range has finite dimension.
$\blacksquare$

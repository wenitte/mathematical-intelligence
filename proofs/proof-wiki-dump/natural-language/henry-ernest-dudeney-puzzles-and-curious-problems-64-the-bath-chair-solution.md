Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $64$
The Bath Chair
A correspondent informs us that a friend's house at $A$, where he was invited to lunch at $1$ p.m., is a mile from his own house at $B$.
He is an invalid, and at $12$ noon started in his Bath chair from $B$ towards $C$.
His friend, who had arranged to join him and help push back, left $A$ at $12.15$ p.m., walking at $5$ miles per hour towards $C$.
He joined him, and with his help they went back at $4$ miles per hour, and arrived at $A$ at exactly $1$ p.m.
How far did our correspondent go towards $C$?


Solution
$\dfrac 2 3$ of a mile from $B$.
They met at $12:35$.


Proof
Let $d$ miles be the distance towards $C$ at which our correspondent encountered the friend.
Let $t$ hours past $12$ be the time at which they met at that point.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds d + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 \paren {t - \dfrac 1 4}\)





His friend ... left $A$ at $12.15$ p.m., walking at $5$ miles per hour towards $C$.




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds d + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \paren {1 - t}\)





... they went back at $4$ miles per hour, and arrived at $A$ at exactly $1$ p.m.''








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 t - \dfrac 5 4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 - 4 t\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 9 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {21} 4\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {21} {36} = \dfrac 7 {12}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \paren {1 - \dfrac 7 {12} }\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 5 3 - 1 = \dfrac 2 3\)









$\blacksquare$

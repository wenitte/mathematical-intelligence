Example of Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime
$\map {\sigma_1} {33} = 48$
where $\sigma_1$ denotes the divisor sum function.


Proof
We have that:

$33 = 3 \times 11$
and so by definition is a semiprime whose prime factors are distinct.

Hence:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {33}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {3 + 1} \paren {11 + 1}\)





Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 12\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 48\)

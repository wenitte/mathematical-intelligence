Theorem
Let $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n$ be non-empty sets.

Then their cartesian product $S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_n$ is non-empty.


Proof
We use mathematical induction.
The base case $n = 2$ is proved in Kuratowski Formalization of Ordered Pair, and the induction step follows directly from the definition of an ordered tuple.

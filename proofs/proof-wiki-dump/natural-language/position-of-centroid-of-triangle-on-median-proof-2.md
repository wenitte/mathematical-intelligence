Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
Let $AL$, $BM$ and $CN$ be the medians of $\triangle ABC$ meeting at the centroid $G$ of $\triangle ABC$.

Then $G$ is $\dfrac 1 3$ of the way along $AL$ from $L$, and similarly for the other medians.


Proof

Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
Let $AL$, $BM$ and $CN$ be the medians of $\triangle ABC$.
Let the medians be concurrent at the centroid, $G$.
By the definition of median, the sides of $\triangle ABC$ are bisected.

rearranging



Hence:

the distance from the vertex to the centroid is $2/3$ of the whole length of the median.
and so:

the distance from the centroid to the side is $1/3$ of the whole length of the median.

The result follows.

Corollary to Intersection with Complement is Empty iff Subset
$S \cap T = \O \iff S \subseteq \relcomp {} T$


Proof













\(\ds S \cap T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \O\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds S \cap \relcomp {} {\relcomp {} T}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \O\)





Complement of Complement








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds S\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds \relcomp {} T\)





Intersection with Complement is Empty iff Subset



$\blacksquare$

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $33$
Prosperous Business
A man started business with a capital of $\pounds 2000$, and increased his wealth by $50$ per cent every three years.
How much did he possess at the expiration of eighteen years?


Solution
$\pounds 22 \, 781, 5 \shillings$


Proof
Let $T$ be the total required.
We have:

$T = 2000 \times \paren {\dfrac 3 2}^6$
which evaluates to:

$T = 22 \, 781 \cdotp 25$
$\blacksquare$

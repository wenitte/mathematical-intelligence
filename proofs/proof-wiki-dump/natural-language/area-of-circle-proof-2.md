Theorem
The area $A$ of a circle is given by:

$A = \pi r^2$
where $r$ is the radius of the circle.


Proof
Proof by shell integration:
The circle can be divided into a set of infinitesimally thin rings, each of which has area $2 \pi t \rd t$, since the ring has length $2 \pi t$ and thickness $\rd t$.

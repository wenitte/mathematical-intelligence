Theorem
The set of rational numbers under multiplication $\struct {\Q, \times}$ forms a monoid.


Proof
Taking the monoid axioms in turn:


Monoid Axiom $\text S 0$: Closure
Rational Multiplication is Closed.
$\Box$


Monoid Axiom $\text S 1$: Associativity
Rational Multiplication is Associative.
$\Box$


Monoid Axiom $\text S 2$: Identity
Rational Multiplication Identity is $1$.
$\Box$

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

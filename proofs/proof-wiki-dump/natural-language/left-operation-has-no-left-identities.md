Theorem
Let $S$ be a set with more than $1$ element.
Let $\struct {S, \gets}$ be an algebraic structure in which the operation $\gets$ is the left operation.

Then $\struct {S, \gets}$ has no left identities.


Proof
From Element under Left Operation is Right Identity, every element of $\struct {S, \gets}$ is a right identity.
Because there are at least $2$ elements in $\struct {S, \gets}$, it follows that $\struct {S, \gets}$ has more than one right identity.
From More than one Right Identity then no Left Identity, it follows that $\struct {S, \gets}$ has no left identity.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers.
Let $a \in \Q_p$.
Let $\epsilon \in \R_{>0}$ be a strictly positive real number.
Let $\map { {B_\epsilon}^-} a$ be the closed $\epsilon$-ball of $a$ in $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$.

Then:

$a \in \map { {B_\epsilon}^-} a$


Proof
By definition, $\map { {B_\epsilon}^-} a$ is the closed $\epsilon$-ball of $a$ in the normed division ring $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$.
From Center is Element of Closed Ball in Normed Division Ring:
$a \in \map { {B_\epsilon}^-} a$
$\blacksquare$

Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $44$
De Salutatione Pueri ad Patrem
A Son's Greeting to his Father
A son greeted his father: "Hello Father;"
to which the father replied: "Hello Son.
May you live long, as much as you have lived.
If you triple that number and add one of my years,
you will have lived $100$ years."
How old was the boy at the time?


Solution
$16$ years and $6$ months.


Proof
Let $x$ years be the age of the boy at the time.
Then we have:














\(\ds 3 \paren {x + x} + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





$3$ times his age plus his age plus $1$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 99\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16 \tfrac 1 2\)









That is, $16$ years and $6$ months.
$\blacksquare$

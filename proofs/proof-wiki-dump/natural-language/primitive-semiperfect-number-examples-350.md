Example of Primitive Semiperfect Number
$350$ is a primitive semiperfect number:

$1 + 5 + 10 + 14 + 25 + 50 + 70 + 175 = 350$


Proof
First it is demonstrated that $350$ is semiperfect.
The aliquot parts of $350$ are enumerated at $\sigma_0$ of $350$:

$1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 25, 35, 50, 70, 175$
$350$ is the sum of a subset of its aliquot parts:

$1 + 5 + 10 + 14 + 25 + 50 + 70 + 175 = 350$
Thus $350$ is semiperfect by definition.

By inspecting the divisor sums of each of those aliquot parts, they are seen to be deficient except for $70$.
By Semiperfect Number is not Deficient, none of the deficient aliquot parts are themselves semiperfect.
As for $70$ itself, it is seen to be a weird number.
So, by definition, $70$ is not semiperfect.
Hence the result, by definition of primitive semiperfect number.

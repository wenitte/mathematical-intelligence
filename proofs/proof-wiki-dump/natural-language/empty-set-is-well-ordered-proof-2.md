Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\RR \subseteq S \times S$ be a relation on $S$.
Let $\O$ denote the empty set.
Let $\RR_\O$ denote the restriction of $\RR$ to $\O$.

Then $\struct {\O, \RR_\O}$ is a well-ordered set.


Proof
Let $V$ be a basic universe.
By definition of basic universe, $\O$ is an element of $V$.
By the Axiom of Transitivity, $\O$ is a class.
The result follows from Empty Class is Well-Ordered.
$\blacksquare$

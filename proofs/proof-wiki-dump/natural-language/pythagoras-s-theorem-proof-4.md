Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a right triangle with $c$ as the hypotenuse.
Then:

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$


Proof

Dissect the square on the left (which has area $c^2$) as shown.
Rearrange the pieces to make the two squares on the right, with areas $a^2$ and $b^2$.
$\blacksquare$


Source of Name
This entry was named for Pythagoras of Samos.


Historical Note
This proof was discovered by Bhaskara II Acharya.
As he is then reported as saying:

Behold!

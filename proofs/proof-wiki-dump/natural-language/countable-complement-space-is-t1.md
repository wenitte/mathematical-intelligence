Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a countable complement topology.

Then $T$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.


Proof
We have that the Countable Complement Topology is Expansion of Finite Complement Topology. 
We also have that a Finite Complement Space is $T_1$.
Then from Separation Properties Preserved by Expansion, we have that $T$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.

Theorem
Let $T$ be a topological space.
Then: 

$\partial_T \O = \O$
where $\partial_T \O$ denotes the boundary in topology $T$ of $\O$.


Proof
By Boundary is Intersection of Closure with Closure of Complement:

$\partial_T \O = \O^- \cap \relcomp T \O^-$
where $\O^-$ denotes the closure of $\O$.
By Closure of Empty Set is Empty Set:

$\O^- = \O$
Thus the result follows by Intersection with Empty Set.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $f: \N \to \C$ be a completely additive function.

Then $f$ is also additive.


Proof
Let $m, n$ be coprime integers.
Then in particular, $m, n \in \Z$.
Hence, since $f$ is completely additive:

$f \left({m \times n}\right) = f \left({m}\right) + f \left({n}\right)$
and $f$ is additive, as desired.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a monoid.
Let $e$ be an identity element of $\struct {S, \circ}$.

Then $e$ is a cancellable element of $\struct {S, \circ}$.


Proof
Let $x, y \in S$ such that $x \circ e = y \circ e$.

Then, by definition of identity element:

$x = x \circ e = y \circ e = y$
Thus $x = y$.
$\blacksquare$

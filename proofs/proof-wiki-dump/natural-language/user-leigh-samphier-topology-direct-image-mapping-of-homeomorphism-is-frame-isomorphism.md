Theorem
Let $T_1 = \struct{S_1, \tau_1}$ and $T_2 = \struct{S_2, \tau_2}$ be topological spaces.
Let $\map \Omega {T_1}$ and $\map \Omega {T_2}$ denote the frames of $T_1$ and $T_2$ respectively.

Let $fÂ : T_1 \to T_2$ be a homeomorphism between $T_1$ and $T_2$.
Let $f^\to$ denote the direct image mapping of $f$.

Then:

$f^\to \restriction_{\map \Omega {T_1}}$ is a frame isomorphism


Proof
$\blacksquare$

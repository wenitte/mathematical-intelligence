Theorem
Let $C$ be a class.
Let $C \ne \O$.
Then $C$ has an element of least rank.
That is:

$\exists x \in C: \forall y \in C: \map {\operatorname {rank} } x \le \map {\operatorname {rank} } y$
where $\map {\operatorname {rank} } x$ is the rank of $x$.

By Set has Rank, each element of $C$ has a rank.
Let $R$ be the class of ranks of elements of $C$.
$R$ is non-empty because $C$ is non-empty.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: This should follow from arbitrary intersections of ordinals being ordinals.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Since any non-empty class of ordinals has a least element, $R$ has a least element, $q$.
By the definition of $R$:

$\exists x \in C: \map {\operatorname {rank} } x = q$
Then $x$ is an element of $C$ of least rank.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
A sequentially compact metric space is separable.


Proof
This follows directly from:

Sequentially Compact Metric Space is Totally Bounded
Totally Bounded Metric Space is Separable.
$\blacksquare$


Axiom of Countable Choice
This theorem depends on the Axiom of Countable Choice, by way of Totally Bounded Metric Space is Separable.
Although not as strong as the Axiom of Choice, the Axiom of Countable Choice is similarly independent of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms.
As such, mathematicians are generally convinced of its truth and believe that it should be generally accepted.

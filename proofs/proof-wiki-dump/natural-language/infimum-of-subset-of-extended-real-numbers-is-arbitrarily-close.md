Theorem
Let $A \subseteq \overline \R$ be a subset of the extended real numbers.
Let $b$ be an infimum (in $\R$) of $A$.
Let $\epsilon \in \R_{>0}$.

Then:

$\exists x \in A \cap \R: x - b < \epsilon$


Proof
We have that:

$A$ is a a set of extended real numbers
$A$ is bounded below (in $\R$) as the real number $b$ is a lower bound for $A$.
From this follows by Infimum of Real Subset:

$\map \inf {A \cap \R} \in \R$ as $\inf A \in \R$

Let $\epsilon \in \R_{>0}$.
Then:














\(\ds \map \inf {A \cap \R}\)

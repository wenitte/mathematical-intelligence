Theorem
Let $\struct {R, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a normed division ring.
Let $\CC$ be the ring of Cauchy sequences over $R$.
Let $\NN$ be the set of null sequences.
Then the quotient ring $\CC / \NN$ is a division ring.


Corollary
Let $\struct {R, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a valued field.
Then the quotient ring $\CC \,\big / \NN$ is a field.


Proof
By Null Sequences form Maximal Left and Right Ideal then $\NN$ is an ideal of the ring $\CC$ that is also a maximal left ideal.
By Maximal Left and Right Ideal iff Quotient Ring is Division Ring then the quotient ring $\CC / \NN$ is a division ring
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\left({R, +, \circ}\right)$ be a ring.
Let $J$ be an ideal of $R$.

Then $\left({J, +}\right)$ is a normal subgroup of $\left({R, +}\right)$.


Proof
As $J$ is an ideal, $\left({J, +}\right)$ is a subgroup of $\left({R, +}\right)$.
By definition of a ring, $\left({R, +}\right)$ is abelian.

The result follows from Subgroup of Abelian Group is Normal.

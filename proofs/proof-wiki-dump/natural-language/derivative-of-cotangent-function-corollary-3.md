Corollary to Derivative of Cotangent Function
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\cot a x} = -a \paren {\cot^2 a x + 1}$


Proof













\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\cot x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\csc^2 x\)





Derivative of $\cot x$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\cot a x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -a \csc^2 a x\)





Derivative of Function of Constant Multiple














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -a \paren {\cot^2 a x + 1}\)

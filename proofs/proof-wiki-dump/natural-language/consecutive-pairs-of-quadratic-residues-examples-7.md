Examples of Consecutive Pairs of Quadratic Residues
There is $1$ consecutive pair of quadratic residues modulo $7$.
This is consistent with the number of such consecutive pairs being $\floor {\dfrac 7 4}$.


Proof
From Quadratic Residues modulo $7$:

$\set {1, 2, 4}$ are the quadratic residues modulo $7$
The only pair of consecutive quadratic residues is therefore $\set {1, 2}$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

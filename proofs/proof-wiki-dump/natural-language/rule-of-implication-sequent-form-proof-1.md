Theorem
The Rule of Implication can be symbolised by the sequent:














\(\ds \paren {p \vdash q}\)

\(\)







\(\ds \)














\(\ds \vdash \ \ \)





\(\ds p \implies q\)

\(\)







\(\ds \)











Proof
By the tableau method of natural deduction:


$\paren {p \vdash q} \vdash p \implies q$

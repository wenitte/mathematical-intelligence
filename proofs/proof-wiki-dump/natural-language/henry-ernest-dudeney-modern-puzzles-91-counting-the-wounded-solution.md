Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $91$
Counting the Wounded
When visiting with a friend one of our hospitals for wounded soldiers, I was informed that
exactly two-thirds of the men had lost an eye,
three-fourths had lost an arm,
and four-fifths had lost a leg.
"Then," I remarked to my friend, "it follows that at least twenty-six of the men must have lost all three -- an eye, an arm, and a leg."
That being so, can you say exactly how many men were in the hospital?


Solution
$120$ men are in the hospital.


Proof
We know that:

exactly two-thirds of the men had lost an eye.
We also know that:

three-fourths had lost an arm.
By Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, at least:

$\dfrac 2 3 + \dfrac 3 4 - 1 = \dfrac 5 {12}$
of the men had lost both an eye and an arm.

Similarly, since we know that:

four-fifths had lost a leg
by the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle again, at least:

$\dfrac 5 {12} + \dfrac 4 5 - 1 = \dfrac {13} {60}$
of the men had lost all three.
Dudeney equates this to $26$.
Hence there are exactly:

$26 \div \dfrac {13} {60} = 120$
men in this hospital.
$\blacksquare$

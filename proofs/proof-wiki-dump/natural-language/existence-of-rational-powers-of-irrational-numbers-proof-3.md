Theorem
There exist irrational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^b$ is rational.


Proof
Consider the equation:

$\left({\sqrt 2}\right)^{\log_{\sqrt 2} 3} = 3$

We have that $\sqrt 2$ is irrational and $3$ is (trivially) rational.

It remains to be proved $\log_{\sqrt 2} 3$ is irrational.
We have:














\(\ds \log_{\sqrt 2} 3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac{\log_2 3}{\log_2 \sqrt 2}\)





Change of Base of Logarithm














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac{\log_2 3}{1/2}\)





Logarithms of Powers: $\sqrt 2 = 2^{1/2}$ and $\log_2 2 = 1$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \, \log_2 3\)









From Irrationality of Logarithm, $\log_2 3$ is irrational.
Therefore $2 \, \log_2 3$ is irrational.
Thus there exist two irrational numbers $a = \sqrt 2$ and $b = \log_{\sqrt 2} 3$ such that $a^b$ is rational.
$\blacksquare$

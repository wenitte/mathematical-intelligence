Construction for Inscribing Equilateral Triangle inside Square with a Coincident Vertex
Let $\Box ABCD$ be a square.
It is required that $\triangle DGH$ be an equilateral triangle inscribed within $\Box ABCD$ such that vertex $D$ of $\triangle DGH$ coincides with vertex $D$ of $\Box ABCD$.


Construction

By Construction of Equilateral Triangle, let an equilateral triangle $\triangle ABN$ be constructed on $AB$ such that $N$ is inside $\Box ABCD$.
Let $AB$ be produced to $F$ such that $AB = BF$.
Draw an arc centred at $F$ with radius $FN$ to cut $AB$ at $G$.
Construct $H$ on $BC$ such that $DH = DG$.
Then $DGH$ is the required equilateral triangle.


Proof
It is necessary only to note that $N$ passes through $DH$, which is demonstrated in the simpler Construction 4.
Then the proof for that construction can be applied.

Theorem
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number such that $x > 0$.
Let $\ln x$ be the natural logarithm of $x$.

Then:

$\ln x \to -\infty$ as $x \to 0^+$


Proof
From the definition of natural logarithm:














\(\ds \ln x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \int_1^x \dfrac 1 t \ \mathrm dt\)









The result follows from Integral of Reciprocal is Divergent.

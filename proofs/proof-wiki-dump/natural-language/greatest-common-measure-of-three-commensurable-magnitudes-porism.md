Porism to Greatest Common Measure of Three Commensurable Magnitudes
In the words of Euclid:

From this it is manifest that, if a magnitude measure three magnitudes, it will also measure their greatest common measure.Similarly too, with more magnitudes, the greatest common measure can be found, and the porism can be extended.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $4$ : Porism)


Proof
Apparent from the construction.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Theorem
Let $n$ be a triangular number.

Then $49 n + 6$ is also triangular.


Proof
Let $n$ be triangular.
Then:

$\exists k \in \Z: n = \dfrac {k \paren {k + 1} } 2$
So:














\(\ds 49 n + 6\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 49 \frac {k \paren {k + 1} } 2 + 6\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {49 k^2 + 49 k + 12} 2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\paren {7 k + 3} \paren {7 k + 4} } 2\)









which is triangular.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
David M. Burton, in his Elementary Number Theory, revised ed. of $1980$, reports that the result If $n$ is Triangular then so is $9 n + 1$ was published by Leonhard Paul Euler in $1775$.
He published this along with If $n$ is Triangular then so is $25 n + 3$ and If $n$ is Triangular then so is $49 n + 6$.
There is an obvious pattern.

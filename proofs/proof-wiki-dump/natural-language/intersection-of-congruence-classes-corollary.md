Corollary to Intersection of Congruence Classes
Let $\RR_m$ denote congruence modulo $m$ on the set of integers $\Z$.

If $m \perp n$ then $\RR_m \cap \RR_n = \RR_{m n}$.


Proof
By Intersection of Congruence Classes:

$\RR_m \cap \RR_n = \RR_{\lcm \set {m, n} }$
$m \perp n$ means $\gcd \set {m, n} = 1$.
From Product of GCD and LCM it follows that $\lcm \set {m, n} = m n$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

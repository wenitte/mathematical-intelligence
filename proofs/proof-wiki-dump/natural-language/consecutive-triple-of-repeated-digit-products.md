Theorem
The triplet of integers $281, 282, 283$ have the property that if their digits are multiplied, and the process repeated on the result until only $1$ digit remains, that final digit is the same for all three, that is, $6$.

There does not exist an set of four consecutive integers which also all end up at the same single digit.


Proof







\(\ds 281: \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 \times 8 \times 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16\)




















\(\ds 1 \times 6\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)














\(\ds 282: \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 \times 8 \times 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 32\)




















\(\ds 3 \times 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)














\(\ds 283: \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 \times 8 \times 3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 48\)




















\(\ds 4 \times 8\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 32\)




















\(\ds 3 \times 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)

Historical Note
This result was attributed to Douglas J. Lanska and Charles Ashbacher, according to David Wells, who sourced the result from Journal of Recreational Mathematics, volume $22$ page $70$.
It has not so far proved possible to corroborate this.

Theorem
The second order ODE:

$(1): \quad y' ' + 10 y' + 25 y = 0$
has the general solution:

$y = C_1 e^{-5 x} + C_2 x e^{-5 x}$


Proof
It can be seen that $(1)$ is a constant coefficient homogeneous linear second order ODE.
Its auxiliary equation is:

$(2): \quad: m^2 + 10 m + 25 = 0$
From Solution to Quadratic Equation with Real Coefficients, the roots of $(2)$ are:

$m_1 = m_2 = -5$

These are real and equal.
So from Solution of Constant Coefficient Homogeneous LSOODE, the general solution of $(1)$ is:

$y = C_1 e^{-5 x} + C_2 x e^{-5 x}$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a group whose identity is $e$.

An element $x \in \struct {S, \circ}$ is self-inverse if and only if:

$\order x = 2$


Proof
Let $x \in G: x \ne e$.














\(\ds \order x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds x \circ x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e\)

Theorem
There exists at least one example of a topological space for which none of the Tychonoff separation axioms are satisfied.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample:
Let $T$ be the topological space consisting of the double pointed topology on the countable complement topology on an uncountable set.
From Double Pointed Countable Complement Topology fulfils no Separation Axioms, we have that $T$ satisfies none of the Tychonoff separation axioms.
$\blacksquare$

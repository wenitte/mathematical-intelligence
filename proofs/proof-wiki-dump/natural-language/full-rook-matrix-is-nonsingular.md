Theorem
A full rook matrix is nonsingular.


Proof
Let $\mathbf A$ be a full rook matrix.
By definition, $\mathbf A$ is an instance of a permutation matrix.
By Determinant of Permutation Matrix, it follows that $\det \mathbf A = \pm 1$.
By Matrix is Nonsingular iff Determinant has Multiplicative Inverse:

$\mathbf A$ is nonsingular.
$\blacksquare$

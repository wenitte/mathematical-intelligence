Theorem
Let $\RR$ be a relation on a set $S$.
Then $\RR^=$, the reflexive closure of $\RR$, is reflexive.


Proof
Recall the definition of reflexive closure:

$\RR^= := \RR \cup \Delta_S$
From Set is Subset of Union:

$\Delta_S \subseteq \RR^=$
The result follows directly from Relation Contains Diagonal Relation iff Reflexive.
$\blacksquare$

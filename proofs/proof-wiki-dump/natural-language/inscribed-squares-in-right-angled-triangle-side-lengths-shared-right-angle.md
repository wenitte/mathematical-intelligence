Theorem
Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths of a right-angled triangle, where $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.
Then the side length $l$ of the inscribed square that shares a right angle with the right-angled triangle is given by:

$l = \dfrac {a b} {a + b}$


Proof

In the figure above, let $BC = a$ and $AC = b$.
Note that $DE \parallel CF$.
Therefore $\triangle BDE \sim \triangle BCA$ by Equiangular Triangles are Similar.
Thus:














\(\ds \frac {BD} {DE}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {BC} {CA}\)





Definition of Similar Triangles














\(\ds \frac {a - l} l\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac a b\)




















\(\ds b \paren {a - l}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a l\)




















\(\ds b a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a l + b l\)




















\(\ds l\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {a b} {a + b}\)









$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $A$ and $B$ be commutative rings with unity.
Let $fÂ : A \to B$ be a ring homomorphism.
Let $\mathfrak b \subseteq B$ be an ideal.

Then $\mathfrak b$ contains the extension of its contraction by $f$:

$\mathfrak b^{ce} \subseteq \mathfrak b$


Proof













\(\ds f \sqbrk {\mathfrak b ^c}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds f \sqbrk {f^{-1} \sqbrk {\mathfrak b} }\)





Definition of Contraction of Ideal














\(\ds \)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds \mathfrak b\)





Image of Preimage under Mapping



Since $\mathfrak b^{ce}$ is generated by $f \sqbrk {\mathfrak b ^c}$ according to Definition of Extension of Ideal, it is contained in $\mathfrak b$
$\blacksquare$

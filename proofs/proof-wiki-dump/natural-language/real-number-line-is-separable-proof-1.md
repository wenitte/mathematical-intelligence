Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.

Then $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ is separable.


Proof
The rational numbers $\Q$ form a metric space.
We have that the Rationals are Everywhere Dense in Topological Space of Reals.
We also have that the Rational Numbers are Countably Infinite.
The result follows from the definition of separable space.

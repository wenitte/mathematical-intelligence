Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle with sides $a$, $b$ and $c$ opposite vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively.

Then the area $\AA$ of $\triangle ABC$ is given by:

$\AA = \sqrt {s \paren {s - a} \paren {s - b} \paren {s - c} }$
where $s = \dfrac {a + b + c} 2$ is the semiperimeter of $\triangle ABC$.


Proof
A triangle can be considered as a cyclic quadrilateral one of whose sides has degenerated to zero.
From Brahmagupta's Formula, the area of a cyclic quadrilateral is given by:

$\sqrt {\paren {s - a} \paren {s - b} \paren {s - c} \paren {s - d}}$
where $s$ is the semiperimeter:

$s = \dfrac {a + b + c + d} 2$
The result follows by letting $d$ tend to zero.

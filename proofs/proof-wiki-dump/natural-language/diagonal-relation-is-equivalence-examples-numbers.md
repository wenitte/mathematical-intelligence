Examples of Use of Diagonal Relation is Equivalence
Let $\SS$ denote the set of numbers.
Let $\RR$ denote the relation on $S$ defined as:

$\forall x, y \in S: x \mathrel \RR y \iff x = y$
Then $\RR$ is an equivalence relation such that the equivalence classes are singletons.


Proof
This is an instance of Diagonal Relation is Equivalence.
The result follows from Equivalence Classes of Diagonal Relation.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The set of complex numbers $\C$ is uncountably infinite. 


Proof
For all $r \in \R$, we have $r = r + 0 i \in C$.
Thus the set of real numbers $\R$ can be considered a subset of $\C$.
As the Real Numbers are Uncountable, it follows from Sufficient Conditions for Uncountability, proposition $(1)$, that $\C$ is uncountably infinite.

Corollary to Sequential Continuity is Equivalent to Continuity in Metric Space
Let $\struct {X, d}$ and $\struct {Y, e}$ be metric spaces.
Let $f: X \to Y$ be a mapping.

$f$ is continuous on $X$ if and only if $f$ is sequentially continuous on $X$.


Proof
This follows immediately from the definitions:
By definition, a mapping is sequentially continuous everywhere in $X$ if and only if it is sequentially continuous at each point.
Also by definition, a mapping is continuous everywhere in $X$ if and only if it is continuous at each point.
The result follows from Sequential Continuity is Equivalent to Continuity in Metric Space.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\GF$ be a Galois field. 
Then the characteristic of $\GF$ is a prime number.


Proof
By Characteristic of Field is Zero or Prime, it follows that $\Char \GF$ is $0$ or a prime number. 
By Finite Field has Non-Zero Characteristic:

$\Char \GF \ne 0$

Thus $\Char \GF$ is a prime number.
$\blacksquare$

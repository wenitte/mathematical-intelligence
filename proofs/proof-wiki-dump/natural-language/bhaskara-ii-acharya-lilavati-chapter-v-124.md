Bhaskara II Acharya: Lilavati: Chapter $\text {V}$: Progressions: $124$
In an expedition to seize his enemy's elephants, a king marched $2$ yojanas on the first day.
Say, intelligent calculator, with what increasing rate of daily march did he proceed, since he reached his foe's city, a distance of $80$ yojanas, in a week?


Solution
His march was increased by the rate of $\dfrac {22} 7$ yojanas per day.


Proof
We are given that the daily rate of march increases each day by an arithmetic sequence.
Let the initial term be denoted by $a_0$.
Let the common difference, which we are to find, be denoted by $d$.
Let the number of days march be $n$.
Let the total number of yojanas marched be $T$.
Then:














\(\ds T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n \paren {a_0 + \dfrac {n - 1} 2 d}\)





Sum of Arithmetic Sequence








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 80\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \paren {2 + \dfrac {7 - 1} 2 d}\)





plugging in the numbers














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 14 + 21 d\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {66} {21}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {22} 7\)

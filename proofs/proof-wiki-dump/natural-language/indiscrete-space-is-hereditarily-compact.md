Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau}$ be an indiscrete topological space.
Then $\struct {S, \tau}$ is hereditarily compact.


Proof
Let $\struct {H, \tau_H}$ be a subspace of $T$.
From Subset of Indiscrete Space is Compact, $\struct {H, \tau_H}$ is compact.
The result follows by definition of hereditarily compact.
$\blacksquare$

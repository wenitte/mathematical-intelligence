Theorem
Let $u$ be a differentiable real function of $x$.
Then:

$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sec u} = \sec u \tan u \dfrac {\d u} {\d x}$
where $\sec$ is the secant function and $\tan$ is the tangent function.


Proof













\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {\sec u}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d u} } {\sec u} \frac {\d u} {\d x}\)





Chain Rule for Derivatives














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sec u \tan u \frac {\d u} {\d x}\)

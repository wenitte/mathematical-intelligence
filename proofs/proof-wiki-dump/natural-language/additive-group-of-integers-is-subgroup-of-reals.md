Theorem
Let $\struct {\Z, +}$ be the additive group of integers.
Let $\struct {\R, +}$ be the additive group of real numbers.

Then $\struct {\Z, +}$ is a subgroup of $\struct {\R, +}$.


Proof
From Additive Group of Integers is Subgroup of Rationals, $\struct {\Z, +}$ is a subgroup of $\struct {\Q, +}$.
From Additive Group of Rationals is Normal Subgroup of Reals, $\struct {\Q, +}$ is a subgroup of $\struct {\R, +}$.
Thus $\struct {\Z, +}$ is a subgroup of $\struct {\R, +}$.
$\blacksquare$

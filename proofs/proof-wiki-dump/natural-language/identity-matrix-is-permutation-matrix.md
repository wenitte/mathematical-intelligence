Theorem
An identity matrix is an example of a permutation matrix.


Proof
An identity matrix, by definition, has instances of $1$ on the main diagonal and $0$ elsewhere.
Each diagonal element is by definition on one row and one column of the matrix.
Also by definition, each diagonal element is on a different row and 
column from each other diagonal element.
The result follows by definition of permutation matrix.

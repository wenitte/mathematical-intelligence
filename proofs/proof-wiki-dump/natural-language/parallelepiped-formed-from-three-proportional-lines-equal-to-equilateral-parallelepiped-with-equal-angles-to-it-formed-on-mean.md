Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If three straight lines be proportional, the parallelepipedal solid formed out of the three is equal to the parallelepipedal solid on the mean which is equilateral, but equiangular with the aforesaid solid.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XI}$: Proposition $36$)


Proof

Let $A, B, C$ be three straight lines in proportion:

$A : B  = B : C$
Let a solid angle be constructed at $E$ contained by the plane angles $\angle DEG, \angle GEF, \angle FED$.
Let each of the straight lines $DE, GE, EF$ be made equal to $B$.
Let the parallelepiped $EK$ be completed.
Let the straight line $LM$ be made equal to $A$.
Let a solid angle be constructed at $L$ contained by the plane angles $\angle NLO, \angle OLM, \angle MLN$.
Let the straight line $LO$ be made equal to $B$.
Let the straight line $LN$ be made equal to $C$.
We have that:

$A : B = B : C$
while:

$A = LM$
$B = LO = ED = EF$
$C = LN$
Therefore:

$LM = EF = DE : LN$
Thus the sides about the equal angles $\angle NLM, \angle DEF$ are reciprocally proportional.
Therefore from Proposition $14$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Sides of Equal and Equiangular Parallelograms are Reciprocally Proportional:

the parallelogram $MN$ equals the parallelogram $DF$.
It follows from Porism to Proposition $35$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Condition for Equal Angles contained by Elevated Straight Lines from Plane Angles:

the perpendiculars from $G$ and $O$ to the planes containing $\angle NLM$ and $\angle DEF$ are equal.
Therefore the parallelepipeds $LH$ and $EK$ are of equal height.
So from Proposition $31$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Parallelepipeds on Equal Bases and Same Height are Equal in Volume:

$LH = EK$.
We have that:

$LH$ is the parallelepiped formed out of $A, B, C$
$EK$ is the parallelepiped formed out of $B$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $36$ of Book $\text{XI}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

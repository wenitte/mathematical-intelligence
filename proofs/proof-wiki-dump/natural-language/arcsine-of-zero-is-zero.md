Theorem
$\arcsin 0 = 0$
where $\arcsin$ is the arcsine function. 


Proof
By definition, $\arcsin$ is the inverse of the restriction of the sine function to $\closedint {-\dfrac \pi 2} {\dfrac \pi 2}$.
Therefore, if: 

$\sin x = 0$
and $-\dfrac \pi 2 \le x \le \dfrac \pi 2$, then $\arcsin 0 = x$. 
From Sine of Zero is Zero, we have that: 

$\sin 0 = 0$
We have $-\dfrac \pi 2 < 0 < \dfrac \pi 2$, so: 

$\arcsin 0 = 0$
$\blacksquare$

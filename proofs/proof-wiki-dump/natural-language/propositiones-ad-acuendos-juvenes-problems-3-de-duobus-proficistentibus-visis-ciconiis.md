Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $3$
De Duobus Proficistentibus Visis Ciconiis
Two Travellers and a Flock of Storks
Two walkers saw some storks and wondered how many there were.
Conferring, they decided:
If there were the same number again,
and again,
and then a half and a third of the sum that would make,
plus two more,
that would make $100$.
How many storks were seen?


Solution
$28$.


Proof
Let $x$ be the of storks seen.
Then we have:

$x + x + x + \dfrac 1 2 \times \dfrac 1 3 \times \paren {x + x + x} + 2 = 100$
That is, after algebra:

$\dfrac {21 x} 6 = 98$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

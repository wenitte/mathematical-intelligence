Theorem
Let $S$ be a subset of the real numbers $\R$.
Let $T = \set {x \in \R: -x \in S}$ be the set of negatives of the elements of $S$.

Then:

$U$ is an upper bound of $S$
if and only if:

$-U$ is a lower bound of $T$.


Proof
Let $V$ be the set defined as:

$V = \set {x \in \R: -x \in T}$

From Negative of Lower Bound of Set of Real Numbers is Upper Bound of Negatives:

$B$ is a lower bound of $T$
if and only if:

$-B$ is an upper bound of $V$

Then we have:














\(\ds V\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \set {x \in \R: -x \in T}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \set {x \in \R: -\paren {-x} \in S}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \set {x \in \R: x \in S}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds S\)










That is:

$B$ is a lower bound of $T$
if and only if:

$-B$ is an upper bound of $S$

The result follows by setting $U = -B$.
$\blacksquare$

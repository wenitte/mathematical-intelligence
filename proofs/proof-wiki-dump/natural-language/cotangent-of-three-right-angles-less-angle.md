Theorem
$\cot \left({\dfrac {3 \pi} 2 - \theta}\right) = \tan \theta$
where $\cot$ and $\tan$ are cotangent and tangent respectively.


Proof













\(\ds \cot \left({\frac {3 \pi} 2 - \theta}\right)\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\cos \left({\frac {3 \pi} 2 - \theta}\right)} {\sin \left({\frac {3 \pi} 2 - \theta}\right)}\)





Cotangent is Cosine divided by Sine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {-\sin \theta} {-\cos \theta}\)





Cosine of Three Right Angles and Sine of Three Right Angles














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tan \theta\)





Tangent is Sine divided by Cosine



$\blacksquare$

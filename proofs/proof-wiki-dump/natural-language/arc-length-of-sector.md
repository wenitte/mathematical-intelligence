Theorem
Let $\CC = ABC$ be a circle whose center is $A$ and with radii $AB$ and $AC$.
Let $BAC$ be the sector of $\CC$ whose angle between $AB$ and $AC$ is $\theta$.



Then the length $s$ of arc $BC$ is given by:

$s = r \theta$
where:

$r = AB$ is the length of the radius of the circle
$\theta$ is measured in radians.


Proof
From Perimeter of Circle, the perimeter of $\CC$ is $2 \pi r$.
From Measurement of Full Angle, the angle within $\CC$ is $2 \pi$.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Why is the density of the arc length uniform? i.e. why does equal rotation sweeps out equal arc length?You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
The fraction of the perimeter of $\CC$ within the sector $BAC$ is therefore $2 \pi r \times \dfrac \theta {2 \pi}$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

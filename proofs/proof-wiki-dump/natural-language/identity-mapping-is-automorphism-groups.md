Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group whose identity is $e$.
Then $I_G: \struct {G, \circ} \to \struct {G, \circ}$ is a group automorphism.
Its kernel is $\set e$.


Proof
The main result Identity Mapping is Automorphism holds directly.
As $I_G$ is a bijection, the only element that maps to $e$ is $e$ itself.
Thus the kernel is $\set e$.
$\blacksquare$

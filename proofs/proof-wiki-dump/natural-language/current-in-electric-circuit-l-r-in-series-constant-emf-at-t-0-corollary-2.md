Theorem
Consider the electric circuit $K$ consisting of:

a resistance $R$
an inductance $L$
in series with a source of electromotive force $E$ which is a function of time $t$.



Let the electric current flowing in $K$ at time $t = 0$ be $0$.
Let a constant EMF $E_0$ be imposed upon $K$ at time $t = 0$.
The electric current $I$ in $K$ is given by the equation:

$I = \dfrac {E_0} R \paren {1 - e^{-R t / L} }$


Proof
From Electric Current in Electric Circuit: L, R in Series: Constant EMF at $t = 0$:

$I = \dfrac {E_0} R + \paren {I_0 - \dfrac {E_0} R} e^{-R t / L}$
Setting $I_0 = 0$:














\(\ds I\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {E_0} R + \paren {0 - \dfrac {E_0} R} e^{-R t / L}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {E_0} R \paren {1 - e^{-R t / L} }\)









Hence the result.

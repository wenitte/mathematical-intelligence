Theorem
Let $\R_{\ne 0}$ be the set of real numbers without zero:

$\R_{\ne 0} = \R \setminus \set 0$
The structure $\struct {\R_{\ne 0}, \times}$ forms a group.


Proof
Taking the group axioms in turn:


Group Axiom $\text G 0$: Closure
From Non-Zero Real Numbers Closed under Multiplication: Proof 2, $\R_{\ne 0}$ is closed under multiplication.
Note that proof 2 needs to be used specifically here, as proof 1 rests on this result.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 1$: Associativity
Real Multiplication is Associative.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 2$: Existence of Identity Element: Real Multiplication Identity is One
The identity element of real number multiplication is the real number $1$:

$\exists 1 \in \R: \forall a \in \R_{\ne 0}: a \times 1 = a = 1 \times a$
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 3$: Existence of Inverse Element: Inverse for Real Multiplication
Each element $x$ of the set of non-zero real numbers $\R_{\ne 0}$ has an inverse element $\dfrac 1 x$ under the operation of real number multiplication:

$\forall x \in \R_{\ne 0}: \exists \dfrac 1 x \in \R_{\ne 0}: x \times \dfrac 1 x = 1 = \dfrac 1 x \times x$
$\blacksquare$

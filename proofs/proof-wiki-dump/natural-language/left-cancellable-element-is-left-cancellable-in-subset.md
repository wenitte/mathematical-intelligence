Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be an algebraic structure.
Let $\struct {T, \circ} \subseteq \struct {S, \circ}$.
Let $x \in T$ be left cancellable in $S$.

Then $x$ is also left cancellable in $T$.


Proof
Let $x \in T$ be left cancellable in $S$.
That is:

$\forall a, b \in S: x \circ a = x \circ b \implies a = b$
Therefore:

$\forall c, d \in T: x \circ c = x \circ d \implies c = d$
Thus $x$ is left cancellable in $T$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $G$ be a commutative topological semigroup with identity $0_G$.

Let $\set{i_0, i_1, \ldots, i_n}$ be a finite enumeration of a finite set $I$. 

Let $\family{g_i}_{i \in I}$ be an indexed family of elements of $G$.

Then:

the generalized sum $\ds \sum_{i \mathop \in I} g_i$
converges to:

the summation over finite index $\ds \sum_{i \mathop \in I} g_i$
Proof
Let $\FF$ be the set of finite subsets of $I$.

Let $h = \ds \sum_{i \mathop \in I} g_i$ be the summation over finite index $I$.
Let $U$ be an open subset of $G$ such that $h \in U$.

From Set is Subset of Itself:

$I \in \FF$
Let: 

$J \in \FFÂ : I \subseteq J$

Let $h'= \ds \sum_{j \mathop \in J} g_j$ be the summation over finite index $J$.

By definition of $\FF$:

$J \subseteq I$
By definition of set equality:

$I = J$
Hence:

$h'= h \in U$

Since $U$ was arbitrary, by definition of convergance:

the generalized sum $\ds \sum_{i \mathop \in I} g_i$
converges to:

the summation over finite index $\ds \sum_{i \mathop \in I} g_i$
$\blacksquare$

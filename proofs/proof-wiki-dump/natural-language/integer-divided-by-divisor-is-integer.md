Theorem
Let $a, b \in \N$.
Then:

$b \divides a \implies \dfrac 1 b \times a \in \N$
where $\divides$ denotes divisibilty.

In the words of Euclid:

If a number be measured by any number, the number which is measured will have a part called by the same name as the measuring number.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VII}$: Proposition $37$)


Proof
Let $b \divides a$.
By definition of divisibilty:

$\exists c \in \N: c \times b = a$
Then also:

$c \times 1 = c$
So by Proposition $15$ of Book $\text{VII} $: Alternate Ratios of Multiples:

$1 : b = c : a$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $37$ of Book $\text{VII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

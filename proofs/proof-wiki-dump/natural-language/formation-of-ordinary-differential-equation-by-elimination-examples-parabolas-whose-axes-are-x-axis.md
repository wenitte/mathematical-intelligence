Examples of Formation of Ordinary Differential Equation by Elimination
Consider the set of all parabolas embedded in the Cartesian plane whose axis is the $x$ axis.

This set can be expressed as the ordinary differential equation of order $2$:

$y \dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2} + \paren {\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} }^2 = 0$


Proof
Such a parabola has the equation:

$y^2 = 4 a \paren {x - h}$
Differentiating twice with respect to $x$:














\(\ds 2 y \dfrac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 a\)

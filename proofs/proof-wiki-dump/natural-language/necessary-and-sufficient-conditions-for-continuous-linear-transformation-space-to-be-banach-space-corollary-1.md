Theorem
Let $\mathbb K = \set {\R, \C}$.
Let $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,}_X}$ be a normed vector space over $\mathbb K$.
Let $CL$ be the continuous linear transformation space.
Let $\norm {\, \cdot \,}$ be the supremum operator norm.

Then $\struct {\map {CL} {X, \mathbb K}, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ is a Banach space.


Proof
$X' := \map {CL} {X, \mathbb K}$ is the dual space of $X$
So this theorem is the same as Normed Dual Space is Banach Space.

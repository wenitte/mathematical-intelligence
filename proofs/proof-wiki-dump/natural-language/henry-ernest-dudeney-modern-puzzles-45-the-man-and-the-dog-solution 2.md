Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $45$
The Man and the Dog
"Yes, when I take my dog for a walk," said a mathematical friend, "he frequently supplies me with some interesting problem to solve.
One day, for example, he waited, as I left the door, to see which way I should go,
and when I started he raced to the end of the road, immediately returning to me;
again racing to the end of the road and again returning.
He did this four times in all, at a uniform speed,
then ran at my side the remaining distance, which according to my paces measured $27$ yards.
I afterwards measured the distance from my door to the end of the road and found it to be $625$ feet.
Now, if I walk $4$ miles per hour, what is the speed of my dog when racing to and fro?"


Solution
The speed of the dog is $16$ miles per hour.


Proof
Recall that $1$ mile is $1760$ yards, while $1$ yard is $3$ feet.
Therefore the dog owner is walking at a pace of $21 \, 120$ feet per hour, with $81$ feet remaining after the four trips.

Suppose the dog is running at a pace of $x$ feet per hour.
Suppose after some trips, the owner still $d$ feet of the road to go.
For the next trip, the owner and the dog would have travelled a total of $2 d$ feet.
With their combined speed of $\paren {x + 21 \, 120}$ feet per hour, this trip would have taken $\dfrac {2 d} {x + 21 \, 120}$ hours.
The owner would have walked an additional $\dfrac {21 \, 120 \times 2 d} {x + 21 \, 120}$ feet, so there would be

$d - \dfrac {21 \, 120 \times 2d } {x + 21 \, 120} = \dfrac {d \paren {x - 21 \, 120} } {x + 21120}$
feet of road to cover, $\dfrac {x - 21 \, 120} {x + 21 \, 120}$ of the previous distance.

Thus after four trips, the remaining distance is $\paren {\dfrac {x - 21120} {x + 21120} }^4$ of the original.
We have:














\(\ds 625 \paren {\frac {x - 21 \, 120} {x + 21 \, 120} }^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 81\)




















\(\ds \paren {\frac {x - 21\, 120} {x + 21 \, 120} }^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {3^4} {5^4}\)




















\(\ds 5 \paren {x - 21 \, 120}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \paren {x + 21 \, 120}\)




















\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 84 \, 480\)









Hence the speed of the dog is $84 \, 480$ feet per hour, or $16$ miles per hour.
$\blacksquare$

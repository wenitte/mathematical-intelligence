Theorem
Let $L = \struct {S, \preceq}$ be a lattice.
Let $X$ be a subset of $S$.

Then

$X$ is a prime filter in $L$
if and only if:

$X$ is a prime ideal in $L^{-1}$
where $L^{-1} = \struct {S, \succeq}$ denotes the dual of $L$.


Proof
By Dual of Dual Ordering:

dual of $L^{-1}$ is $L$.
Hence by Prime Ideal is Prime Filter in Dual Lattice:

the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The set of integers under multiplication $\struct {\Z, \times}$ does not form a group.


Proof
In order to be classified as a group, the algebraic structure $\struct {\Z, \times}$ needs to fulfil the group axioms.
From Integers under Multiplication form Monoid, $\struct {\Z, \times}$ forms a monoid.
Therefore Group Axiom $\text G 0$: Closure, Group Axiom $\text G 1$: Associativity and Group Axiom $\text G 2$: Existence of Identity Element are satisfied.
However, from Invertible Integers under Multiplication, the only integers with inverses under multiplication are $1$ and $-1$.
As not all integers have inverses, it follows that $\struct {\Z, \times}$ is not a group.
$\blacksquare$

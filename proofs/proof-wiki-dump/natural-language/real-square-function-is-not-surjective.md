Example of Mapping which is Not a Surjection
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be the real square function:

$\forall x \in \R: \map f x = x^2$
Then $f$ is not a surjection.


Proof
For $f$ to be a surjection, it would be necessary that:

$\forall y \in \R: \exists x \in \R: \map f x = y$
However from Square of Real Number is Non-Negative:

$\forall y \in \R_{< 0}: \nexists x \in \R: \map f x = y$
Hence $f$ is not a surjection.

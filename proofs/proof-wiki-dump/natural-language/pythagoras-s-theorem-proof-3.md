Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a right triangle with $c$ as the hypotenuse.
Then:

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$


Proof

The area of the big square is $c^2$.
It is also equal to $4 \dfrac {a b} 2 + \paren {a - b}^2$.
So:














\(\ds c^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \frac {a b} 2 + \paren {a - b}^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 a b + a^2 - 2 a b + b^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2 + b^2\)









$\blacksquare$

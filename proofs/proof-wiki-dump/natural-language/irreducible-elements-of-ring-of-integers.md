Theorem
Let $\struct {\Z, +, \times}$ be the ring of integers.

The irreducible elements of $\struct {\Z, +, \times}$ are the prime numbers and their negatives.


Proof
We have that Integers form Integral Domain.
Therefore the concept of irreducible is defined.
Let $p$ be a prime number.
By definition, the only divisors of $p$ are $1, -1, p, -p$.
From Units of Ring of Integers, $1$ and $-1$ are (the only) units of $\Z$.
From Associates are Unit Multiples, $p$ and $-p$ are (the only) associates of each other.
Hence the result, from the definition of irreducible.

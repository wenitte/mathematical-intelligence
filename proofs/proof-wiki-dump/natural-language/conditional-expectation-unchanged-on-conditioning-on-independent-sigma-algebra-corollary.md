Theorem
Let $\struct {\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr}$ be a probability space.
Let $\HH \subseteq \Sigma$ be a sub-$\sigma$-algebra.
Let $X$ be a integrable random variable such that: 

$\map \sigma X$ is independent of $\HH$
where $\map \sigma X$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $X$. 
Let $\expect {X \mid \HH}$ be a version of the conditional expectation of $X$ given $\GG$.

Then: 

$\expect {X \mid \HH} = \expect X$ almost surely.


Proof
Note that: 

$\map \sigma X = \map \sigma {\set {\O, \Omega}, \map \sigma X}$
So by Conditional Expectation Unchanged on Conditioning on Independent Sigma-Algebra, we have:

$\expect {X \mid \map \sigma {\set {\O, \Omega}, \HH} } = \expect {X \mid \set {\O, \Omega} }$
From Conditional Expectation Conditioned on Trivial Sigma-Algebra, we have:

$\expect {X \mid \set {\O, \Omega} } = \expect X$ almost surely.
Also, since: 

$\set {\O, \Omega} \subseteq \HH$
we have that:

$\map \sigma {\set {\O, \Omega}, \HH} = \HH$
giving:

$\expect {X \mid \HH} = \expect X$ almost surely.
$\blacksquare$

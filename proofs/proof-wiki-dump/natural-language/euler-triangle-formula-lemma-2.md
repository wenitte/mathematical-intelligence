Lemma to Euler Triangle Formula


Let the bisector of angle $C$ of triangle $\triangle ABC$ be produced to the circumcircle at $P$.
Let $I$ be the incenter of $\triangle ABC$.
Then:

$AP = BP = IP$


Proof 1
Without loss of generality, it will be demonstrated that $BP = IP$.
Let $CP$ be the bisector of $\angle ACB$.

$\angle ACP$ and $\angle ICB$ both subtend $AP$.
Hence indirectly by the Inscribed Angle Theorem:

$\angle ACP = \angle ICB$
From Angles on Equal Arcs are Equal:

$\angle ACP = \angle ABP$
and so:

$\angle ABP = \angle ICB$
By the construction of the incircle, $IB$ is the bisector of $B$.
Then:

$\angle IBA = \angle IBC$
and so:














\(\ds \angle IBP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle IBA + \angle ABP\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle IBC + \angle ICB\)










By Sum of Angles of Triangle equals Two Right Angles:

$\angle CIB + \angle IBC + \angle ICB = \angle CIB + \angle PIB$
as $\angle CIB$ and $\angle PIB$ are supplementary.
Thus:














\(\ds \angle PIB\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle IBC + \angle ICB\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle IBP\)









and from Triangle with Two Equal Angles is Isosceles:

$IP = BP$

The proof that $IP = AP$ follows the same lines.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
We have by hypothesis:

$AI$, $BI$ and $CI$ bisect their respective angles.
Let the half-angles be:

$\alpha = \dfrac 1 2 \angle CAB$
$\beta = \dfrac 1 2 \angle ABC$
$\gamma = \dfrac 1 2 \angle BCA$














\(\ds AP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds BP\)





Equal Angles in Equal Circles














\(\ds \angle BAP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \gamma\)





Angles on Equal Arcs are Equal














\(\ds \angle API\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle ABC = 2 \beta\)





Angles on Equal Arcs are Equal








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \angle IAP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \alpha + \gamma\)




















\(\ds \angle AIP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \alpha + \gamma\)





Sum of Angles of Triangle equals Two Right Angles



By Triangle with Two Equal Angles is Isosceles

$\triangle AIP$ is isosceles
$\leadsto$:

$AP = BP = IP$
$\blacksquare$

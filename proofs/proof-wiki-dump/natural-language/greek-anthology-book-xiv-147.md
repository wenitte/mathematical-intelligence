Epigram
Answer of Homer to Hesiod when he asked the Number of the Greeks who took part in the War against Troy
There were seven hearths of fierce fire, and in each were fifty spits and fifty joints on them.
About each joint were nine hundred Achaeans.


Solution
Let $n$ be the number of Achaeans (that is, Greeks).














\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \times 50 \times 900\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 315 \, 000\)









So there were $315 \, 000$ Achaeans in total.
$\blacksquare$

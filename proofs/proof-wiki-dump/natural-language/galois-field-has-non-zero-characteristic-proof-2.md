Theorem
Let $\GF$ be a Galois field.
Then the characteristic of $\GF$ is non-zero.


Proof
Let $\GF$ be a Galois field.
Let $P$ be its prime subfield.
Suppose $\Char \GF = 0$.
Then from Field of Characteristic Zero has Unique Prime Subfield, $P$ is isomorphic to $\Q$ which is infinite.
But a Galois field can not have an infinite subfield.

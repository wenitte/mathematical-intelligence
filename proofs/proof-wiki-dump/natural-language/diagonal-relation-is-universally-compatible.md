Theorem
The diagonal relation $\Delta_S$ on a set $S$ is universally compatible on $S$.


Proof

The validity of the material on this page is questionable.In particular: It needs to be pointed out that the definition of universally compatible relation may not be correct as such. I will address it when I work up to that chapter in my book.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by resolving the issues.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Questionable}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be any algebraic structure.

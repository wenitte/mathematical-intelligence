Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a meet semilattice.
Let $s \in S$.

Then:

$s$ is the greatest element of $S$
if and only if

$s$ is the identity in $\struct{S, \wedge}$.


Proof
This is the dual statement of Join Semilattice has Smallest Element iff has Identity by Dual Pairs (Order Theory).
The result follows from the Duality Principle.
$\blacksquare$

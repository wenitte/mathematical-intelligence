Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a Pythagorean triangle.
Let $r$ be the inradius of $\triangle ABC$.

Then $r$ is an integer.


Proof
Let $\triangle ABC$ be such that $\angle C$ is a right angle.
Let:

$A$ be opposite the side $a$
$B$ be opposite the side $b$
$C$ be opposite the side $c$


From Solutions of Pythagorean Equation, we have that:

$c = m^2 + n^2$
for some $m, n \in \Z_{>0}$, and that the other sides are $m^2 - n^2$ and $2 m n$
Without loss of generality, let the sides $a$ and $b$ be such that:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m^2 - n^2\)




















\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 m n\)










Hence:














\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a - r} + \paren {b - r}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a + b - 2 r\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {a + b - c} 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {m^2 - n^2 + 2 m n - \paren {m^2 + n^2} } 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 m n - 2 n^2} 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n \paren {m - n}\)










As $m$ and $n$ are both integers, it follows that $r$ is also an integer.

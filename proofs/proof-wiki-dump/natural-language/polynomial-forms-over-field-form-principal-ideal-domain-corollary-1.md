Corollary to Polynomial Forms over Field form Principal Ideal Domain
Let $\struct {F, +, \circ}$ be a field whose zero is $0_F$ and whose unity is $1_F$.
Let $X$ be transcendental over $F$.
Let $F \sqbrk X$ be the ring of polynomials in $X$ over $F$.

Let $f$ be an irreducible element of $F \sqbrk X$.
Then $F \sqbrk X / \ideal f$ is a field, where $\ideal f$ denotes the ideal generated by $f$.


Proof
It follows from Principal Ideal of Principal Ideal Domain is of Irreducible Element iff Maximal that $\ideal f$ is maximal for irreducible $f$.
Therefore by Maximal Ideal iff Quotient Ring is Field, $F \sqbrk X / \ideal f$ is a field.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $E$ be an ellipse embedded in in a Euclidean plane.
Then $E$ is bounded.


Proof
Let a Cartesian coordinate system be applied to the Euclidean plane in which $E$ is embedded.
Let $E$ be expressed in reduced form:














\(\ds \dfrac {x^2} {a^2} + \dfrac {y^2} {b^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac x a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {1 - \dfrac {y^2} {b^2} }\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac y b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {1 - \dfrac {x^2} {a^2} }\)









Hence:

there are no real values of $x$ for $\size y > b$
there are no real values of $y$ for $\size x > b$.
Hence $E$ exists entirely within the rectangle whose sides are $x = \pm a$ and $y = \pm b$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

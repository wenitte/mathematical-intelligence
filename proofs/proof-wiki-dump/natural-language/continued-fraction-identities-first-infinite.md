It has been suggested that this page be renamed.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.

This page has been identified as a candidate for refactoring of basic complexity.In particular: transclude this at Properties of Limit of Infinite Continued FractionsUntil this has been finished, please leave {{Refactor}} in the code.
New contributors: Refactoring is a task which is expected to be undertaken by experienced editors only.

Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.
Theorem
Let $\left[{a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots}\right]$ be a simple infinite continued fraction.
Then:

$\left[{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots}\right] = a_1 + \dfrac 1 {\left[{a_2, a_3, \ldots}\right]}$


Proof

This theorem requires a proof.In particular: use continuityYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by crafting such a proof.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{ProofWanted}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

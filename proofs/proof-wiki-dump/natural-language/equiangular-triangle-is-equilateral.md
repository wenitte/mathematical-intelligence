Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be equiangular.
Then $\triangle ABC$ is an equilateral triangle.


Proof
Let $\triangle ABC$ be equiangular.
By definition of equiangular polygon, any two of the internal angles of $\triangle ABC$ are equal.
Without loss of generality, let $\angle ABC = \angle ACB$.
Then by Triangle with Two Equal Angles is Isosceles, $AB = AC$.
As the choice of equal angles was arbitrary, it follows that any two sides of $\triangle ABC$ are equal.
Hence all $3$ sides of $\triangle ABC$ are equal.
Hence the result by definition of equilateral triangle.
$\blacksquare$

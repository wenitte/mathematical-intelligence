Theorem
Every ordinal is a transitive set.


Proof
Let $\alpha$ be an ordinal by Definition 4.
$\alpha$ is an ordinal if and only if:

$\alpha$ is an element of every superinductive class.

The proof proceeds by the Principle of Superinduction.

From Empty Class is Transitive we start with the fact that $0$ is transitive.
$\Box$

Let $x$ be transitive.
From Successor Set of Transitive Set is Transitive:

$x^+$ is transitive.
$\Box$

We have that Class is Transitive iff Union is Subclass.
Hence the union of a chain of transitive sets is transitive.
$\Box$

Hence the result by the Principle of Superinduction.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $G$ be a graph.
Then $G$ is $0$-regular graph if and only if $G$ is edgeless.


Proof
Sufficient Condition
Let $G$ be an edgeless graph.
By definition of edgeless graph, $G$ has no edges.
That means every vertex of $G$ is incident with no edges.
That is, every vertex of $G$ is of degree $0$.
Hence the result, by definition of $0$-regular graph.
$\Box$


Necessary Condition
Let $G$ be a $0$-regular graph.
Then every vertex is incident with no edges.
So as there are no vertices with incident edges, there can be no edges.
Hence $G$ is an edgeless graph.

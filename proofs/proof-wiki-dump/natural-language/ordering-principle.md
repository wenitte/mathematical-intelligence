Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.

Then there exists a total ordering on $S$.


Proof 1
From Zermelo's Well-Ordering Theorem, $S$ has a well-ordering.
The result follows from Well-Ordering is Total Ordering.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
This theorem follows trivially from the Order-Extension Principle.
$\blacksquare$


Remarks

This page or section has statements made on it that ought to be extracted and proved in a Theorem page.In particular: Extract and put into relevant pagesYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by creating any appropriate Theorem pages that may be needed.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.
As shown in Proof 2 the Ordering Principle is weaker than the Order-Extension Principle (OE).
It is known that it is in fact strictly weaker than OE.
However, the Ordering Principle cannot be proved in Zermel-Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice.
In fact it is known to be strictly stronger than the Axiom of Choice for Finite Sets.

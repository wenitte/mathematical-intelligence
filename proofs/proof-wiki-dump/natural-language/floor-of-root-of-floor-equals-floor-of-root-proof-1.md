Theorem
$\ds \floor {\sqrt {\floor x} } = \floor {\sqrt x}$


Proof 1













\(\ds n\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds \floor {\sqrt x} \, \)

\(\ds n\)

\(\le\)

\(\, \ds \sqrt x \, \)

\(\, \ds < \, \)



\(\ds n + 1\)





Integer equals Floor iff Number between Integer and One More

\(\ds n^2\)

\(\le\)

\(\, \ds x \, \)

\(\, \ds < \, \)



\(\ds \paren {n + 1}^2\)





Order is Preserved on Positive Reals by Squaring

Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.
Let $\openint a b$ be an open interval of $\R$.

Then the closure of $\openint a b$ is the closed interval $\closedint a b$.


Proof
From Limit Points of Open Real Interval, the limit points of $\openint a b$ consist of:

the points $\openint a b$ itself
and

the points $a$ and $b$.
By definition, the closure of $\openint a b$ is the union of $\openint a b$ and its limit points.
Hence the result, by definition of the closed interval $\closedint a b$.
$\blacksquare$

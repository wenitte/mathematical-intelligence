Theorem
Let $A$ be the set of all real sequences $\sequence {x_i}$ such that the series $\ds \sum_{i \mathop \ge 0} x_i^2$ is convergent.
Let $\ell^2 = \struct {A, d_2}$ be the Hilbert sequence space on $\R$.

Then $\ell^2$ is not a locally compact Hausdorff space.


Proof
From Metric Space fulfils all Separation Axioms, $\ell^2$ is a Hausdorff space.

Let $x = \sequence {x_i} \in A$ be a point of $\ell^2$.
From Point in Hilbert Sequence Space has no Compact Neighborhood, $x$ has no compact neighborhood.
Hence the result by definition of locally compact Hausdorff space.
$\blacksquare$

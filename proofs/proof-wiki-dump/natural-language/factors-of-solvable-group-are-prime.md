Theorem
Let $G$ be a solvable group.
Let $\HH$ be a composition series of $G$.

Then all factor groups of $\HH$ must be prime.


Proof
By definition, a composition series is a normal series whose factor groups are all simple.
A solvable group, by definition, is one which has a composition series whose factor groups are all cyclic.
From Cyclic Group is Simple iff Prime, it follows that all the factor groups of a composition series of a solvable group must all be prime.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a sequence in $\R$.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be convergent.

Then $\sequence {x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.


Proof
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be convergent.
Let $\struct {\R, d}$ be the metric space formed from $\R$ and the usual (Euclidean) metric:

$\map d {x_1, x_2} = \size {x_1 - x_2}$
where $\size x$ is the absolute value of $x$.
This is proven to be a metric space in Real Number Line is Metric Space.
From Convergent Sequence in Metric Space is Cauchy Sequence, we have that every convergent sequence in a metric space is a Cauchy sequence.
Hence $\sequence {x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

Also known as
Cauchy's Convergence Criterion is also known as the Cauchy Convergence Condition.

Theorem
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sin x} = \cos x$


Proof













\(\ds \dfrac \d {\d x} \sin x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac \d {\d x} \map \cos {\frac \pi 2 - x}\)





Cosine of Complement equals Sine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \sin {\frac \pi 2 - x}\)





Derivative of Cosine Function and Chain Rule for Derivatives














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cos x\)





Sine of Complement equals Cosine

Theorem
Let $n \in \Z$ be an integer such that $n > 3$.

Then at least one of $n$, $n + 2$, $n + 4$ is divisible by $3$.


Proof
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$.
Then $n$ can be represented as either:














\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 k\)




















\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 k + 1\)




















\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 k + 2\)









Let $n = 3 k$.
Then $n$ is divisible by $3$.
Let $n = 3 k + 1$.
Then:

$n + 2 = 3 k + 3 = 3 \paren {k + 1}$
which is divisible by $3$.

Let $n = 3 k + 2$.
Then:

$n + 4 = 3 k + 6 = 3 \paren {k + 2}$
which is divisible by $3$.

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \vee, \wedge, \neg}$ be a Boolean algebra.

Then:

$\neg \bot = \top$


Proof
Since $\bot$ is the identity for $\vee$, the first condition for $\neg \bot$:

$\bot \vee \neg \bot = \top$
implies that $\neg \bot = \top$ is the only possibility.
Since $\top$ is the identity for $\wedge$, it follows that:

$\bot \wedge \top = \bot$
and we conclude that:

$\neg \bot = \top$
as desired.
$\blacksquare$

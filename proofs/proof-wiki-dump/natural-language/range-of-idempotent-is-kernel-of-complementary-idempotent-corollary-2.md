Corollary to Range of Idempotent is Kernel of Complementary Idempotent
Let $\struct {\HH, \innerprod \cdot \cdot}$ be a Hilbert space.
Let $A$ be an idempotent operator.

Then:

$\Rng A$ is a closed linear subspace of $\HH$.


Proof
From Range of Idempotent is Kernel of Complementary Idempotent, we have:

$\Rng A = \map \ker {I - A}$
From Space of Bounded Linear Transformations forms Vector Space:

$I - A$ is a Definition:Bounded Linear Transformation.
From Kernel of Bounded Linear Transformation is Closed Linear Subspace, we have:

$\map \ker {I - A}$ is a closed linear subspace of $\HH$.
Hence $\Rng A$ is a closed linear subspace of $\HH$.
$\blacksquare$

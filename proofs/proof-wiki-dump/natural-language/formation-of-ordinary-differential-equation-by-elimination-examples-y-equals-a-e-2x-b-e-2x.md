Examples of Formation of Ordinary Differential Equation by Elimination
Consider the equation:

$(1): \quad y = A e^{2 x} + B e^{-2 x}$

This can be expressed as the ordinary differential equation of order $2$:

$\dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2} = 4 y$


Proof
Differentiating twice with respect to $x$:














\(\ds \dfrac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 A e^{2 x} - 2 B e^{-2 x}\)





Derivative of Exponential Function








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 A e^{2 x} + 4 B e^{-2 x}\)





Derivative of Exponential Function














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 y\)





substituting from $(1)$

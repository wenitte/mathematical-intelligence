Porism to Proportional Magnitudes have Proportional Remainders
In the words of Euclid:

From this it is manifest that, if magnitudes be proportional componendo, they will also be proportional convertendo.
(The Elements: Book $\text{V}$: Proposition $19$ : Porism)


Proof

From Proposition $19$ of Book $\text{V} $: Proportional Magnitudes have Proportional Remainders:

$EB : FD = AB : CD$
From Proposition $16$ of Book $\text{V} $: Proportional Magnitudes are Proportional Alternately:

$AB : BE = CD : FD$
Therefore magnitudes compounded are proportional.
But it was also proved that:

$BA : AE = DC : CF$
and this is convertendo.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $19$ of Book $\text{V}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It was suggested by Heiberg that this porism, along with its explanation, was not original to Euclid, but was a later interpolation, dating from a time before that of Theon.

Theorem
Let $S$ be a set of $n$ objects.

The total number $N$ of ways that at least $1$ object can be selected from $S$ is:

$N = 2^n - 1$


Proof
This is equivalent to counting the number of non-empty subsets of $S$.
From Cardinality of Power Set of Finite Set, the total number of subsets of $S$ is $2^n$.
This includes the empty set.
Excluding the empty set from the count gives the result.
$\blacksquare$


Examples
$6$ Items
Let there be $6$ different flowers in a vase.
Then there are $63$ different ways of selecting at least one of these flowers.

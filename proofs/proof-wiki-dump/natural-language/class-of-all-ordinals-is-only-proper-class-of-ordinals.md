Theorem
Let $A$ be a transitive proper class of ordinals.
Then $A$ is the class of all ordinals $\On$.


Proof
Let $A$ be a transitive class of ordinals.
Let there exist $\alpha \in \On$ such that $\alpha \notin A$.
Then by Transitive Class of Ordinals is Subset of Ordinal not in it:

$A \subseteq \alpha$
But that makes $A$ a set.
So if $A$ is a proper class, it must contain all ordinals.
That is:

$A = \On$
$\blacksquare$

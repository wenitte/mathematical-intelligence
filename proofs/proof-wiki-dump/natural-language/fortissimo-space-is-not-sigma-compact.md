Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a Fortissimo space.

Then $T$ is not a $\sigma$-compact space.


Proof
From Compact Sets in Fortissimo Space we have that the only compact sets in $T$ are finite.
A union of countably many finite sets can not be an uncountable set.
Hence the result by definition of $\sigma$-compact space.
$\blacksquare$

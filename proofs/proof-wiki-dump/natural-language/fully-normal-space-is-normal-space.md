Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a fully normal space.
Then $T$ is a normal space.


Proof
From the definition, $T$ is fully normal if and only if:

$T$ is fully $T_4$
$T$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.
We have that a fully $T_4$ space is also a $T_4$ space.
So:

$T$ is a $T_4$ Space
$T$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space
which is precisely the definition of a normal space.
$\blacksquare$

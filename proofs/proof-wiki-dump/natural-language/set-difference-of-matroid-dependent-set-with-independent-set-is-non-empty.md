Theorem
Let $M = \struct {S, \mathscr I}$ be a matroid.
Let $I$ be an independent subset of $M$.
Let $D$ be a dependent subset of $M$.

Then:

$D \setminus I \ne \O$


Corollary 1
Let $M = \struct {S, \mathscr I}$ be a matroid.
Let $D$ be a dependent subset of $M$.
Let $B$ be a base of $M$.

Then:

$D \setminus B \ne \O$


Corollary 2
Let $M = \struct {S, \mathscr I}$ be a matroid.
Let $I$ be an independent subset of $M$.
Let $C$ be a circuit of $M$.

Then:

$C \setminus I \ne \O$


Corollary 3
Let $M = \struct {S, \mathscr I}$ be a matroid.
Let $B$ be an base of $M$.
Let $C$ be a circuit of $M$.

Then:

$C \setminus B \ne \O$


Proof
From Independent Subset Contains No Dependent Subset:

$D \nsubseteq I$
By definition of subset:

$\exists x \in DÂ : x \notin I$
By definition of set difference:

$\exists x \in D \setminus I$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T$ be the set of theorems of some recursive set of sentences in the language of arithmetic such that $T$ contains minimal arithmetic.

$T$ cannot be both consistent and complete.


Corollary
If $T$ is both consistent and complete, it does not contain minimal arithmetic.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose that such a $T$ is consistent and complete.
By the Undecidability Theorem, since $T$ is consistent and contains $Q$, it is not recursive.
But, by Complete Recursively Axiomatized Theories are Recursive, since $T$ is complete and is the set of theorems of a recursive set, it is recursive.
The result follows by Proof by Contradiction.

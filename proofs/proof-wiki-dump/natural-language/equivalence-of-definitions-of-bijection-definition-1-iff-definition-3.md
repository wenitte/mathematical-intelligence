Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Bijection are equivalent:

Definition 1
A mapping $f: S \to T$ is a bijection if and only if both:

$(1): \quad f$ is an injection
and:

$(2): \quad f$ is a surjection.
Definition 3
A mapping $f: S \to T$ is a bijection if and only if:

the inverse $f^{-1}$ of $f$ is a mapping from $T$ to $S$.


Proof
This is demonstrated in Mapping is Injection and Surjection iff Inverse is Mapping.

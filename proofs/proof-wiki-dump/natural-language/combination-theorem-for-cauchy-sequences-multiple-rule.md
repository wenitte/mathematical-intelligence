Theorem
Let $\struct {R, \norm{\,\cdot\,} }$ be a normed division ring.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $R$.
Let $a \in R$.
Then:

$\sequence {a x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.


Proof
Follows directly from Product Rule for Normed Division Ring Sequences, setting

$\sequence {y_n} := \sequence {x_n}$
and:

$\sequence {x_n} := \tuple {a, a, a, \ldots}$
$\blacksquare$

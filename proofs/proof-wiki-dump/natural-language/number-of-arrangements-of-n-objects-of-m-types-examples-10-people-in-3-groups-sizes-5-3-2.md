Example of Use of Number of Arrangements of $n$ Objects of $m$ Types
Let $N$ be the number of ways $10$ people can be partitioned into $3$ sets: one with $5$, one with $3$ and one with $2$ people.
Then:

$N = 2520$


Proof
Here we have an instance of Number of Arrangements of $n$ Objects into $3$ Types, such that:

$n = 10$
$p = 5$
$q = 3$
$r = 2$

Hence we have:














\(\ds N\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {10!}  {5! \, 3! \, 2!}\)





Number of Arrangements of $n$ Objects into $3$ Types














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {3628800} {120 \times 6 \times 2}\)





Definition of Factorial














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2520\)









Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $f: S \to T$ be an injection.
Let $g: T \to S$ be a left inverse of $f$.

Then $g$ is a surjection.


Proof
Let $f: S \to T$ be an injection.
Then from Injection iff Left Inverse there exists at least one left inverse $g: T \to S$ of $f$ such that $g \circ f = I_S$.
$I_S$ is a surjection.
Thus $g \circ f$ is a surjection.
By Surjection if Composite is Surjection it follows that $g$ is also a surjection.
$\blacksquare$

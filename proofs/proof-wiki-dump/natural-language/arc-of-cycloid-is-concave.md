Theorem
Consider a circle of radius $a$ rolling without slipping along the x-axis of a cartesian plane.
Consider the point $P$ on the circumference of this circle which is at the origin when its center is on the y-axis.
Consider the cycloid traced out by the point $P$.
Let $\tuple {x, y}$ be the coordinates of $P$ as it travels over the plane.

Then the locus of $P$ is concave.


Proof
From Second Derivative of Locus of Cycloid:

$y = -\dfrac a {y^2}$
As $y \ge 0$ throughout, then $y < 0$ wherever $y \ne 0$, which is at the cusps.
The result follows from Second Derivative of Concave Real Function is Non-Positive.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct{B, \vee, \wedge, \neg, \preceq}$ be a finite Boolean lattice.

Then:

$\struct{B, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ is a locale.
Proof
By definition of a lattice:

$B$ admits all finite non-empty suprema and finite non-empty infima.

By definition of a Boolean lattice:

$B$ has a greatest element and a smallest element.
From Infimum of Empty Set is Greatest Element and Supremum of Empty Set is Smallest Element:

$B$ admits empty supremum and empty infimum.

Hence

$B$ admits all supremum and infimum.

By definition of complete lattice:

$B$ is complete
From Complete Boolean Lattice is a Locale:

$B$ is a locale.
$\blacksquare$

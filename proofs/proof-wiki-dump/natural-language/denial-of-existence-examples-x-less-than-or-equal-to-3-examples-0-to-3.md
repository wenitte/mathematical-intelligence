Example of Denial of Universality: $\forall x \in S: x \le 3$
Let $P$ be the statement:

$\exists x \in S: x \le 3$
and $\lnot P$ its negation:

$\forall x \in S: x > 3$

Let $S = \closedint 0 3$ where $\closedint \cdot \cdot$ denotes a closed real interval.
Then we have that:

$P$ is true
and consequently:

$\lnot P$ is false


Proof
The truth of $P$ can be demonstrated by citing $x \in S: x = 2$.
Thus $2$ is an instance of an $x \in S$ such that $x > 3$ that has been shown to exist.
Hence its negation is false.
$\blacksquare$

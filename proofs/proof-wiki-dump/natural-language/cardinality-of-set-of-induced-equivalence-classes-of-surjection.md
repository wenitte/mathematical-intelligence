Theorem
Let $f: S \to T$ be a mapping.
Let $\RR_f \subseteq S \times S$ be the relation induced by $f$:

$\tuple {s_1, s_2} \in \RR_f \iff \map f {s_1} = \map f {s_2}$
Let $f$ be a surjection.

Then there are $\card T$ different $\RR_f$-classes.


Proof
From the definition of a surjection:

$\forall t \in T: \exists s \in S: \map f s = t$
Thus there are as many $\RR_f$-classes of $f$ as there are elements of $T$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

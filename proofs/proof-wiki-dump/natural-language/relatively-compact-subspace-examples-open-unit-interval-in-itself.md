Example of Relatively Compact Subspace
The open unit interval $\openint 0 1$ is not a relatively compact subspace of $\openint 0 1$ itself.


Proof
From Open Real Interval is not Compact, $\openint 0 1$ is not a compact space no matter what topological space it is embedded in.
From Underlying Set of Topological Space is Clopen, $\openint 0 1$ is both closed and open in $\openint 0 1$.
From Set is Closed iff Equals Topological Closure:

$\openint 0 1 = \cl {\openint 0 1}$
The result follows by definition of relatively compact subspace.
$\blacksquare$

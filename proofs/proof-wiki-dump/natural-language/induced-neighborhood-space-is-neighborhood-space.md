Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\tau$ be a topology on $S$, thus forming the topological space $\struct {S, \tau}$.
Let $\struct {S, \NN}$ be the neighborhood space induced by $\struct {S, \tau}$.

Then $\struct {S, \NN}$ is a neighborhood space.


Proof
Let $x \in S$.
Let $\NN_x$ be the neighborhood filter of $x$.
From Basic Properties of Neighborhood in Topological Space, $\NN_x$ fulfils the neighborhood space axioms.
Hence the result.

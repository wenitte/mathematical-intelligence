Theorem
Let $B$ be a body with constant mass $m$ undergoing a force $\mathbf F$.

Then the equation of motion of $B$ is given by:

$\mathbf F = m \mathbf a$
where $\mathbf a$ is the acceleration of $B$.


Proof













\(\ds \mathbf F\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d t} } {m \mathbf v}\)





Newton's Second Law of Motion














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds m \dfrac {\d \mathbf v} {\d t} + \mathbf v \dfrac {\d m} {\d t}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds m \dfrac {\d \mathbf v} {\d t} + 0\)





Derivative of Constant














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds m \mathbf a\)

Example of Mapping which is Not an Injection nor a Surjection
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be the real square function:

$\forall x \in \R: \map f x = x^2$
Then $f$ is neither an injection nor a surjection.


Proof
Consider the real square function:




From Real Square Function is not Injective:

$f$ is not an injection.

From Real Square Function is not Surjective:

$f$ is not a surjection.

Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

To find medial straight lines commensurable in square only which contain a medial rectangle.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $28$)


Proof
Let $\rho$, $\rho \sqrt k$ and $\rho \sqrt \lambda$ be rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Take the mean proportional $\rho \sqrt [4] k$ of $\rho$ and $\rho \sqrt k$, which is medial.
Let $x$ be such that:

$\rho \sqrt k : \rho \sqrt \lambda = \rho \sqrt [4] k : x$
which gives:

$x = \dfrac {\rho \sqrt \lambda} {\sqrt [4] k}$
We have that:

$\rho \sqrt k \frown \!\! - \rho \sqrt \lambda$
where $\frown \!\! -$ denotes commensurability in square only.
Thus:

$\rho \sqrt [4] k \frown \!\! - x$
From Straight Line Commensurable with Medial Straight Line is Medial it follows that $\rho k^{3/4}$ is also medial.
Then:














\(\ds \rho \sqrt \lambda : x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \rho \sqrt k : \rho \sqrt [4] k\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \rho \sqrt [4] k : \rho\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x \cdot \rho \sqrt [4] k\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \rho^2 \sqrt \lambda\)





which is a medial area

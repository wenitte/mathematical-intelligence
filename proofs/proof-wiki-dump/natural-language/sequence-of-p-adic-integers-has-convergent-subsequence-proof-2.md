Theorem
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers for some prime $p$.
Let $\sequence{x_n}$ be a sequence of $p$-adic integers.

Then:

there exists a convergent subsequence $\sequence {x_{n_r} }_{r \mathop \in \N}$ of $\sequence{x_n}$


Proof
From P-adic Integers are Compact Subspace:

$\Z_p$ is a compact subspace in the metric space induced by $\norm{\,\cdot\,}_p$
From Compact Subspace of Metric Space is Sequentially Compact in Itself:

$\Z_p$ is sequentially compact in itself
By definition of sequentially compact in itself:

every sequence in $\Z_p$ has a subsequence which converges in the topology to a point in $\Z_p$
From Equivalence of Definitions of Convergence in Normed Division Rings:

every sequence in $\Z_p$ has a subsequence which converges in the norm to a point in $\Z_p$
$\blacksquare$

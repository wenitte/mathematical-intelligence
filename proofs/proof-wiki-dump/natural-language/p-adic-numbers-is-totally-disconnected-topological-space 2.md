Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers.
Let $\tau_p$ be the topology induced by the non-Archimedean norm $\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$.

Then the topological space $\struct {\Q_p, \tau_p}$ is totally disconnected.


Proof
From P-adic Numbers form Non-Archimedean Valued Field:

$\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$ is a non-Archimedean norm.
From Non-Archimedean Division Ring is Totally Disconnected:

$\struct {\Q_p, \tau_p}$ is totally disconnected.
$\blacksquare$

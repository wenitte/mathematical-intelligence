Theorem
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $p, q \in X$.

Then path homotopy on the set of all paths in $X$ from $p$ to $q$ is an equivalence relation.


Proof
Suppose $X$ is a topological space.
Let $p, q \in X$.
Let $\sim$ denote the path homotopy on the set of all paths in $X$ from $p$ to $q$.

Thus $\sim$ is seen to be reflexive.
$\Box$

Thus $\sim$ is seen to be transitive.
$\Box$

$\sim$ has been shown to be reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
Hence the result.

Example of Order of Finite Abelian Group with $p+$ Order $p$ Elements is Divisible by $p^2$
Let $G$ be a finite abelian group whose identity is $e$.
Let $G$ have more than $2$ elements of order $3$.
Then:

$9 \divides \order G$
where:

$\divides$ denotes divisibility
$\order G$ denotes the order of $G$.


Proof
An example of Order of Finite Abelian Group with $p+$ Order $p$ Elements is Divisible by $p^2$, setting $p = 3$.
$\blacksquare$

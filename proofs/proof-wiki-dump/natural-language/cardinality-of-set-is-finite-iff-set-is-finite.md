Theorem
Let $A$ be a set.

$\card A$ is finite
if and only if:

$A$ is finite
where $\card A$ denotes the cardinality of $A$.


Proof
Definition of cardinal:

$(1): \quad \card A \sim A$
$\card A$ is finite
if and only if:

$\exists n \in \N: \card A \sim \N_n$ by definition of finite set
if and only if:

$\exists n \in \N: A \sim \N_n$ by $(1)$ and Set Equivalence behaves like Equivalence Relation
if and only if:

$A$ is finite by definition of finite set.
$\blacksquare$

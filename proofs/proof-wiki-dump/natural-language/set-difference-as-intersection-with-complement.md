Theorem
Set difference can be expressed as the intersection with the set complement:

$A \setminus B = A \cap \map \complement B$


Proof
This follows directly from Set Difference as Intersection with Relative Complement:

$A \setminus B = A \cap \relcomp S B$
Let $S = \Bbb U$.
Since $A, B \subseteq \Bbb U$ by definition of the universal set, the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

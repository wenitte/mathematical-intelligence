Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\RR \subseteq S \times S$ be an equivalence relation on $S$.
Let $q_\RR: S \to S / \RR$ be the quotient mapping induced by $\RR$.
Let $\tau_\RR$ be the quotient topology on $S / \RR$ by $q_\RR$.

Then $\tau_\RR$ is a topology on $S$.


Proof
By definition of quotient topology, $\tau_\RR$ is the identification topology on $S / \RR$ with respect to $q_\RR$ and $\struct {S, \tau}$.
Identification Topology is Topology shows that $\tau_\RR$ is a topology on $S / \RR$.

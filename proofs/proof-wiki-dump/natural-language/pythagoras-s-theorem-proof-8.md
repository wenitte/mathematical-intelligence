Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a right triangle with $c$ as the hypotenuse.
Then:

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$


Proof
Let $\Box ABCD$ be an arbitrary rectangle with opposing sides $AB = CD$ and $AD = BC$.

Let $O$ be the point where the diameters of $\Box ABCD$ meet.
By Diagonals of Rectangle are Equal:

$AC = BD$
By Diameters of Parallelogram Bisect each other:

$OA = OB = OC = OD$
Let a circle be constructed on center $O$ with radius $OA$.
Then $\Box ABCD$ is inscribed in the circle.
This also follows from the converse to Thales' Theorem.

By Ptolemy's Theorem:

$AD \cdot BC + AB \cdot CD = AC \cdot BD$
But $AD = BC$ and $AB = CD$ and $AC = BD$ so:

$AD \cdot AD + AB \cdot AB = AC \cdot AC$
Hence the result follows.

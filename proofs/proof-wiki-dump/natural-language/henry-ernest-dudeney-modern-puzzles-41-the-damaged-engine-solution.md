Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $41$
The Damaged Engine
We were going by train from Anglechester to Clinkerton, and an hour after starting some accident happened to the engine.
We had to continue the journey at $\tfrac 3 5$ of the former speed, and it made us $2$ hours late at Clinkerton,
and the driver said that if only the accident had happened $50$ miles farther on the train would have arrived $40$ minutes sooner.
Can you tell from that statement just how far it is from Anglechester to Clinkerton?


Solution
$200$ miles, of which the first $50$ miles were at $50$ miles per hour, and the rest at $30$ miles per hour.


Proof
Let $d$ miles be the distance from Anglechester to Clinkerton.
Let $v$ miles per hour be the speed of the train when working properly.
Let $d_1$ miles be the distance from Anglechester to where the train malfunctioned.
Let $t$ hours be the time the train would normally take to travel the journey.

We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds v t\)










\(\text {(1')}: \quad\)









\(\ds d_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds v\)





an hour after starting some accident happened to the engine.




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \dfrac {d_1} v + \dfrac {d - d_1} {v \times \tfrac 3 5}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t + 2\)





We had to continue ... $2$ hours late at Clinkerton




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \dfrac {d_1 + 50} v + \dfrac {d - d_1 - 50} {v \times \tfrac 3 5}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t + 1 \tfrac 1 3\)





the driver said ... $40$ minutes sooner




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 d - 2 d_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 v t + 6 v\)





simplifying $(2)$




\(\text {(5)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 5 d - 2 d_1 - 100\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 v t + 4 v\)





simplifying $(3)$




\(\text {(6)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 100\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 v\)





$(4) - (5)$




\(\text {(7)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 d - 2 d_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 150 t + 300\)





substituting for $v$ in $(5)$ or $(6)$ and simplifying




\(\text {(8)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 d - 2 d_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 300\)





substituting for $t$ in $(7)$ and simplifying




\(\text {(9)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 d - 100\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 300\)





substituting for $d_1 = v$ in $(8)$




\(\text {(10)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 200\)

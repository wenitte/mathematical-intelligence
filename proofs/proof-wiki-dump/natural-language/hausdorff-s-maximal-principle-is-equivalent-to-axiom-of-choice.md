Theorem
Every ordered set has a maximal chain if and only if the axiom of choice holds.


Proof
Axiom of Choice implies Hausdorff's Maximal Principle
Hausdorff's Maximal Principle implies Zermelo's Well-Ordering Theorem
Zermelo's Well-Ordering Theorem is Equivalent to Axiom of Choice
$\blacksquare$

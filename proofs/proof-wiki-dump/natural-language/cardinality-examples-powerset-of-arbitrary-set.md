Example of Cardinality
Let:

$S_4 = \set {X \in \powerset {S_2}: \card X = 3}$
where $S_2 = \set {x \in \Z: 0 < x < 6}$.

The cardinality of $S_4$ is given by:

$\card {S_4} = 10$


Proof
By Cardinality of $S_2$, we have that:

$\card {S_2} = 5$
Then:














\(\ds \card {S_4}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {5!} {2! \, 3!}\)





Cardinality of Set of Subsets














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {120} {2 \times 3}\)





Definition of Factorial














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dbinom 5 3\)





Binomial Theorem














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)









Hence the result by definition of cardinality.

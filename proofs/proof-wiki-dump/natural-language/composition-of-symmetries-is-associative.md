Theorem
Let $P$ be a geometric figure.
Let $S_P$ be the set of all symmetries of $P$.
Let $\circ$ denote composition of mappings.
Let $\phi, \psi, \chi$ be symmetries of $P$.

Then:

$\paren {\phi \circ \psi} \circ \chi = \phi \circ \paren {\psi \circ \chi}$
That is, composition of symmetries is associative.


Proof
From Composition of Symmetries is Symmetry:

$\paren {\phi \circ \psi} \circ \chi$ is a symmetry
and:

$\phi \circ \paren {\psi \circ \chi}$ is a symmetry.
It follows from Composition of Mappings is Associative that:

$\paren {\phi \circ \psi} \circ \chi = \phi \circ \paren {\psi \circ \chi}$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let the Axiom of Replacement (in the context of class theory) be accepted.
Let $A$ be a class which can be put into one-to-one correspondence with a set.

Then $A$ is a set.


Proof
Let $x$ be a set such that $A$ can be put into one-to-one correspondence with $x$.
Then by definition there exists a bijection from $x$ to $A$.
Let $f: x \to A$ be such a bijection.
Then by the Axiom of Replacement, $f \sqbrk x$ is a set.
But:

$f \sqbrk x = A$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

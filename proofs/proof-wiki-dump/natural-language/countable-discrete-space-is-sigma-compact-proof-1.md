Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a countable discrete topological space.

Then $T$ is $\sigma$-compact.


Proof
We have that Singleton Set in Discrete Space is Compact.
We also have that $S$ is the union of all its singleton sets:

$\ds S = \bigcup_{x \mathop \in S} \set x$
As $S$ is countable, it is the union of countably many compact sets.
Hence the result, by definition of $\sigma$-compact.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be straight lines in the Cartesian plane.
Let the slope of $L_1$ and $L_2$ be $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ respectively.

Then $L_1$ is parallel to $L_2$ if and only if:

$\mu_1 = \mu_2$


Proof 1
Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be described by the general equation: 










\(\ds L_1: \, \)



\(\ds l_1 x + m_1 y + n_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)
















\(\ds L_2: \, \)



\(\ds l_2 x + m_2 y + n_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)










Then:

the slope of $L_1$ is $\mu_1 = -\dfrac {l_1} {m_1}$
the slope of $L_2$ is $\mu_2 = -\dfrac {l_2} {m_2}$.
From Condition for Straight Lines in Plane to be Parallel: General Equation:

$L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel if and only if $L_2$ is given by the equation:
$m_1 x + m_2 y = n'$
for some $n'$.
But then the slope of $L_2$ is $-\dfrac {l_1} {m_1}$.
That is:

$-\dfrac {l_1} {m_1} = -\dfrac {l_2} {m_2}$
and the result follows.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be embedded in a cartesian plane, given by the equations:








\(\ds L_1: \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m_1 x + c_1\)














\(\ds L_2: \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m_2 x + c_2\)










Let $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ be the angles that $L_1$ and $L_2$ make with the $x$-axis respectively.
Then by definition of slope of a straight line:














\(\ds \tan \psi_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m_1\)




















\(\ds \tan \psi_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m_2\)











Necessary Condition
Let $m_1 = m_2$.
Then:

$\tan \psi_1 = \tan \psi_2$
and so:

$\psi_1 = \psi_2 + n \pi$
The multiple of $\pi$ makes no difference.
Thus from Equal Corresponding Angles implies Parallel Lines, $L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel.
$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Suppose $L_1 \parallel L_2$.
Then:














\(\ds \phi_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \phi_2\)





Parallelism implies Equal Corresponding Angles








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \tan \phi_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tan \phi_2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m_2\)









$\blacksquare$


Proof 3
Let $\psi$ be the angle between $L_1$ and $L_2$
When $L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel:

$\psi = 0$
by definition.
From Angle between Straight Lines in Plane:

$\psi = \arctan \dfrac {m_1 - m_2} {1 + m_1 m_2}$
The result follows immediately.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the third binomial, the "side" of the area is the irrational straight line called a second bimedial.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $56$)


Proof

Let the rectangular area $ABCD$ be contained by the rational straight line $AB$ and the third binomial $AD$.
Let $E$ divide $AD$ into its terms such that $AE > ED$.
From Proposition $42$ of Book $\text{X} $: Binomial Straight Line is Divisible into Terms Uniquely this is possible at only one place.
By definition of binomial, $AE$ and $ED$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Thus $AE^2$ is greater than $ED^2$ by the square on a straight line which is commensurable with $AE$.
By Book $\text{X (II)}$ Definition $3$: Third Binomial, neither of the terms $AE$ and $ED$ is commensurable in length with $AB$.
Let $ED$ be bisected at $F$.
Using Proposition $29$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Construction of Parallelogram Equal to Given Figure Exceeding a Parallelogram:

Let a parallelogram be applied to $AE$ equal to $EF^2$ and deficient by a square.
Let the rectangle contained by $AG$ and $GE$ equal to $EF^2$ be applied to $AE$.
By Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{X} $: Condition for Commensurability of Roots of Quadratic Equation:

$AG$ is commensurable in length with $EG$.
Let $GH$, $EK$ and $FL$ be drawn from $G$, $E$ and $F$ parallel to $AB$ and $CD$.
Using Proposition $14$ of Book $\text{II} $: Construction of Square equal to Given Polygon:

let the square $SN$ be constructed equal to the parallelogram $AH$
and:

let the square $NQ$ be constructed equal to the parallelogram $GK$.
Let $SN$ and $NQ$ be placed so that $MN$ is in a straight line with $NO$.
Therefore $RN$ is also in a straight line with $NP$.
Let the parallelogram $SQ$ be completed.
From Lemma to Proposition $54$ of Book $\text{X} $: Root of Area contained by Rational Straight Line and First Binomial:

$SQ$ is a square.
We have that $AD$ is a third binomial straight line.
Therefore $AE$ and $ED$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
We have that the rectangle contained by $AG$ and $GE$ is equal to $EF^2$.
Then by Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Rectangles Contained by Three Proportional Straight Lines:

$AG : EF = EF : EG$
and so by Proposition $1$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Areas of Triangles and Parallelograms Proportional to Base:

$AH : EL = EL : KG$
Therefore $EL$ is a mean proportional between $AH$ and $GK$.
But:

$AH = SN$
and:

$GK = NQ$
therefore $EL$ is a mean proportional between $SN$ and $NQ$.
But from Lemma to Proposition $54$ of Book $\text{X} $: Root of Area contained by Rational Straight Line and First Binomial:

$MR$ is a mean proportional between $SN$ and $NQ$.
Therefore:

$EL = MR$
and so:

$EL = PO$
But:

$AH + GK = SN + NQ$
Therefore:

$AC = SQ$
That is:

$AC$ is an area contained by a rational straight line $AB$ and the first binomial $AD$, while the side of the area $SQ$ is $MO$.

We have that:

$AE$ is incommensurable in length with $ED$
and:

$ED$ is commensurable in length with $AB$
it follows from Proposition $13$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurable Magnitudes are Incommensurable with Same Magnitude:

$AE$ is incommensurable in length with $AB$.
As:

$AG$ is commensurable in length with $EG$
from Proposition $15$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Sum of Commensurable Magnitudes:

$AE$ is commensurable in length with each of $AG$ and $GE$.
But $AE$ is incommensurable in length with $AB$.
So from Proposition $13$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurable Magnitudes are Incommensurable with Same Magnitude:

$AG$ and $GE$ are incommensurable in length with $AB$.
Therefore:

$BA$ and $AG$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only
and:

$BA$ and $GE$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Therefore by definition rectangles $AH$ and $GK$ are both medial.
Therefore squares $SN$ and $NQ$ are both medial.
Therefore $MN$ and $NO$ are both medial straight lines.

It remains to be demonstrated that $MO$ is second bimedial.
We have that:

$DE$ is incommensurable in length with $AB = EK$
and:

$DE$ is commensurable with $EF$
so from Proposition $13$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurable Magnitudes are Incommensurable with Same Magnitude:

$EF$ is incommensurable in length with $EK$.
Both $EF$ and $EK$ are rational straight lines.
Therefore $EF$ and $EK$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Therefore, by definition, $EL = MR$ are medial.
But $MR$ is the rectangle contained by $MN$ and $MO$.
But $MN$ and $NO$ have been shown to be medial and commensurable in square.
Therefore, by definition, $MN$ and $NO$ are medial and commensurable in square only.
By definition, $MO$ is a second bimedial straight line.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $56$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $62$: Square on Second Bimedial Straight Line applied to Rational Straight Line.

Theorem
Let $\phi: \struct {R_1, +_1, \circ_1} \to \struct {R_2, +_2, \circ_2}$ be a ring epimorphism.
Let $K = \map \ker \phi$ be the kernel of $\phi$.

$\phi$ is an isomorphism if and only if $K = \set {0_{R_1} }$.


Proof
From Kernel is Trivial iff Monomorphism, $\phi$ is a ring monomorphism if and only if $K = \set {0_{R_1} }$.
As $\phi$ is also an epimorphism, the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

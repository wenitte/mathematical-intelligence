Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If magnitudes be proportional separando, they will also be proportional componendo.
(The Elements: Book $\text{V}$: Proposition $18$)

That is:

$a : b = c : d \implies \paren {a + b} : b = \paren {c + d} : d$


Proof
Let $AE, EB, CF, FD$ be magnitudes which are proportional separando, that is:

$AE : EB = CF : FD$
We need to show that they are also proportional componendo, that is:

$AB : BE = CD : FD$

Suppose $CD : DF \ne AB : BE$.
Then as $AB : BE$ so will $CD$ be to some magnitude less than $DF$ or greater.
Suppose that it be in that ratio to a less magnitude $DG$.
Then since $AB : BE = CD : DG$ it follows from Magnitudes Proportional Compounded are Proportional Separated that:

$AE : EB = CG : GD$
But by hypothesis:

$AE : EB = CF : FD$
So by Equality of Ratios is Transitive we have that:

$CG : GD = CF : FD$
But $CG > CF$.
Therefore $GD > FD$ from Relative Sizes of Components of Ratios.
But it is also less, which is impossible.
Therefore as $AB$ is to $BE$, so is not $CD$ to a lesser magnitude than $FD$.
Similarly we can show that neither is it in that ratio to a greater.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $18$ of Book $\text{V}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{V} $: Magnitudes Proportional Compounded are Proportional Separated.

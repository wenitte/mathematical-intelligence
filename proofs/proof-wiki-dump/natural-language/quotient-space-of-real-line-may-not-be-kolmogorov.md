Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau}$ denote the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.

Then there exists an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\R$ such that the quotient space $\struct {\R / {\sim}, \tau_\sim}$ is not Kolmogorov.


Proof
By Quotient Space of Real Line may be Indiscrete, there is an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\R$ such that the quotient space $\struct {\R / {\sim}, \tau_\sim}$ has two points and is indiscrete.
It follows directly from the definition of Kolmogorov space that $\struct {\R / {\sim}, \tau_\sim}$ is not a Kolmogorov space.

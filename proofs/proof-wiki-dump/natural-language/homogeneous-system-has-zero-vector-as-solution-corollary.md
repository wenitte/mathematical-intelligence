Corollary to Homogeneous System has Zero Vector as Solution
Every homogeneous system of linear equations is consistent.


Proof
From Homogeneous System has Zero Vector as Solution, every homogeneous system of linear equations has the zero vector as a solution.

The result follows from the definition of consistency.

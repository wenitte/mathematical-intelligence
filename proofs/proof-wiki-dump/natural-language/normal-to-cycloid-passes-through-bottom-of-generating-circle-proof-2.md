Theorem
Let $C$ be a cycloid generated by the equations:

$x = a \paren {\theta - \sin \theta}$
$y = a \paren {1 - \cos \theta}$
Then the normal to $C$ at a point $P$ on $C$ passes through the bottom of the generating circle of $C$.


Proof
From Tangent to Cycloid passes through Top of Generating Circle, the tangent to $C$ at a point $P = \tuple {x, y}$ passes through the top of the generating circle.
By definition, the normal to $C$ at $P$ is perpendicular to the tangent to $C$ at $P$.
From Thales' Theorem, the normal, the tangent and the diameter of the generating circle form a right triangle.
Thus the normal to $C$ at $P$ meets the generating circle at the opposite end of the diameter to the tangent.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

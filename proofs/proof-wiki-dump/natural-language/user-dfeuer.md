Proof that $0 + 1 = 0$
Using Von Neumann Natural Numbers:

$0 = \varnothing$
Let $f: \N \to \N$ be the successor mapping. That is, let $f(x) = x^+$.
Then $f(0)$ is the image of the empty set under $f$, so $f(0) = f(\varnothing) = \varnothing = 0$.
Thus $0^+ = 0$.
So by the definition of addition, $0 + 1 = 0$.
$\blacksquare$

What is math?
Mathematics is a family of creative games. The players, called mathematicians, can score points in the game by making any of several different plays. The primary plays are proving theorems and finding counterexamples to conjectures. Secondary plays include creating new subgames or game variants and forming conjectures that drive game-play.

Etymological Dictionary of PW User Names
Dfeuer < D. Feuer < Feuerwerger, a Germanic name < feuer (fire) + werker (worker)
prime.mover < prime (original) + mover, from the notion that all actions were ultimately initiated by God. Cf. first cause (although, given the paltry level of politico-social sophistication of the user in question, coupled with his egregious lack of respect for and ignorance of history, classics and education in general, more likely stolen from the title of a song by the über-macho goth/punk/sleaze band Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction)
Lord_Farin < Farin, a character in the Lord of the Rings lore.
Anghel < "messenger", a Romanian name that can be used both as a first name and a surname.

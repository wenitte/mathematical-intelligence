Theorem
Let $\mathbf{Frm}$ denote the category of frames.

Let $L_1 = \struct{S_1, \preceq_1}$ and $L_2 = \struct{S_2, \preceq_2}$ be frames.
Let $\phi: S_1 \to S_2$ be a mapping between the underlying sets of $L_1$ and $L_2$.

Then $\phi$ is a frame isomorphism if and only if $\phi$ is an isomorphism in $\mathbf{Frm}$.


Proof
$\blacksquare$

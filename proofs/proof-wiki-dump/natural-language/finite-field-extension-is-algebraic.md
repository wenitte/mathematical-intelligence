Theorem
Let $L / K$ be a finite field extension.

Then $L / K$ is algebraic.


Proof
Let $x \in L$ be arbitrary.
Let $n = \index L K$ be the degree of $L$ over $K$.
From Size of Linearly Independent Subset is at Most Size of Finite Generator, there is a $K$-linear combination of $\set {1, \ldots, x^n}$ equal to $0$.
Say $a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0$, $a_i \in K$, $i = 0, \ldots, n$.
Therefore $x$ satisfies a polynomial with coefficients in $K$.

That is, $x$ is algebraic.
Since $x \in L$ was chosen arbitrarily, $L / K$ is algebraic.

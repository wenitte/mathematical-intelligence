This article has been proposed for deletion.In particular: The way the links are configured, this is exactly the same as Power Set of Natural Numbers has Cardinality of Continuum. What we do not have is Cardinality of Real Numbers is Cardinality of Continuu, which follows from Continuum has Cardinality of Continuum and Real Number Line is Continuous.Please assess the validity of this proposal.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.
Theorem
The cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers is equal to the cardinality of the real numbers.


Proof
This is a direct corollary of Power Set of Natural Numbers has Cardinality of Continuum.
$\blacksquare$

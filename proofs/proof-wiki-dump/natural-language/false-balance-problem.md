Classic Problem
A Cheshire cheese being put into one of the pans of a false balance,
was found to weigh $16$ pounds,
and when put into the other pan only $9$ pounds.
What is the true weight?


Solution
$12$ pounds.


Proof
It is assumed that the reason for the falseness of this balance is that its arms are of unequal lengths.
Let $W$ pounds be the true weight.
Let the arms of the balance be $p$ and $q$.
From True Weight from False Balance with Unequal Arms:

$W = \sqrt {p q}$

Thus we have:














\(\ds W\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {16 \times 9}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 3\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)









$\blacksquare$

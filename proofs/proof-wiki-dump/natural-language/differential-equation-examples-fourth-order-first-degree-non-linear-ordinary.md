Example of Differential Equation
Ordinary non-linear differential equation of the $4$th order and $1$st degree:

$x \dfrac {\d^4 y} {\d x^4} + 2 \dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2} + \paren {x \dfrac {\d y} {\d x} }^5 = x^3$


Proof
The term in $\dfrac {\d y} {\d x}$ is raised to the $5$th degree and so the equation is non-linear.
The term in $\dfrac {\d^4 y} {\d x^4}$ is raised to the $1$st degree.
The result follows by definition of degree.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $x$ be a non-empty set.
Let $\bigcap x$ denote the intersection of $x$.

Then $\bigcap x$ is a set.


Proof
It is assumed that $x$ is an element of a basic universe.
Hence from the Axiom of Transitivity, every set is a class.
Hence Intersection of Non-Empty Class is Set applies directly.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Non-Square Positive Integers not Sum of Square and Prime
$34$ cannot be expressed as the sum of a square and a prime.


Proof
Testing each $m \in \Z_{>0}$ such that $m^2 < 34$ it is established that there is no solution to $34 - m^2 = p$ where $p$ is prime:














\(\ds 34 - 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 33\)





which is composite: $33 = 3 \times 11$














\(\ds 34 - 4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 30\)





which is composite: $30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5$














\(\ds 34 - 9\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25\)





which is composite: $25 = 5^2$














\(\ds 34 - 16\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 18\)





which is composite: $18 = 2 \times 3^2$














\(\ds 34 - 25\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9\)





which is composite: $9 = 3^2$



$\blacksquare$

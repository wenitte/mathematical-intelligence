Theorem
Let $S$ be a strictly stationary stochastic process giving rise to a time series $T$.
Let $\sequence {s_n}$ be a sequence of $n$ successive values of $T$:

$\sequence {s_n} = \tuple {z_1, z_2, \dotsb, z_n}$
Let $L_t$ be a linear function of $\sequence {s_n}$:

$L_t = l_1 z_t + l_2 z_{t - 1} + \dotsb + l_n z_{t - n + 1}$

Then $L_t$ is itself stationary.


Proof
Follows by definition of stationarity.

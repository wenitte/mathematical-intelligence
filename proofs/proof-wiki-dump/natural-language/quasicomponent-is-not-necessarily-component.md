Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $Q$ be a quasicomponent of $T$.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $C$ is also a component of $T$.


Proof
From Component of Point is not always Intersection of its Clopen Sets, the set intersection of the clopen sets containing a point $x$ may not always be contained in the component of $x$.
The result follows from Quasicomponent is Intersection of Clopen Sets.
$\blacksquare$

Lemma to Circle Circumscribing Pentagon of Dodecahedron and Triangle of Icosahedron in Same Sphere
In the words of Hypsicles of Alexandria:

If an equilateral and equiangular pentagon be inscribed in a circle, the sum of the squares on the straight line subtending two sides and on the side of the pentagon is five times the square on the radius.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XIV}$: Proposition $2$ : Lemma)


Proof

Let $ABC$ be a circle.
Let $AC$ be the side of a regular pentagon which has been inscribed within $ABC$.
Let $D$ be the center of the circle $ABC$.
Let $DF$ be drawn from $D$ perpendicular to $AC$, and produce it both ways to meet $ABC$ in $B$ and $E$.
Let $AB$ and $AE$ be joined.
It is to be demonstrated that:

$BA^2 + AC^2 = 5 \cdot DE^2$

We have that:














\(\ds BE\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \cdot ED\)










\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \therefore \ \ \)





\(\ds BE^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \cdot ED^2\)









Also:














\(\ds \angle BAE\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 90^\circ\)





Thales' Theorem








\(\ds \therefore \ \ \)





\(\ds AB^2 + AE^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds BE^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem








\(\ds \therefore \ \ \)





\(\ds AB^2 + AE^2 + ED^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 \cdot ED^2\)





from $(1)$



But from Proposition $10$ of Book $\text{XIII} $: Square on Side of Regular Pentagon inscribed in Circle equals Squares on Sides of Hexagon and Decagon inscribed in same Circle:

$AC^2 = DE^2 + EA^2$
Therefore:

$BA^2 + AC^2 = 5 \cdot DE^2$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $2$ of Book $\text{XIV}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

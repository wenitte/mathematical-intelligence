Theorem
Let $D$ be the Hasse diagram of an ordering $\RR$.
Then the Hasse diagram $D'$ of the dual ordering $\RR^{-1}$ of $\RR$ is obtained by turning $D$ upside down.


Proof
Let $\tuple {x, y}$ be an ordered pair in $\RR$ which is represented by a line in $D$ joining $x$ and $y$ such that $x$ is below $y$.
Then $x \mathrel \RR y$ such that:

$\not \exists z: x \mathrel \RR z \land \mathrel \RR y$
As $\RR^{-1}$ is the dual of $\RR$, we have that $y \mathrel {\RR^{-1} } x$ such that:

$\not \exists z: y \mathrel {\RR^{-1} } z \land \mathrel {\RR^{-1} }$
and so there will be a line in $D'$ joining $x$ and $y$ such that $x$ is above $y$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$\paren {p \iff q} \iff q \dashv \vdash p$


Proof













\(\ds \paren {p \iff q} \iff q\)

\(\dashv \vdash\)







\(\ds p \iff \paren {q \iff q}\)





Biconditional is Associative














\(\ds \)

\(\dashv \vdash\)







\(\ds p \iff \top\)





Biconditional with Itself














\(\ds \)

\(\dashv \vdash\)







\(\ds p\)

Example of Bijection
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be the mapping defined on the set of real numbers as:

$\forall x \in \R: \map f x = 2 x + 1$
Then $f$ is a bijection.


Proof
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be real numbers.
Then:














\(\ds \map f {x_1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {x_2}\)





by supposition








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 x_1 + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 x_2 + 1\)





Definition of $f$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x_2\)









Hence by definition $f$ is an injection.
$\Box$

Let $y \in \R$.
Let $x = \dfrac {y - 1} 2$.
We have that:

$x \in \R$
$\map f x = y$
Hence by definition $f$ is a surjection.
$\Box$

Thus $f$ is both an injection and a surjection, and so a bijection.
$\blacksquare$

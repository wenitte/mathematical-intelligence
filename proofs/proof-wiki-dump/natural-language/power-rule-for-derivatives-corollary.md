Corollary to Power Rule for Derivatives
Let $n \in \R$.
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be the real function defined as $\map f x = x^n$.

Then:

$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {c x^n} = n c x^{n - 1}$
everywhere that $\map f x = x^n$ is defined.


Proof













\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {c x^n}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c \, \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {x^n}\)





Derivative of Constant Multiple














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds n c x^{n - 1}\)

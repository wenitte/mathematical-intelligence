The Weight of the Fish
A man caught a fish.
The tail weighed $9$ ounces.
The head weighed as much as the tail and half the body,
and the body weighed as much as the head and tail together.
What is the weight of the fish?


Solution
$72$ ounces, or $4 \tfrac 1 2$ pounds.


Proof
Let $t$, $h$ and $b$ denote the weights in ounces of tail, head and body respectively.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9\)





The tail weighed $9$ ounces.




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds h\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t + \dfrac b 2\)





The head weighed as much as the tail and half the body,




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds h + t\)





and the body weighed as much as the head and tail together.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds h\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 + \dfrac {h + 9} 2\)





substituting from $(1)$ and $(3)$ into $(2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds h\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 27\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 27 + 9 = 36\)





substituting into $(3)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds h + b + t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 27 + 9 + 36 = 72\)





totting them up



The weight in pounds can be calculated from the conversion factor of $16$ ounces to the pound.

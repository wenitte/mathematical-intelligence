Theorem
Let $T = \struct {\R, \tau}$ be the compact complement topology on $\R$.

Then $T$ is a separable space.


Proof 1
We have:

Compact Complement Topology is Second-Countable
Second-Countable Space is Separable
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
We have that:

Rationals are Dense in Compact Complement Topology
Rational Numbers are Countably Infinite
Hence the result by definition of separable space.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $D$ be a deck of $52$ cards.
Let $D$ be given a sequence of modified perfect faro shuffles.
Then after $52$ such shuffles, the cards of $D$ will be in the same order they started in.


Proof
From Number of Modified Perfect Faro Shuffles to return Deck of Cards to Original Order, the cards of $D$ will return to their original order after $n$ such shuffles, where:

$2^n \equiv 1 \pmod {53}$
By Fermat's Little Theorem:

$2^{52} \equiv 1 \pmod {53}$
So the cards of $D$ will return to their original order after $52$ modified perfect faro shuffles.
$\blacksquare$

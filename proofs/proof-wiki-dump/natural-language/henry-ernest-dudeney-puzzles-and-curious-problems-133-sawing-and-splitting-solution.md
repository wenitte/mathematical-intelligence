Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $133$
Sawing and Splitting
Two men can saw $5$ cords of wood per day,
or they can split $8$ cords of wood when sawed.
How many cords must they saw in order that they may be occupied for the rest of the day in splitting it?


Solution
$3 \tfrac 1 {13}$ cords


Proof
Let $n$ be the number of cords they are to work on.
We have that:

$\dfrac n 5 + \dfrac n 8 = 1$
from which we get:

$8 n + 5 n = 40$
That is:

$n = \dfrac {40} {13} = 3 \tfrac 1 {13}$
$\blacksquare$

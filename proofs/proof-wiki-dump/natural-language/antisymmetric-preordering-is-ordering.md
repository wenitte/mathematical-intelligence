Theorem
Let $\RR \subseteq S \times S$ be a preordering on a set $S$.
Let $\RR$ also be antisymmetric.

Then $\RR$ is an ordering on $S$.


Proof
By definition, a preordering on $S$ is a relation on $S$ which is:

$(1): \quad$ reflexive
and:

$(2): \quad$ transitive.

Thus $\RR$ is a relation on $S$ which is reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric.
Thus by definition $\RR$ is an ordering on $S$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle whose incenter is $H$.
Then the pedal circle of $H$ is the incircle of $\triangle ABC$.


Proof
Let $\CC$ denote the incircle of $\triangle ABC$.
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $\CC$ is not the pedal circle of $H$.
By definition, the sides of $\triangle ABC$ are tangent to $\CC$.
Hence from Line at Right Angles to Diameter of Circle: Porism, the line through $H$ to those point of tangency to $\CC$ are perpendicular to the sides.
Hence $\CC$ is the pedal circle of $H$ by definition.
Hence by Proof by Contradiction, the pedal circle of $H$ is the incircle.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\mathbf E$ be an elementary row matrix.
Then $\mathbf E$ is nonsingular.


Proof
From Elementary Row Matrix for Inverse of Elementary Row Operation is Inverse it is demonstrated that:

if $\mathbf E$ is the elementary row matrix corresponding to an elementary row operation $e$
then:

the inverse of $e$ corresponds to an elementary row matrix which is the inverse of $\mathbf E$.
So as $\mathbf E$ has an inverse, a fortiori it is nonsingular.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T$ be a topological space.
Let $A \subseteq T$.

Then:

$A$ is dense-in-itself
if and only if:

$A \subseteq A'$
where

$A'$ denotes the derivative of $A$.


Proof
$\qquad A$ is dense-in-itself
$\leadstoandfrom$ every $x \in A$ is not an isolated point in $A$ by definition of dense-in-itself
$\leadstoandfrom$ every $x \in A$ is an accumulation point of $A$ by Point is Isolated iff not Accumulation Point
$\leadstoandfrom$ every $x \in A$ is an element of $A'$ by definition of derivative
$\leadstoandfrom A \subseteq A'$ by definition of subset.
$\blacksquare$

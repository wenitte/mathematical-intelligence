Theorem
Let $S$ and $T$ be sets.
Let $f: S \to T$ and $g: T \to S$ be inverse mappings of each other.

Then $f$ and $g$ are bijections.


Proof
From Inverse is Mapping implies Mapping is Injection and Surjection:

$f$ is both an injection and a surjection.

Again from Inverse is Mapping implies Mapping is Injection and Surjection:

$g$ is both an injection and a surjection.

The result follows by definition of bijection.
$\blacksquare$

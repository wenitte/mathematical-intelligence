Example of Preimage of Subset under Mapping
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be the mapping defined as:

$\forall x \in \R: \map f x = x^2 - x - 2$
The preimage of the closed interval $\closedint {-5} {-4}$ is:

$f^{-1} \closedint {-2} 0 = \O$
the Empty Set


Proof
Trivially, by differentiating $x^2 - x - 2$ with respect to $x$:

$f' = 2 x - 1$
and equating $f'$ to $0$, the minimum of $\Img f$ is seen to occur at $\map f {\dfrac 1 2} = -\dfrac 9 4$.
We see that $\closedint {-5} {-4}$ is well outside the image of $f$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

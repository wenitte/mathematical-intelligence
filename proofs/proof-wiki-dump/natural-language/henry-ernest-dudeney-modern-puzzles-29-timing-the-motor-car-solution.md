Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $29$
Timing the Motor-car
"I was walking along the road at $3 \tfrac 1 2$ miles an hour," said Mr. Pipkins,
"when the motor-car dashed past me and only missed me by a few inches."
"Do you know what speed it was going?" asked his friend.
"Well, from the moment it passed me to its disappearance round a corner I took $27$ steps, and walking on reached that corner with $135$ steps more."
"Then, assuming you walked, and the car ran, each at a uniform rate, we can easily work out the speed."


Solution
$21$ miles an hour.


Proof
Let $v$ be the speed of the motor-car.
Let $d$ be the distance to the corner from where the near-accident happened.
Let $t$ be the time it takes Pipkins to take $1$ step.
We have:

$v = \dfrac d {27 t}$
while Pipkins' speed gives:

$3 \tfrac 1 2 = \dfrac d {\paren {27 + 135} t}$
which leads us to:

$v = 6 \times 3 \tfrac 1 2$
and the answer.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $G = \gen g$ be a cyclic group with generator $g$.
Let $H$ be a group.
Let $\phi: G \to H$ be a (group) homomorphism.
Let $\map \ker \phi$ denote the kernel of $\phi$.
Let $\Img G$ denote the homomorphic image of $G$ under $\phi$.

Then:

$\map \ker \phi = \gen {g^m}$
where:

$m = 0$ if $\Img \phi$ is an infinite cyclic group
$m = \order {\Img \phi}$ if $\Img \phi$ is a finite cyclic group.


Proof
From Kernel of Group Homomorphism is Subgroup and Subgroup of Cyclic Group is Cyclic:

$\exists m \in \N: \map \ker \phi = \gen {g^m}$
From Homomorphic Image of Cyclic Group is Cyclic Group:

$\Img \phi$ is a cyclic group generated by $\map \phi g$.


Case $1$: $\Img \phi$ is infinite
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $m \ne 0$.
Then $g^m$ is not the identity.

Thus:














\(\ds \map \phi {g^m}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\map \phi g}^m\)





Homomorphism of Power of Group Element














\(\ds \)

\(\ne\)







\(\ds e_H\)





Definition of Infinite Cyclic Group



However this contradicts $g^m \in \gen {g^m} = \map \ker \phi$.
Hence we must have $m = 0$.
$\Box$


Case $2$: $\Img \phi$ is finite
From Order of Cyclic Group equals Order of Generator, the order of $\map \phi g$ is $\order {\Img \phi}$.
Let $n \in \Z$.
By Division Theorem:

$\exists q, r \in \Z: 0 \le r < \order {\Img \phi}: n = q \order {\Img \phi} + r$
We have:














\(\ds \map \phi {g^n}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\map \phi g}^n\)





Homomorphism of Power of Group Element














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\map \phi g}^{q \order {\Img \phi} + r}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\paren {\map \phi g}^{\order {\Img \phi} } }^q \paren {\map \phi g}^r\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds {e_H}^q \paren {\map \phi g}^r\)





as $\paren {\map \phi g}^{\order {\Img \phi} } = e_H$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\map \phi g}^r\)





Power of Identity is Identity



From definition of order of group element:

$0 < r < \order {\Img \phi} \implies \paren {\map \phi g}^r \ne e_H$
Hence:














\(\ds \map \phi {g^n} = e_H\)

\(\iff\)







\(\ds r = 0\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds g^n \in \ker \phi\)

\(\iff\)







\(\ds n = q \order {\Img \phi}\)





Definition of Kernel of Group Homomorphism








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds g^n \in \gen {g^m}\)

\(\iff\)







\(\ds g^n \in \gen {g^\order {\Img \phi} }\)





Group Generated by Singleton








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds \gen {g^m}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \gen {g^\order {\Img \phi} }\)





Definition of Set Equality



and we see that $m = \order {\Img \phi}$ satisfies the above relation.

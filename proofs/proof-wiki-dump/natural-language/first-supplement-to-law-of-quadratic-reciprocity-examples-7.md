Examples of First Supplement to Law of Quadratic Reciprocity
$-1$ is a quadratic non-residue of $7$.


Proof
From Quadratic Residues of 7:

the set of quadratic residues modulo $7$ is:
$\set {1, 2, 4}$
but not $6 \equiv -1 \pmod 7$.

We also have that:

$7 = 4 \times 2 - 1$
and so is not of the form $4 n + 1$.
$\blacksquare$

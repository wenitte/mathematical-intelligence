Theorem
$2016$ has the property that its ratio to its aliquot sum is $4 : 9$.


Proof
The aliquot sum of an integer $n$ is the integer sum  of the aliquot parts of $n$.
That is, the aliquot sum of $2016$ is the divisor sum of $2016$ minus $2016$.
Thus:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {2016} - 2016\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6552 - 2016\)





$\sigma_1$ of $2016$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4536\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4 \times \paren {\map {\sigma_1} {2016} - 2016}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 18 \, 144\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 \times 2016\)









$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
Leonard Eugene Dickson reports in his $1919$ work History of the Theory of Numbers, Volume I that this result was noted by Pierre de Fermat, in response to Marin Mersenne's 
observation that $360$ has the same property.

Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a ring with unity whose zero is $0_R$ and whose unity is $1_R$.
Let the characteristic of $R$ be $p$.
For any $a \in R$, we define the mapping $g_a: \Z \to R$ from the integers into $R$ as:

$\forall n \in \Z: \map {g_a} n = n \cdot a$

Then:

$\ideal p \subseteq \map \ker {g_a}$
where:

$\map \ker {g_a}$ is the kernel of $g_a$
$\ideal p$ is the principal ideal of $\Z$ generated by $p$.


Proof
We have from Multiple Function on Ring is Homomorphism that $g_a$ is a group homomorphism.
By definition of kernel:

$x \in \map \ker {g_a} \iff \map {g_a} x = 0_R$
Hence to show that $\ideal p \subseteq \map \ker {g_a}$, we need to show that:

$\forall x \in \ideal p: \map {g_a} x = 0_R$

By definition of characteristic, $p \in \Z_{\ge 0}$ is such that $\ideal p$ is the kernel of $g_1$:

$\map {g_1} n = n \cdot 1_R$
So:














\(\ds x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \ideal p\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {g_1} x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0_R\)





Definition 2 of Characteristic of Ring: $\ideal p$ is the kernel of $g_1$




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x \cdot 1_R\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0_R\)





Definition of $g_a$ where here $a = 1$




Then:














\(\ds \map {g_a} x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x \cdot a\)





Definition of $g_a$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds x \cdot \paren {a \circ 1_R}\)





Definition of Multiplicative Identity














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \circ \paren {x \cdot 1_R}\)





Multiple of Ring Product














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \circ 0_R\)





from $(1)$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0_R\)





Definition of Ring Zero




So:

$x \in \map \ker {g_a}$
and so: 

$\ideal p \subseteq \map \ker {g_a}$
$\blacksquare$

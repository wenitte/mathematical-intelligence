Theorem
Let $S$ and $T$ be sets.
Let $f: S \to T$ be a bijection.
Let $H \subseteq S$.
Let $f \sqbrk H = K$ be the image of $H$ under $f$.
Let $\relcomp S H$ denote the relative complement of $H$ in $S$.

Then:

$f \sqbrk {\relcomp S H} = \relcomp T K$


Proof
From Set with Relative Complement forms Partition, $\set {H \mid \relcomp S H}$ forms a partition of $S$.
The result follows from Bijection Preserves Set Partition.
$\blacksquare$

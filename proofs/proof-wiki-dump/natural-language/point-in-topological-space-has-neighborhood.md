Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $x \in S$.

Then there exists in $T$ at least one neighborhood of $x$.

That is:

$\forall x \in S: \NN_x \ne \O$
where $\NN_x$ is the neighborhood filter of $x$.


Proof
Let $x \in S$.
Then $S$ itself is a neighborhood of $x$.
$\blacksquare$

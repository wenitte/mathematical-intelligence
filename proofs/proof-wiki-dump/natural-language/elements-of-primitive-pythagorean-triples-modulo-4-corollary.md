Corollary to Elements of Primitive Pythagorean Triples Modulo 4
In every Pythagorean triple, at least one element is a multiple of $4$.


Proof
From Solutions of Pythagorean Equation, any Pythagorean triple is such that all elements are a multiple of the elements in some primitive Pythagorean triple.
As the latter must have an even element which is a multiple of $4$, such an element when multiplied by some integer will still be a multiple of $4$.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Diophantine Problem
To find $3$ numbers such that, if each give to the next following a given fraction of itself, in order, the results after each has given and taken may be equal.

Let:

the first give $\dfrac 1 3$ of itself to the second
the second give $\dfrac 1 4$ of itself to the third
the third give $\dfrac 1 5$ of itself to the first.
What are the numbers?


Solution
The solution given by Diophantus of Alexandria is:

$\set {6, 4, 5}$
but it is only the ratio which is important, so:

$\set {12, 8, 10}$
is another solution.


Proof
Let $m$ be the final number.
Let $x = 3 p$.
$y$ is assumed to be divisible by $4$.
Let $y = 4$ be chosen.
Thus after giving and taking to and from $y$, we have:














\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {4 - 1} + p\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds p + 3\)









Thus $x$ must also become $p + 3$.
This $x$ must have taken $p + 3 - 2 p$, that is, $3 - p$.
Thus $3 - p$ must also be $\dfrac z 5$.
That is:

$z = 15 - 5 p$
Thus:














\(\ds 15 - 5 p - \paren {3 - p} + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds p + 3\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 13 - 4 p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds p + 3\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)









Hence the solution:














\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)




















\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4\)




















\(\ds z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)

Theorem
Let $T$ = $\struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $F$ be a closed set of $T$.
Let $H \subseteq F$ be a subset of $F$.
Let $H^-$ denote the closure of $H$.

Then $H^- \subseteq F$.


Proof













\(\ds H\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds F\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds H^-\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds F^-\)





Topological Closure of Subset is Subset of Topological Closure














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds F\)





Set is Closed iff Equals Topological Closure



$\blacksquare$

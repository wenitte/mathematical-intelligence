Theorem
$\quad \paren {\dfrac {-1} p} = \paren {-1}^{\paren {p - 1} / 2} = \begin {cases}
+1 & : p \equiv 1 \pmod 4 \\
-1 & : p \equiv 3 \pmod 4
\end {cases}$
where $\paren {\dfrac {-1} p}$ is defined as the Legendre symbol.


Proof
From Euler's Criterion for Quadratic Residue, and the definition of the Legendre symbol, we have that:

$\paren {\dfrac a p} \equiv a^{\paren {p - 1} / 2} \pmod p$
The result follows by putting $a = -1$.

Theorem
Let $a, b \in \Z$ be integers.
Let $a$ be odd.
Let:

$a \perp b$
where $\perp$ denotes coprimality.

Then:

$a \perp 2 b$

In the words of Euclid:

If an odd number be prime to any number, it will also be prime to the double of it.
(The Elements: Book $\text{IX}$: Proposition $31$)


Proof
By definition of odd number:

$a \perp 2$
The result follows from Integer Coprime to Factors is Coprime to Whole.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $31$ of Book $\text{IX}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Theorem
Let $f,g : \R \to \R$ be computable real functions.
Let $h : \R \to \R$ be defined as:

$\map h x = \map f {\map g x}$

Then $h$ is computable.


Proof
Follows immediately from:

Composition of Sequentially Computable Real Functions is Sequentially Computable
Composition of Computably Uniformly Continuous Real Functions is Computably Uniformly Continuous
$\blacksquare$

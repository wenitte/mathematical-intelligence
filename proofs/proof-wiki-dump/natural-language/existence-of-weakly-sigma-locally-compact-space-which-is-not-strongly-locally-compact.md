Theorem
There exists at least one example of a weakly $\sigma$-locally compact topological space which is not also a strongly locally compact space.


Proof
Let $T$ be the nested interval topological space.

From Nested Interval Topology is Weakly $\sigma$-Locally Compact, $T$ is a weakly $\sigma$-locally compact space.
From Nested Interval Topology is not Strongly Locally Compact, $T$ is not a strongly locally compact space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

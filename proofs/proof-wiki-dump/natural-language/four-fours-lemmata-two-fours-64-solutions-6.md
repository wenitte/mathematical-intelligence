Puzzle: Two Fours: $64$
Using exactly $2$ instances of the number $4$, the task is to write an expression for $64$, using whatever arithmetical operations you consider necessary.


Solution
$64 = 4^{\sqrt {\map {\pi} {4!} } }$

where $\map \pi \cdot$ represents the prime-counting function.


Proof
The primes less than $4! = 24$ are:

$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$
so $\map {\pi} {4!} = 9$.
Thus:

$4^{\sqrt {\map {\pi} {4!} } } = 4^{\sqrt 9} = 64$
$\blacksquare$

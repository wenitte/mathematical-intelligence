Example of Use of Product Rule for Counting
Let it be understood that a football match between two teams $\text A$ and $\text B$ can end as:

A win for team $\text A$
A draw
A loss for team $\text A$.
That being understood, then there are $729$ ways to predict the results of $6$ football matches.


Proof
Each match as the above described $3$ possible outcomes.
Hence by the Product Rule for Counting, there are $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 3^6 = 729$ possible ways of forecasting the result of $6$ such matches.
$\blacksquare$

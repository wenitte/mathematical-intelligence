Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preccurlyeq_S}$ and $\struct {T, \preccurlyeq_T}$ be ordered sets such that $S \subseteq T$.
Let ${\preccurlyeq_S} = {\preccurlyeq_T} {\restriction_S}$ be the restriction of $\preccurlyeq_T$ to $S$.
Let $i_S: S \to T$ denote the inclusion mapping from $S$ to $T$:

$\forall s \in S: \map {i_S} s = s$

Then $i_S$ is an order embedding.


Proof
We have that Inclusion Mapping is Restriction of Identity.
Then we have that Identity Mapping is Order Isomorphism.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

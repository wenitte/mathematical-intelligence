Example of Domain of Variable
Let $S$ be the total number of points that are obtained when tossing a pair of dice.
The domain of $S$ is the set $\set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}$.
$S$ is a discrete variable.


Proof
The set of points that can be obtained on a single die is $\set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$.
Hence the set of points that can be obtained on a pair of die is found by adding each of the elements of $\set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$ with each of the elements of the same set.
$\blacksquare$

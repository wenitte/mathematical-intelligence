Theorem
The external angle of a triangle is greater than either of the opposite internal angles.

In the words of Euclid:

In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the The exterior angle is greater than either interior and opposite angles.
(The Elements: Book $\text{I}$: Proposition $16$)


Proof

Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
Let the side $BC$ be extended to $D$.
Let $AC$ be bisected at $E$.
Let $BE$ be joined and extended to $F$.
Let $EF$ be made equal to $BE$.
(Technically we really need to extend $BE$ to a point beyond $F$ and then crimp off a length $EF$.)
Let $CF$ be joined.
Let $AC$ be extended to $G$.

We have $\angle AEB = \angle CEF$ from Two Straight Lines make Equal Opposite Angles.
Since $AE = EC$ and $BE = EF$, from Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence we have $\triangle ABE = \triangle CFE$.
Thus $AB = CF$ and $\angle BAE = \angle ECF$.
But $\angle ECD$ is greater than $\angle ECF$.
Therefore $\angle ACD$ is greater than $\angle BAE$.

Similarly, if $BC$ were bisected, $\angle BCG$, which is equal to $\angle ACD$ by Two Straight Lines make Equal Opposite Angles, would be shown to be greater than $\angle ABC$ as well.

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $16$ of Book $\text{I}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

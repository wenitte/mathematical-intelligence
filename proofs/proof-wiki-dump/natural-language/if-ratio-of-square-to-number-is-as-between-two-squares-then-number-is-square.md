Theorem
Let $a, b, c, d \in \Z$ be integers such that:

$\dfrac a b = \dfrac {c^2} {d^2}$
Let $a$ be a square number.
Then $b$ is also a square number.

In the words of Euclid:

If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, and the first be square, the second will also be square.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VIII}$: Proposition $24$)


Proof
From Proposition $18$ of Book $\text{VIII} $: Between two Similar Plane Numbers exists one Mean Proportional:

$\tuple {c^2, c d, d^2}$
is a geometric sequence.
From Proposition $8$ of Book $\text{VIII} $: Geometric Sequences in Proportion have Same Number of Elements:

$\tuple {a, m, b}$
is a geometric sequence for some $m$.
We have that $a$ is a square number.
From Proposition $22$ of Book $\text{VIII} $: If First of Three Numbers in Geometric Sequence is Square then Third is Square:

$b$ is a square number.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $24$ of Book $\text{VIII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

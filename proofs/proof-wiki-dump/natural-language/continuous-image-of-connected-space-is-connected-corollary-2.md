Corollary to Continuous Image of Connected Space is Connected
Let $T$ be a connected topological space.
Let $f: T \to \R$ be a continuous real-valued mapping.

Then $f \sqbrk T$ is a real interval.


Proof
From Continuous Image of Connected Space is Connected, the continuous image of the connected space $T$ is connected.
The result follows from Subset of Real Numbers is Interval iff Connected.
$\blacksquare$

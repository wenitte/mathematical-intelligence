Theorem
There exists at least one example of a semiregular topological space which is not a Urysohn space.


Proof
Let $T$ be an Arens square.

From Arens Square is Semiregular, $T$ is a semiregular space.
From Arens Square is not Urysohn Space, $T$ is not a Urysohn space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

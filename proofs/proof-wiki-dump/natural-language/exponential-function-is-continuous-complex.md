Theorem
The complex exponential function is continuous.
That is:

$\forall z_0 \in \C: \ds \lim_{z \mathop \to z_0} \exp z = \exp z_0$


Proof
This proof depends on the differential equation definition of the exponential function.
The result follows from Complex-Differentiable Function is Continuous.

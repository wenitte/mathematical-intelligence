Theorem
Let $x$ and $y$ in $\R$ be real numbers such that:

$x \le y$
Then:

$-y \le -x$
where $-y$ and $-x$ are the negatives of $y$ and $x$ respectively.


Proof
By definition of ordering:

$x \le y$
if and only if:

$x < y \text { or } x = y$
From Order of Real Numbers is Dual of Order of their Negatives:

$x < y \iff \paren {-x} > \paren {-y}$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

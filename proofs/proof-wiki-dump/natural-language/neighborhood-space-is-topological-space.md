Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \NN}$ be a neighborhood space.
Let $\tau = \set {N: N \in \NN}$ be the set of all open sets of $\struct {S, \NN}$.

Then $\struct {S, \tau}$ forms a topological space.


Proof
Each of the open set axioms is examined in turn:


Open Set Axiom $\paren {\text O 1 }$: Union of Open Sets
From Union of Open Sets of Neighborhood Space is Open, it follows that {{Open-set-axiom|1} is fulfilled.
$\Box$


Open Set Axiom $\paren {\text O 2 }$: Pairwise Intersection of Open Sets
From Intersection of two Open Sets of Neighborhood Space is Open, it follows that Open Set Axiom $\paren {\text O 2 }$: Pairwise Intersection of Open Sets is fulfilled.
$\Box$


Open Set Axiom $\paren {\text O 3 }$: Underlying Set is Element of Topology
From Whole Space is Open in Neighborhood Space, it follows that Open Set Axiom $\paren {\text O 3 }$: Underlying Set is Element of Topology is fulfilled.
$\Box$

All the open set axioms are fulfilled, and the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

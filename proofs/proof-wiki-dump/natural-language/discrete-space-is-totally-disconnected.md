Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space where $\tau$ is the discrete topology on $S$.

Then $T$ is totally disconnected.


Proof
Follows from:

Discrete Space is Extremally Disconnected
Extremally Disconnected Space is Totally Separated
Totally Separated Space is Totally Disconnected
$\blacksquare$

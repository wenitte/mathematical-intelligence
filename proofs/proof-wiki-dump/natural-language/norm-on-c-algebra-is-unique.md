Theorem
Let $\struct {A, \ast}$ be a $\ast$-algebra over $\C$. 
Let $\norm {\, \cdot \,}_1$ and $\norm {\, \cdot \,}_2$ be algebra norms on $\struct {A, \ast}$ such that:

$\struct {A, \ast, \norm {\, \cdot \,}_1}$ and $\struct {A, \ast, \norm {\, \cdot \,}_2}$ are $\text C^\ast$-algebras.

Then:

$\norm x_1 = \norm x_2$
for each $x \in A$. 


Proof
Note that the spectrum of $x \in A$ is defined independently of the algebra norm on $A$, depending only on the invertible elements of $A$.
With that:














\(\ds \norm x_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \norm {x x^\ast}_1\)





Definition of C*-Algebra














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {r_A} {x x^\ast}\)





Product of Element in *-Star Algebra with its Star is Hermitian, Spectral Radius of Normal Element of C*-Algebra Equal to Norm














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \norm {x x^\ast}_2\)





Product of Element in *-Star Algebra with its Star is Hermitian, Spectral Radius of Normal Element of C*-Algebra Equal to Norm














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \norm x_2\)

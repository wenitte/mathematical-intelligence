Theorem
$A = \struct {A_F, \oplus}$ be a nicely normed $*$-algebra which is also an alternative algebra.
Then $A$ is a normed division algebra.


Proof
Let $a, b \in A$.
Then all of $a, b, a^*, b^*$ can be generated by $\map \Im a$ and $\map \Im b$.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Prove the above statement.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
So as $A$ is an alternative algebra, it follows that $\oplus$ is associative for $a, b, a^*, b^*$.
So:














\(\ds \norm {a b}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a \oplus b} \oplus \paren {a \oplus b}^*\)





Definition of Norm in Nicely Normed $*$-Algebra














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \oplus b \oplus \paren {b^* \oplus a^*}\)





Definition of Conjugate














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \oplus \paren {b \oplus b^*} \oplus a^*\)





Associativity of $\oplus$ (from above)














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \norm a^2 \norm b^2\)

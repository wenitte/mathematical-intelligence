Theorem
Let $S$ be a countable set.
Let $\mathbb S = \powerset S \setminus \set \O$ be the power set of $S$ excluding the empty set $\O$.
Then there exists a  choice function $C$ for $S$:

$\forall x \in \mathbb S: \map C x \in x$


Proof
From Countable Set is Well-Orderable, we have that $S$ is a well-orderable set.
The result follows from Well-Orderable Set has Choice Function.
$\blacksquare$

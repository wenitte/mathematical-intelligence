Theorem
The following sequence of $9$ consecutive prime numbers are all of the form $4 n + 1$:

$11 \, 593, 11 \, 597, 11 \, 617, 11 \, 621, 11 \, 633, 11 \, 657, 11 \, 677, 11 \, 681, 11 \, 689$


Proof













\(\ds 11 \, 593\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 2898 + 1\)




















\(\ds 11 \, 597\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 2899 + 1\)




















\(\ds 11 \, 617\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 2904 + 1\)




















\(\ds 11 \, 621\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 2905 + 1\)




















\(\ds 11 \, 633\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 2908 + 1\)




















\(\ds 11 \, 657\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 2914 + 1\)




















\(\ds 11 \, 677\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 2919 + 1\)




















\(\ds 11 \, 681\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 2920 + 1\)




















\(\ds 11 \, 689\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 2922 + 1\)










It remains to be noted that:

the prime number before $11 \, 593$ is $11 \, 587$ which is $4 \times 2897 - 1$
the prime number after $11 \, 689$ is $11 \, 699$ which is $4 \times 2925 - 1$
confirming that they are not of the form $4 n + 1$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
In his Curious and Interesting Numbers of $1986$, David Wells reports that Richard K. Guy discusses this in his Unsolved Problems in Number Theory of $1981$.
In Curious and Interesting Numbers, 2nd ed. of $1997$, he then attributes this result to a certain Den Haan, but gives no context.
It remains to identify who this is.

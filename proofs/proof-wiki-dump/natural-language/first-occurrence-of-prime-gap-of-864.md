Theorem
The first occurrence of a prime gap of $864$ is between $6 \, 505 \, 941 \, 701 \, 960 \, 039$ and $6 \, 505 \, 941 \, 701 \, 960 \, 903$.


Proof
$6 \, 505 \, 941 \, 701 \, 960 \, 039$ is a prime number.
$6 \, 505 \, 941 \, 701 \, 960 \, 903$ is a prime number.
It can be checked that all numbers between these two are composite.
It can also be checked by computer that there is no prime gap of $864$ between smaller prime numbers.
$\blacksquare$

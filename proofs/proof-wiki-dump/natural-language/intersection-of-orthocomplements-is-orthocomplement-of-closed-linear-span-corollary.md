Corollary to Intersection of Orthocomplements is Orthocomplement of Closed Linear Span
Let $H$ be a Hilbert space.
Let $\family {M_i}_{i \mathop \in I}$ be an $I$-indexed family of closed linear subspaces of $H$.

Then:

$\ds \paren {\bigcap_{i \mathop \in I} M_i}^\perp = \vee \set {M_i^\perp : i \in I}$
where:

$\perp$ denotes orthocomplementation
$\vee$ denotes closed linear span.


Proof
From Orthocomplement is Closed Linear Subspace, the $M_i^\perp$ are an $I$-indexed family of closed linear subspaces of $H$.
From Intersection of Orthocomplements is Orthocomplement of Closed Linear Span:

$\ds \bigcap_{i \mathop \in I} \paren {M_i^\perp}^\perp = \paren {\vee \set {M_i^\perp : i \in I} }^\perp$
Taking the orthocomplement of both sides, and using Corollary to Double Orthocomplement is Closed Linear Span yields the result.
$\blacksquare$

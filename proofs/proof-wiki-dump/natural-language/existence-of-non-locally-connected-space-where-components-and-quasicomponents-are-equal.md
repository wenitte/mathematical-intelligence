Theorem
There exists at least one example of a topological space which is not locally connected, but whose components and quasicomponents are equal.


Proof
Let $T$ be the Arens-Fort space.

From Arens-Fort Space is not Locally Connected, $T$ is not a locally connected space.
The result follows from Components and Quasicomponents of Arens-Fort Space are Equal.
$\blacksquare$

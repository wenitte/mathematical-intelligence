Example of Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime
$\map {\sigma_1} {26} = 42$


Proof
We have that:

$26 = 2 \times 13$
and so by definition is a semiprime whose prime factors are distinct.

Hence:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {26}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2 + 1} \paren {13 + 1}\)





Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 14\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 42\)









$\blacksquare$

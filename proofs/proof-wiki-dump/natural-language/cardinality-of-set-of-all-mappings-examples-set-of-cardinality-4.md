Example of Cardinality of Set of All Mappings
Let $S$ be a set whose cardinality is $4$:

$\card S = 4$
Then there are $256$ mappings from $S$ to itself.


Proof
Let $T$ be the set of mappings from $S$ to itself.
From Cardinality of Set of All Mappings:

$\card T = \card S^\card S = 4^4 = 256$
The result follows by Examples of Factorials.
$\blacksquare$

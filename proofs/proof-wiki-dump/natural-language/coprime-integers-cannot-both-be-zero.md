Theorem
Let $a$ and $b$ be integers.
Let $a$ and $b$ be coprime.
Then it cannot be the case that $a = b = 0$.


Proof
Let $a$ and $b$ be coprime.
Then by definition:

$\gcd \set {a, b} = 1$
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $a = b = 0$.
Then $\gcd \set {a, b}$ is undefined.
But it is not possible both:

for $\gcd \set {a, b}$ to be undefined
for $\gcd \set {a, b} = 1$.

Hence by Proof by Contradiction it follows that it cannot be the case that $a = b = 0$.

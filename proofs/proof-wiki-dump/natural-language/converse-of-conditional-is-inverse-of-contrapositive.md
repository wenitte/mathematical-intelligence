Theorem
Let $p \implies q$ be a conditional.
Then the converse of $p \implies q$ is the inverse of its contrapositive.


Proof
The converse of $p \implies q$ is:

$q \implies p$
The contrapositive of $p \implies q$ is:

$\neg q \implies \neg p$
The inverse of $\neg q \implies \neg p$ is:

$\neg \neg q \implies \neg \neg p$
By Double Negation, the two are seen to be equal.
$\blacksquare$

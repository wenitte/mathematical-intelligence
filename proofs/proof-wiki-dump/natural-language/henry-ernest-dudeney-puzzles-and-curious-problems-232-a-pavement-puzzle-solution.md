Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $232$
A Pavement Puzzle
Two square floors had to be paved with stones each $1$ foot square.
The number of stones in both together was $2120$, but each side of one floor was $12$ feet more than each side of the other floor.
What were the dimensions of the two floors?


Solution
$26$ and $38$ feet on one side.


Proof
Let $a$ and $b$ feet be the lengths of the sides of the floors.
We have:














\(\ds a^2 + b^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2120\)





The number of stones in both together was $2120$,














\(\ds b = a + 12\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2120\)





but each side of one floor was $12$ feet more than each side of the other floor.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^2 + \paren {a + 12}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2120\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^2 + 12 a - 988\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





after simplification








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {-12 \pm \sqrt {12^2 + 4 \times 988} } 2\)





Quadratic Formula














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {-12 \pm \sqrt {4096} } 2\)





Quadratic Formula














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -6 \pm 32\)





after evaluation














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 26 \text { or } -38\)









As it is the positive root we want here, we have that $a = 26$ and hence $b = 26 + 12 = 38$.
$\blacksquare$

Corollary to Cartesian Product of Subsets
Let $A, B, C$ be sets such that $B \ne \O$.
Let $A \times B \subseteq C \times C$.

Then:

$A \subseteq C$


Proof
Since $B \ne O$ we have from Cartesian Product of Subsets that:

$A \times B \subseteq C \times C \implies A \subseteq C \land B \subseteq C$
$\blacksquare$

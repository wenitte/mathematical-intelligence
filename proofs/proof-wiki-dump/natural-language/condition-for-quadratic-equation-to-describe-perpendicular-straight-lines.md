Theorem
Let $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$ represent $2$ straight lines in the Cartesian plane which are represented by a quadratic equation $E$ in two variables:

$a x^2 + b y^2 + 2 h x y + 2 g x + 2 f y + c = 0$

Let $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$ be perpendicular.
Then:

$a + b = 0$

That is, $E$ is of the form:

$a \paren {x^2 - y^2} + 2 h x y + 2 g x + 2 f y + c = 0$


Proof
From Homogeneous Quadratic Equation for Straight Lines Parallel to those Passing through Origin, $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$ are parallel respectively to the $2$ straight lines through the origin $\LL'_1$ and $\LL'_2$ represented by the homogeneous quadratic equation:

$a x^2 + 2 h x y + b y^2$
As $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$ are parallel respectively to $\LL'_1$ and $\LL'_2$, it follows that $\LL'_1$ and $\LL'_2$ are themselves perpendicular.
Hence from Condition for Homogeneous Quadratic Equation to describe Perpendicular Straight Lines, $\LL'_1$ and $\LL'_2$ are represented by the homogeneous quadratic equation:

$a x^2 + 2 h x y - a y^2$
That is:

$a + b = 0$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

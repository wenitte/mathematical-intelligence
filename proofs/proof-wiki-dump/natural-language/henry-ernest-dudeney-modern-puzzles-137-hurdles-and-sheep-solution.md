Hurdles and Sheep
A farmer says that four of his hurdles will form a square enclosure just sufficient for one sheep.
That being so, what is the smallest number of hurdles that he will require for enclosing ten sheep?


Solution
$12$ hurdles.


Proof
From the problem definition, an area of $1$ hurdle length squared holds $1$ sheep.
Hence the problem is to find the largest area enclosed by a given number of hurdles.
This is that enclosed by a regular polygon.

Let $A_n$ be the area enclosed by a regular $n$-gon.
From Area of Regular Polygon:

$A_n = \dfrac n 4 \cot \dfrac \pi n$
Hence:














\(\ds A_{11}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {11} 4 \cot \dfrac \pi {11}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\approx\)







\(\ds 9.37\)




















\(\ds A_{12}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12} 4 \cot \dfrac \pi {12}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\approx\)







\(\ds 11.2\)









Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

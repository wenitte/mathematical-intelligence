Theorem
Let $K$ be an ellipse whose foci are $F_1$ and $F_2$.
Let $P$ be an arbitrary point on $K$.

Let $d$ be the constant distance such that:

$d_1 + d_2 = d$
where:

$d_1 = P F_1$
$d_2 = P F_2$

Then $d$ is equal to the major axis of $K$.


Proof

By the equidistance property of $K$:

$d_1 + d_2 = d$
applies to all points $P$ on $K$.

Thus it also applies to the two vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$:

$V_1 F_1 + V_1 F_2 = d$
$V_2 F_1 + V_2 F_2 = d$
Adding:

$V_1 F_1 + V_2 F_1 + V_1 F_2 + V_2 F_2 = 2 d$
But:

$V_1 F_1 + V_2 F_1 = V_1 V_2$
$V_1 F_2 + V_2 F_2 = V_1 V_2$
and so:

$2 V_1 V_2 = 2 d$
By definition, the major axis is $V_1 V_2$.
Hence the result.

Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Exterior in the context of Topology are equivalent:

Let $T$ be a topological space.
Let $H \subseteq T$.

Definition 1
The exterior of $H$ is the complement of the closure of $H$ in $T$.

Definition 2
The exterior of $H$ is the interior of the complement of $H$ in $T$.


Proof
Let $H^e$ be defined as:

$H^e$ is the complement of the closure of $H$ in $T$.

Then:














\(\ds H^e\)

\(=\)







\(\ds T \setminus H^-\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {T \setminus H}^\circ\)





Complement of Interior equals Closure of Complement



Thus:

$H^e$ is the interior of the complement of $H$ in $T$.
$\blacksquare$

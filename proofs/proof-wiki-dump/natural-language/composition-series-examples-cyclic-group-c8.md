Example of Composition Series
There is $1$ composition series of the cyclic group $C_8$, up to isomorphism:

$\set e \lhd C_2 \lhd C_4 \lhd C_8$


Proof
From Cyclic Group is Abelian and Subgroup of Abelian Group is Normal, all subgroups of $C_n$ are normal in $C_n$.
This leads directly to the composition series:

$\set e \lhd C_2 \lhd C_4 \lhd C_8$
$\blacksquare$

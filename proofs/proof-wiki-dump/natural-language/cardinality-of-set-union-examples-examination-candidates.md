Example of Use of Cardinality of Set Union
In a particular examination, there were $3$ questions.
All candidates attempted at least one of the questions.

$40$ candidates attempted question $1$.
$47$ candidates attempted question $2$.
$31$ candidates attempted question $3$.
Also, it was apparent that:

$9$ candidates attempted at least questions $1$ and $2$.
$15$ candidates attempted at least questions $1$ and $3$.
$11$ candidates attempted at least questions $2$ and $3$.
and:

exactly $6$ candidates attempted all $3$ questions.

It follows that $89$ candidates sat the examination in total.


Proof
Let:

$S_1$ denote the set of candidates who attempted question $1$.
$S_2$ denote the set of candidates who attempted question $2$.
$S_3$ denote the set of candidates who attempted question $3$.
The number of candidates $N$ who sat the examination in total is therefore:

$N = S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3$

From Cardinality of Set Union: 3 Sets:














\(\ds \card {S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \card {S_1} + \card {S_2} + \card {S_3}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds - \, \)

\(\ds \card {S_1 \cap S_2} - \card {S_1 \cap S_3} - \card {S_2 \cap S_3}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds + \, \)

\(\ds \card {S_1 \cap S_2 \cap S_3}\)










From the question:














\(\ds \card {S_1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40\)




















\(\ds \card {S_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 47\)




















\(\ds \card {S_3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 31\)




















\(\ds \card {S_1 \cap S_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9\)




















\(\ds \card {S_1 \cap S_3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 15\)




















\(\ds \card {S_2 \cap S_3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 11\)




















\(\ds \card {S_1 \cap S_2 \cap S_3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)










Hence:














\(\ds \card {S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40 + 47 + 31\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds - \, \)

\(\ds 9 - 15 - 11\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds + \, \)

\(\ds 6\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 89\)

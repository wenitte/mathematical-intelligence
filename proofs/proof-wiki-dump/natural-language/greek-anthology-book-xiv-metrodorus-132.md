Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
This is Polyphemus the brazen Cyclops, and as if on him someone made an eye, a mouth, and a hand, connecting them with pipes.
He looks quite as if he were dripping water and seems also to be spouting it from his mouth.
None of the spouts are irregular;
that from his hand when running will fill the cistern in three days only,
that from his eye in one day,
and his mouth in two-fifths of a day.
Who will tell me the time it takes when all three are running?


Solution
Let $t$ be the number of hours it takes to fill the cistern.
Let $a, b, c$ be the flow rate in numbers of cisterns per hour of (respectively) the eye, the mouth and the hand.

In $t$ hours, the various contributions of each of the spouts is $a t$, $b t$ and $c t$ respectively.
So for the total contribution to be $1$ cistern, we have:















\(\ds \paren {a + b + c} t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {a + b + c}\)










We have:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)





that is, $1$ cistern in $1$ day














\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 5 2\)





that is, $1$ cistern in $\dfrac 2 5$ of a day














\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 3\)





that is, $1$ cistern in $3$ days




and so:














\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {a + b + c}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {1 + \dfrac 5 2 + \dfrac 1 3}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 6 {6 + 15 + 2}\)





multiplying top and bottom by $6$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 6 {23}\)









So the cistern will be filled in $\dfrac 6 {23}$ of a day.
$\blacksquare$

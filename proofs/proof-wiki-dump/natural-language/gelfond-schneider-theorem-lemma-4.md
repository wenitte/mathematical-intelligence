Lemma
Let:

$\Delta = \det \sqbrk {\alpha_{i, j} }_{L \times L}$
where the $\alpha_{i, j}$ are algebraic numbers.
Suppose that $T$ is a positive (rational) integer for which $T \alpha_{i, j}$ is an algebraic integer for every $i, j \in \set {1, 2, \ldots, L}$.
Also, suppose that $\Delta \ne 0$.

Then there is a conjugate of $\Delta$ with absolute value $\ge T^{âˆ’L}$.


Proof
Observe that $T^L \Delta$ is an algebraic integer so that one of its conjugates has absolute value $\ge 1$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

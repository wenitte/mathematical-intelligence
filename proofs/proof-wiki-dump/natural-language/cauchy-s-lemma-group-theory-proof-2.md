Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group of finite order whose identity is $e$.
Let $p$ be a prime number which divides the order of $G$.

Then $\struct {G, \circ}$ has an element of order $p$.


Proof
By the corollary to the First Sylow Theorem, $G$ has subgroups of order $p^r$ for all $r$ such that $p^r \divides \order G$.
Thus $G$ has at least one subgroup $H$ of order $p$.
As a Prime Group is Cyclic, $H$ is a cyclic group.
Thus by definition $H$ has an element of order $p$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

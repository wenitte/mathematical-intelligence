Theorem
Let $\R$ be the real number line considered as an Euclidean space.
Let $\hointr a b \subset \R$ be a half-open interval of $\R$.

Then $\hointr a b$ is not an open set of $\R$.

Similarly, the half-open interval $\hointl a b \subset \R$ is not an open set of $\R$.


Proof
Let $\epsilon \in \R_{>0}$.
Let $\map {B_\epsilon} a$ be the open $\epsilon$-ball of $a$.
We have that $a - \epsilon < a$ and so $\map {B_\epsilon} a = \openint {a - \epsilon} {a + \epsilon}$ does not lie entirely in $\hointr a b$.
Thus $\hointr a b$ is not a neighborhood $a$.
It follows that $\hointr a b$ is not an open set of $\R$.

the argument also shows, mutatis mutandis, that $\hointl a b \subset \R$ is not an open set of $\R$.
$\blacksquare$

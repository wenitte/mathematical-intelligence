Example of Use of Number of Significant Figures in Result of Multiplication
$8 \cdotp 416 \times 50 = 420 \cdotp 8$
on the assumption that $50$ is exact.


Proof
We have that:

the number of significant figures $d_m$ in $8 \cdotp 416$ is $4$
the number of significant figures $d_n$ in $50$ is unlimited

So from Number of Significant Figures in Result of Multiplication:

the number of significant figures in $8 \cdotp 416 \times 50$ can be no more than $\min \set {4, \infty}$, that is $4$.















\(\ds 8 \cdotp 416 \times 50\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 420 \cdotp 8\)





by calculation














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 420 \cdotp 8\)





to $4$ significant figures



$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $fÂ : \C \to \C$ be an entire function. 
Let the real part of $f$ be constant.
That is, there exists a positive real number $C$ such that: 

$\map \Re {\map f z} = C$
for all $z \in \C$, where $\map \Re {\map f z}$ denotes the real part of $\map f z$.

Then $f$ is constant.


Proof
Note that for each $z \in \C$, we have: 

$\size {\map \Re {\map f z} } = \size C < 2 \size C$
So:

the real part of $f$ is bounded.
From Entire Function with Bounded Real Part is Constant, we have: 

$f$ is constant.

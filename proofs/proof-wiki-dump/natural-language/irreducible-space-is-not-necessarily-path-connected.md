Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a topological space which is irreducible.

Then $T$ is not necessarily path-connected.


Proof
Let $T$ be a countable finite complement space.
From Finite Complement Space is Irreducible, $T$ is an irreducible space.
From Countable Finite Complement Space is not Path-Connected, $T$ is not path-connected.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

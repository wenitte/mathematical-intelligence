Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $69$
The Four Cyclists
The four circles represent cinder paths.

The four cyclists started at noon.
Each person rode round a different circle,
one at the rate of $6$ miles an hour,
another at the rate of $9$ miles an hour,
another at the rate of $12$ miles an hour,
and the fourth at the rate of $15$ miles an hour.
They agreed to ride until all met at the centre, from which they started, for the fourth time.
The distances around each circle was exactly one-third of a mile.
When did they finish their ride?


Solution
$26$ minutes and $40$ seconds past noon.


Proof
Let $t$ be the time in hours at which they all arrive together.
The times taken to complete one circuit are respectively:

$\dfrac 1 3 \div 6 = \dfrac 1 {18}$ hours
$\dfrac 1 3 \div 9 = \dfrac 1 {27}$ hours
$\dfrac 1 3 \div 12 = \dfrac 1 {36}$ hours
$\dfrac 1 3 \div 15 = \dfrac 1 {45}$ hours
We have that $\lcm {18, 27, 36, 45} = 540$
Hence let us clear the fractions by letting time $h$ be the time period that is $h = 1 {540}$ of an hour.
Let $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$ and $t_4$ be the times taken by each cyclist in units of $h$.
We have:

$t_1 = 30$
$t_2 = 20$
$t_3 = 15$
$t_4 = 12$
Now we have that:

$\lcm {30, 20, 15, 12} = 60$
which is the smallest number of time units $h$ at which they are all at the middle together.
Thus:

$t = \dfrac {60} {540} = \dfrac 1 9$
or $6 \tfrac 2 3$ minutes.
Four times this is $26 \tfrac 2 3$ minutes, or $26$ minutes and $40$ seconds.
$\blacksquare$

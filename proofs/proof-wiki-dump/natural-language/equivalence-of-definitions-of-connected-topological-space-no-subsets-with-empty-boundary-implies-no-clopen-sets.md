Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $T$ be such that the only subsets of $S$ whose boundary is empty are $S$ and $\O$.

Then the only clopen sets of $T$ are $S$ and $\O$.


Proof
Let $H \subseteq S$ be a clopen set of $T$.
From Set is Clopen iff Boundary is Empty, $H$ has an empty boundary.
We have by hypothesis that $H = S$ or $H = \O$.
That is, the only clopen sets of $T$ are $S$ and $\O$.
$\blacksquare$

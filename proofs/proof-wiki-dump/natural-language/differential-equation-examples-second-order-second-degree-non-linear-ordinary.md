Example of Differential Equation
Ordinary non-linear differential equation of the $2$nd order and $2$nd degree:

$\paren {1 + \paren {\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} }^2}^{3/2} = 3 \dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2}$


Proof
Squaring both sides gives:

$\paren {1 + \paren {\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} }^2}^3 = 9 \paren {\dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2} }^2$
It is seen that the term in $\dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2}$ is squared.
Hence the result by definition of degree.
$\blacksquare$

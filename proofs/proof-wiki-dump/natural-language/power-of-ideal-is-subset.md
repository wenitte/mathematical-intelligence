Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \cdot}$ be a ring.
Let $I \subseteq R$ be an ideal.
Let $n \in \Z$ be an integer such that $n \ge 1$.
Let $I^n$ denote the $n$th power of $I$.

Then $I^n$ is a subset of $I$:

$I^n \subseteq I$


Proof
Let $n = 1$.
Then by definition of Power of Ideal of Ring:

$I^1 = I$
Hence by Set is Subset of Itself:

$I^1 \subseteq I$.
$\Box$

Let $n > 1$.
By definition of Power of Ideal of Ring, $I^n$ is an ideal generated by elements of $R$ the form:

$a_1 \cdots a_n$
where each $a_i \in I$.
From Ideal is Subring, $I$ is a subring of $R$.
Hence a fortiori $I$ is closed under addition.
Hence it suffices to show that such generators of $I^n$ are elements of $I$.

Let $a_1 \cdots a_n \in I^n$ such that each $a_i \in I$.
Then:

$a_1 \in I$
$a_2 \cdots a_n \in I$
Hence in particular:

$a_2 \cdots a_n \in R$
Because:

$a_1 \in I$
$a_2 \cdots a_n \in R$
it follows that:

$a_1 \cdot \paren {a_2 \cdots a_n} \in I$
Thus:

$a_1 \cdots a_n \in I$
and it follows by definition of subset that:

$I^n \subseteq I$
$\blacksquare$

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $150$
Sheep Sharing
An Australian farmer dies and leaves his sheep to his three sons.
Alfred is to get $20$ per cent more than John,
and $25$ per cent more than Charles.
John's share is $3600$ sheep.
How many sheep does Charles get?


Solution
Charles gets $3456$ sheep.


Proof
Let $A$, $J$ and $C$ be the number of sheep each of Alfred, John and Charles got respectively.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds J + \dfrac {20 J} {100} = \dfrac {6 J} 5\)





Alfred is to get $20$ per cent more than John,




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds C + \dfrac {25 J} {100} = \dfrac {5 C} 4\)





and $25$ per cent more than Charles.




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3600\)





John's share is $3600$ sheep.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {6 \times 3600} 5\)





substituting from $(3)$ into $(1)$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4320\)





substituting from $(3)$ into $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4320\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {5 \times C} 4\)





substituting into $(2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3456\)





simplifying



$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $N\leq G$ be normal.
Let $H\leq N$ be characteristic.

Then $H$ is normal in $G$.


Proof
Let $g \in G$.
Because $N$ is normal, conjugation by $g$ is an automorphism of $N$.
Because $H$ is characteristic in $N$, $g H g^{-1} = H$.
Thus $H$ is normal in $G$.
$\blacksquare$

Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $63$
Find the Factors
Find $2$ whole numbers with the smallest possible difference between them
which, when multiplied together, will produce $1234567890$.


Solution
$36070 \times 34227$


Proof
We have:

$1234567890 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 3607 \times 3803$
It is safe to say that one of the factors will contain $3607$ and the other $3803$.
It remains a matter of putting these together with the smaller ones to get the smallest difference.
The remaining factors can be collected as $3^2 = 9$ and $2 \times 5 = 10$














\(\ds 1234567890\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {9 \times 3803} \times \paren {10 \times 3607}\)









and so to the result.
$\blacksquare$

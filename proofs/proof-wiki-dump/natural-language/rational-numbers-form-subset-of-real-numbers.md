Theorem
The set $\Q$ of rational numbers forms a subset of the real numbers $\R$.


Proof
Let $x \in \Q$, where $\Q$ denotes the set of rational numbers.
Consider the rational sequence:

$x, x, x, \ldots$
This sequence is trivially Cauchy.

Thus there exists a Cauchy sequence $\eqclass {\sequence {x_n} } {}$ which is identified with a rational number $x \in \Q$ such that:

So by the definition of a real number:

$x \in \R$
where $\R$ denotes the set of real numbers.
Thus, by definition of subset:

$\Q \subseteq \R$
$\blacksquare$

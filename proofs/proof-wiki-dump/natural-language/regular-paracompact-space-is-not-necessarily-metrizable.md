Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is regular and paracompact.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $T$ is metrizable.


Proof 1
Let $T$ be the Sorgenfrey line.
From Sorgenfrey Line satisfies all Separation Axioms, $T$ is a regular space.
From Sorgenfrey Line is Paracompact, $T$ is a paracompact space.
From Sorgenfrey Line is not Metrizable, $T$ is not a metrizable space.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Let $T$ be the radial interval topology.
From Radial Interval Topology is Completely Normal, $T$ is a completely normal space.
Hence from Sequence of Implications of Separation Axioms, $T$ is a regular space.
From Radial Interval Topology is Paracompact, $T$ is a paracompact space.
From Radial Interval Topology is not Metrizable, $T$ is not a metrizable space.
$\blacksquare$

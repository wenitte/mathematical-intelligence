Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a partition space.
Then $T$ is zero dimensional.


Proof
Let $\PP$ be the partition which is the basis for $T$.
From Open Set in Partition Topology is also Closed, all the elements of $\PP$ are both closed and open.
Hence the result, by definition of zero dimensional space
$\blacksquare$

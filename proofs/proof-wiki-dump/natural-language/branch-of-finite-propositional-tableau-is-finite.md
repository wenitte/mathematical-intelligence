Theorem
Let $T$ be a finite propositional tableau.
Let $\Gamma$ be a branch of $T$.

Then $\Gamma$ is a finite branch.


Proof
By definition, a finite propositional tableau $T$ is formed by applying the tableau extension rules a finite number of times.
Each tableau extension rule extends $T$ finitely.
Therefore $T$ is a finite tree.
The result follows from Branch of Finite Tree is Finite.

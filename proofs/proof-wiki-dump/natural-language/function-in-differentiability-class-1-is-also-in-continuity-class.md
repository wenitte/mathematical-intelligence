Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function. 
Let $f$ be an element of differentiability class $C^1$.
Then $f$ is also an element of the class $C$ of continuous real functions.


Proof
By definition of $C^1$, $f \in C^1$ if and only if $f$ is differentiable.
By definition of $C$, $f \in C$ if and only if $f$ is continuous.
The result follows from Differentiable Function is Continuous.

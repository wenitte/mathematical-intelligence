Example of Quadratic Residues
There exists exactly $1$ quadratic residue modulo $3$, and that is $1$.


Proof
To list the quadratic residues of $3$ it is enough to work out the squares $1^2$ and $2^2$ modulo $3$.














\(\ds 1^2\)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 1\)

\(\ds \pmod 3\)


















\(\ds 2^2\)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 1\)

\(\ds \pmod 3\)








So the set of quadratic residues modulo $3$ is:

$\set 1$
The set of quadratic non-residues of $3$ therefore consists of all the other non-zero least positive residues:

$\set 2$
$\blacksquare$

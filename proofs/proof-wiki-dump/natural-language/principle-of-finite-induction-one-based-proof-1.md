Theorem
Let $S \subseteq \N_{>0}$ be a subset of the $1$-based natural numbers.

Suppose that:

$(1): \quad 1 \in S$
$(2): \quad \forall n \in \N_{>0} : n \in S \implies n + 1 \in S$

Then:

$S = \N_{>0}$


Proof
Consider $\N$ defined as a naturally ordered semigroup.
The result follows directly from Principle of Mathematical Induction for Naturally Ordered Semigroup: General Result.

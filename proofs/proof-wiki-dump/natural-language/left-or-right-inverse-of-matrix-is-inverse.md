Theorem
Let $\mathbf A, \mathbf B$ be square matrices of order $n$ over a commutative ring with unity $\left({R, +, \circ}\right)$.
Suppose that:

$\mathbf A \mathbf B = \mathbf I_n$
where $\mathbf I_n$ is the unit matrix of order $n$.

Then $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ are nonsingular matrices, and furthermore:

$\mathbf B = \mathbf A^{-1}$
where $\mathbf A^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\mathbf A$.


Proof
When $1_R$ denotes the unity of $R$, we have:














\(\ds 1_R\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \det {\mathbf I_n}\)





Determinant of Unit Matrix














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \det {\mathbf A \mathbf B}\)





by assumption














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \det {\mathbf A} \map \det {\mathbf B}\)





Determinant of Matrix Product




From Matrix is Nonsingular iff Determinant has Multiplicative Inverse, it follows that $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ are nonsingular.
Then:














\(\ds \mathbf B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \mathbf I_n \mathbf B\)





Unit Matrix is Unity of Ring of Square Matrices














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\mathbf A^{-1} \mathbf A} \mathbf B\)





Definition of Inverse Matrix














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \mathbf A^{-1} \paren {\mathbf A \mathbf B}\)





Matrix Multiplication is Associative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \mathbf A^{-1} \mathbf I_n\)





by assumption














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \mathbf A^{-1}\)

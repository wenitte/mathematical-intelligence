Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $225$
An Artist's Puzzle
An artist wished to obtain a canvas for a painting which would allow for
the picture itself occupying $72$ square inches,
a margin of $4$ inches on top and on bottom,
and $2$ inches on each side.
What is the smallest dimensions possible for such a canvas?


Solution
$10$ inches wide by $20$ inches high.
The picture will then be $6$ inches by $12$ inches.


Proof
Let $a$ inches be the width of the picture.
Let $A$ square inches be the total area of the canvas, including the picture and the borders.
We need to find $a$ such that $A$ is a minimum.
As the width is $a$, the height is $\dfrac {72} a$.
Hence:














\(\ds A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a + 4} \paren {\dfrac {72} a + 8}\)





a margin of $4$ inches on top and on bottom, and $2$ inches on each side.














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a + 4} \paren {\dfrac {72} a + 8}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 72 + \dfrac {288} a + 8 a + 32\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8 a + \dfrac {288} a + 104\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {\d A} {\d a}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8 - \dfrac {288} {a^2}\)









To make $A$ a minimum, we must make its derivative with respect to $a$ equal to zero.
Hence:














\(\ds 8 - \dfrac {288} {a^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 36\)





simplification



which leads us to the answer that the canvas must be $6 + 4 = 10$ inches wide and $\dfrac {72} 6 + 8 = 20$ inches high.
$\blacksquare$

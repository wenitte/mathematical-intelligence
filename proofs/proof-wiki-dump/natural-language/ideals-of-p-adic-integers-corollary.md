Theorem
Let $\Z_p$ be the $p$-adic integers for some prime $p$.

Then:

$\Z_p$ is a principal ideal domain
Proof
From Ideals of P-adic Integers, all ideals of $\Z_p$ are the principal ideals:

$\quad\set 0$
$\quad\forall n \in \N : p^n \Z_p$
Hence $\Z_p$ is a principal ideal domain by definition.

$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$ be the $p$-adic norm on the rationals $\Q$ for $p = 2$ or $3$.
 
Then:

$\struct {\Q, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ is not a complete normed division ring.

That is, there exists a Cauchy sequence in $\struct {\Q, \norm{\,\cdot\,}_p}$ which does not converge to a limit in $\Q$.

Proof

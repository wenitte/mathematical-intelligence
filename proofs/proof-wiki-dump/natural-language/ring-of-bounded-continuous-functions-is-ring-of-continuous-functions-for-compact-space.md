Theorem
Let $\struct {K, \tau}$ be a compact space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $\struct {\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ be the ring of continuous real-valued functions from $S$.
Let $\struct {\map {C^*} {S, \R}, +, *}$ be the ring of bounded continuous real-valued functions from $S$.

Then:

$\struct {\map {C^*} {S, \R}, +, *} = \struct {\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$


Proof
Follows immediately from:

Compact Space is Pseudocompact
Ring of Bounded Continuous Functions is Ring of Continuous Functions for Pseudocompact Space
$\blacksquare$

Example of Euler Lucky Number
The expression:

$n^2 + n + 41$
yields primes for $n = 0$ to $n = 39$.
It also generates the same set of primes for $n = -1 \to n = -40$.
These are not the only primes generated by this formula.

No other quadratic function of the form $x^2 + a x + b$, where $a, b \in \Z_{>0}$ and $a, b < 10000$ generates a longer sequence of primes.

which is not prime: $1681 = 41^2$



This sequence is A005846 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (N. J. A. Sloane (Ed.), 2008).

Then we have:














\(\ds \paren {-\paren  {n + 1} }^2 + \paren {-\paren {n + 1} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n^2 + 2 n + 1 - \paren {n + 1}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds n^2 + n\)









and so replacing $0$ to $39$ with $-1$ to $-40$ yields exactly the same sequence of primes.

We note in addition the example:

$581^2 + 581 + 41 = 338 \, 183$
which is prime.

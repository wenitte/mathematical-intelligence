Theorem
The set of integers under addition $\struct {\Z, +}$ forms a countably infinite abelian group.


Proof
From Integers under Addition form Abelian Group, $\struct {\Z, +}$ is an abelian group.
From Integers are Countably Infinite, the set of integers can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.
Hence by definition, the underlying set  of $\struct {\Z, +}$ is countably infinite.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function which is twice differentiable on the open interval $\openint a b$.
Let

$\map {f' '} \xi = 0$
where $\map {f' '} \xi$ denotes the second derivative of $f$ at $\xi \in \openint a b$.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $f$ has a point of inflection at $\xi$.


Proof
Consider the function:

$f: \R \to \R: \forall x \in \R: \map f x = x^4$
This has a local minimum at $x = 0$ at which $\map {f' '} x = 0$.
But $x = 0$ is not a point of inflection of $f$.
$\blacksquare$

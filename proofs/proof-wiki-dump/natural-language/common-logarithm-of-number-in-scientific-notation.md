Theorem
Let $n$ be a positive real number which is presented (possibly approximated) in scientific notation as:

$n = a \times 10^d$
where:

$1 \le a < 10$
$d \in \Z$ is an integer.
Then:

$\log_{10} n = \log_{10} a + d$
where:

$0 \le \log_{10} a < 1$


Proof













\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \times 10^d\)





by definition








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \log_{10} n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\log_{10} } {a \times 10^d}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \log_{10} a + \log_{10} 10^d\)





Logarithm of Product














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \log_{10} a + d\)





Definition of Common Logarithm



We are given that:

$1 \le a < 10$
It follows from Range of Common Logarithm of Number between 1 and 10 that:

$0 \le \log_{10} a < 1$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
In the words of Hypsicles of Alexandria:

(side of cube) : (side of icosahedron) = (content of dodecahedron) : (content of icosahedron)
(The Elements: Book $\text{XIV}$: Proposition $8$)


Lemma
In the words of Hypsicles of Alexandria:

If two straight lines be cut in extreme and mean ratio, the segments of both are in one and the same ratio.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XIV}$: Proposition $8$ : Lemma)


Proof
Let a regular dodecahedron, a regular icosahedron and a  cube be inscribed in a given sphere.
From Proposition $3$ of Book $\text{XIV} $: Circle Circumscribing Pentagon of Dodecahedron and Triangle of Icosahedron in Same Sphere:

the circle which circumscribes the regular pentagon which is the face of the regular dodecahedron is the same size as the circle which circumscribes the equilateral triangle which is the face of the regular icosahedron.
In a sphere, equal sections are equally distant from the center.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: The above statement needs a link to a proof.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Thus the perpendiculars from the center to the faces of the regular icosahedron and regular dodecahedron are equal.
So the pyramids whose apices are the center of the sphere and whose bases are the faces of these polyhedra are of the same height.
Therefore from Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{XII} $: Sizes of Pyramids of Same Height with Polygonal Bases are as Bases:

the ratios of these pyramids are to one another as their bases.
Thus:














\(\ds 12 \text { pentagons} : 20 \text { triangles}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12 \text { pyramids on pentagons} : 20 \text { pyramids on triangles}\)














\(\ds \therefore \ \ \)





\(\ds \text {surface of dodecahedron} : \text {surface of icosahedron}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \text {volume of dodecahedron} : \text{volume of icosahedron}\)










Therefore from Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{XIV} $: Ratio of Sizes of Surfaces of Cube and Regular Icosahedron in Same Sphere:














\(\ds \text {volume of dodecahedron} : \text{volume of icosahedron}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \text {side of cube} : \text {side of icosahedron}\)









$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $8$ of Book $\text{XIV}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Theorem
Let $M = \struct {S, \mathscr I}$ be a matroid.
Let $X \subseteq S$ be any independent subset of $M$.

Then:

No circuit $C$ of $M$ is a subset of $X$.


Proof
Let $C$ be a circuit of $M$.
By definition of matroid circuit:

$C$ is a dependent subset of $M$
From Independent Subset Contains No Dependent Subset:

$C$ is not a subset of $X$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

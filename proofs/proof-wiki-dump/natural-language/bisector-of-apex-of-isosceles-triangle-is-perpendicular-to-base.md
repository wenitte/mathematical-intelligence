Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be an isosceles triangle whose apex is $A$.
Let $AD$ be the bisector of $\angle BAC$ such that $AD$ intersects $BC$ at $D$.

Then $AD$ is perpendicular to $BC$.


Proof
By definition of isosceles triangle, $AB = AC$.
By definition of bisector, $\angle BAD = \angle CAD$.
By construction, $AD$ is common.
Thus by Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence, $\triangle ABD = \triangle ACD$.
Thus $\angle ADB = \angle ADC$.
By Two Angles on Straight Line make Two Right Angles, $\angle ADB + \angle ADC$ equals $2$ right angles.
Thus each of $\angle ADB$ and $\angle ADC$ are right angles.
The result follows by definition of perpendicular.
$\blacksquare$

Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $210$
A Famous Paradox
When a bicycle is in motion, does the upper part of each wheel move faster than the bottom part near the ground?


Solution
Obviously. Du-uh.


Proof
The part of the wheel that is in contact with the ground moves at the same speed relative to the ground that the ground does.
The conclusion follows in all its bletheringly obvious glory.
$\blacksquare$

How this can be considered "paradoxical" completely confounds me.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $P = \struct {\tau, \subseteq}$ be an inclusion ordered set of $\tau$.

Then $P$ is bounded below and $\bot_P = \O$


Proof
By Empty Set is Element of Topology:

$\O \in \tau$
By Empty Set is Subset of All Sets:

$\forall A \in \tau: \O \subseteq A$
Hence $P$ is bounded below.
Thus by definition of the smallest element:

$\bot_P = \O$
$\blacksquare$

Example of Complex Arithmetic
$3 \paren {1 + i} + 2 \paren {4 - 3 i} - \paren {2 + 5 i} = 9 - 8 i$


Proof
We have:














\(\ds 3 \paren {1 + i}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 + 3 i\)




















\(\ds 2 \paren {4 - 3 i}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8 - 6 i\)




















\(\ds -\paren {2 + 5 i}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -2 - 5 i\)









These can be depicted in the complex plane as follows:



To find the required sum, proceed as in the following diagram:


Construct $8 - 6 i$ with its initial point placed at the terminal point of $3 + 3 i$.
Construct $-2 - 5 i$ with its initial point placed at the terminal point of this instance of $8 - 6 i$.
The required resultant $3 \paren {1 + i} + 2 \paren {4 - 3 i} - \paren {2 + 5 i}$ is therefore represented by the terminal point of $-2 - 5 i$.
$\blacksquare$

Corollary to Mediant is Between
Let $a, b, c, d \in \Z$ be integers such that:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds b, d\)

\(>\)







\(\ds 0\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \dfrac a b\)

\(<\)







\(\ds \dfrac c d\)










Then the mediant of $\dfrac a b$ and $\dfrac c d$ is between $\dfrac a b$ and $\dfrac c d$:

$\dfrac a b < \dfrac {a + c} {b + d} < \dfrac c d$


Proof
By definition, $\dfrac a b$ and $\dfrac c d$ are rational numbers.
From Rational Numbers form Subfield of Real Numbers, $\dfrac a b, \dfrac c d \in \R$.
Hence from Mediant is Between:

$\dfrac a b < \dfrac {a + c} {b + d} < \dfrac c d$
$\blacksquare$

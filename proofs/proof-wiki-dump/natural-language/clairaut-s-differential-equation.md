Theorem
Clairaut's differential equation is a first order ordinary differential equation which can be put into the form:

$y = x y' + \map f {y'}$

Its general solution is:

$y = C x + \map f C$
where $C$ is a constant.


Proof
We have:

$y = x y' + \map f {y'}$
Differentiating the equation with respect to $x$ we have:














\(\ds y'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y' + x y + y \map {f'} {y'}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {y} {x + \map {f'} {y'} }\)











Proof for General Solution
The first solution is:














\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds C_1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds C_1 x + C_2\)










By substituting into the original equation, we obtain:














\(\ds C_1 x + C_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x C_1 + \map f {C_1}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds C_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {C_1}\)










Hence the result:

$y = C_1 x + \map f {C_1}$
$\blacksquare$

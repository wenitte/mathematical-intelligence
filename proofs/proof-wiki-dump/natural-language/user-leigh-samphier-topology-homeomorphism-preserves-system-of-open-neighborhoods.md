Theorem
Let $T_1 = \struct{S_1, \tau_1}$ and $T_2 = \struct{S_2, \tau_2}$ be topological spaces.
Let $f : T_1 \to T_2$ be a homeomorphism between $T_1$ and $T_2$.

Then:

$\forall x \in S_1 : f \sqbrk {\map \UU x} = \map \UU {\map f x}$
where $\map \UU x$ and $\map \UU {\map f x}$ denote the systems of open neighborhoods of $x$ and $\map f x$ respectively.


Proof
$\blacksquare$

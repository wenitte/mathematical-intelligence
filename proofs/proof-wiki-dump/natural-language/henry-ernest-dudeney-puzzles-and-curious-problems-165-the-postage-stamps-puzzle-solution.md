Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $165$
The Postage-Stamps Puzzle
A youth who collects postage stamps was asked how many he had in his collection, and he replied:
"The number, if divided by $2$, will give a remainder $1$;
divided by $3$, a remainder $2$;
divided by $4$, a remainder $3$;
divided by $5$, a remainder $4$;
divided by $6$, a remainder $5$;
divided by $7$, a remainder $6$;
divided by $8$, a remainder $7$;
divided by $9$, a remainder $8$;
divided by $10$, a remainder $9$.
But there are fewer than $3000$."
Can you tell how many stamps there were in the album?


Solution
$2519$.


Proof
Let $n$ be the number of stamps in the collection.
We have that $n + 1$ is divisible by $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, $9$ and $10$.
The smallest such $n + 1$ is $\lcm \set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}$ which is $8 \times 9 \times 5 \times 7 = 2520$.
No other number smaller than $3000$ fits the conditions.
Hence $n = 2519$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a compact space.

Then $T$ is countably compact.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a compact space.
Then by definition every open cover of $S$ has a finite subcover.
So every countable open cover of $S$ has a finite subcover.
Hence by definition $T$ is countably compact.
$\blacksquare$

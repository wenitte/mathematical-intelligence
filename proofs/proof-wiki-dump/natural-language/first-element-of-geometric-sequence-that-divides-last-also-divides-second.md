Theorem
Let $P = \sequence {a_j}_{0 \mathop \le j \mathop \le n}$ be a geometric sequence of integers of length $n$.
Let $a_0$ be a divisor of $a_n$.

Then $a_0$ is a divisor of $a_2$.

In the words of Euclid:

If there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and the first measures the last, it will measure the second also.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VIII}$: Proposition $7$)


Proof
By hypothesis, let $a_0$ be a divisor of $a_n$.
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $a_0$ is not a divisor of $a_2$.
From First Element of Geometric Sequence not dividing Second it would follow that $a_0$ does not divide $a_n$.
From this contradiction follows the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $7$ of Book $\text{VIII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

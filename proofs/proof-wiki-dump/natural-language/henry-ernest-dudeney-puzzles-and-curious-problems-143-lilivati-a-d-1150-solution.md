Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $143$
"Lilivati", A.D. $1150$
Beautiful maiden, with beaming eyes, tell me which is the number that, multiplied by $3$,
then increased by three-fourths of the product,
divided by $7$,
diminished by one-third of the quotient,
multiplied by itself,
diminished by $52$,
the square root found,
addition of $8$,
division by $10$,
gives the number $2$?


Solution
$28$


Proof
We simply reverse the order of operations, calculating as we go:














\(\ds 2 \times 10\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)





division by $10$














\(\ds 20 - 8\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)





addition of $8$














\(\ds 12^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 144\)





the square root found














\(\ds 144 + 52\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 196\)





diminished by $52$














\(\ds \sqrt {196}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 14\)





multiplied by itself














\(\ds 14 \div \paren {1 - \dfrac 1 3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 21\)





diminished by one-third of the quotient














\(\ds 21 \times 7\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 147\)





divided by $7$














\(\ds 147 \div \paren {1 + \dfrac 3 4}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 84\)





then increased by three-fourths of the product,














\(\ds 84 \div 3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 28\)





multiplied by $3$



Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
Henry Ernest Dudeney quotes this in its entirety as an example of one of the problems in Lilavati, by Bhaskara $\text {II}$ Acharya, dating from approximately $\text {1150}$$\text { C.E.}$
In Dudeney's words:

Here is another little morning problem from Lilivati (A.D. $1150$)...
... This, like so many of those old things, is absurdly easy when properly attacked.
It will be noted that he refers to it as Lilivati, which is most probably incorrect.

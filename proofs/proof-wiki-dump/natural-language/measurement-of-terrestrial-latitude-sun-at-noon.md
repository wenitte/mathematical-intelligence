Theorem
An observer's (terrestrial) latitude can be identified by measuring the (celestial) altitude of the Sun at noon.


Proof

This theorem requires a proof.In particular: Needs to reference the fact that the time of year needs to be known, and then tables can be used.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by crafting such a proof.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{ProofWanted}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.
Let $\alpha \in \R$ be a real number.

Then $\set \alpha$ is closed in $\struct {\R, \tau}$.


Proof
From Open Sets in Real Number Line, the set:

$SÂ := \openint \gets \alpha \cup \openint \alpha \to$
is open in $\R$.
Thus by definition of closed, its complement relative to $\R$:

$\R \setminus S = \set \alpha$
is closed in $\R$.
$\blacksquare$

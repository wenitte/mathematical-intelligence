Theorem
Let $U, V, W$ be vector spaces over a field $K$.
Let $G: U \to V$ be a degenerate linear transformation.
Let $N: W \to U$ be a linear transformation.

Then $G \circ N$ is degenerate.


Proof
Recall that the dimension of subspace is not greater than its super space.
Thus the claim follows from:

$\Img {G \circ N} \subseteq \Img G$
$\blacksquare$

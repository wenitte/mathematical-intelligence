Theorem
Let $\phi$ be a harmonic wave which is propagated along the $x$-axis in the positive direction with constant velocity $c$.
Then the disturbance of $\phi$ at point $x$ and time $t$ can be expressed using the equation:

$\map \phi {x, t} = a \map \cos {2 \pi \paren {\dfrac x \lambda - \nu t} }$
where:

$\lambda$ is the wavelength of $\phi$
$\nu$ is the frequency of $\phi$.


Proof













\(\ds \map \phi {x, t}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \map \cos {2 \pi \paren {\dfrac x \lambda - \dfrac t \tau} }\)





Equation of Harmonic Wave in terms of Wavelength and Period: $\tau$ is the period of $\phi$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \map \cos {2 \pi \paren {\dfrac x \lambda - \dfrac 1 \tau t} }\)





rearranging














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \map \cos {2 \pi \paren {\dfrac x \lambda - \nu t} }\)

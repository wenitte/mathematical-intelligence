Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space.
Let $X \subseteq A$ such that $X$ is finite.

Then $X$ has no limit points.


Proof
Let $x \in X$.
From Point in Finite Metric Space is Isolated, $x$ is an isolated point.
The result follows by definition of isolated point:

$x$ is an isolated point if and only if $x$ is not a limit point.
$\blacksquare$

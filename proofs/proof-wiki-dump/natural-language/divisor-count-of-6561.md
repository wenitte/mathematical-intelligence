Example of Use of Divisor Count Function
$\map {\sigma_0} {6561} = 9$
where $\sigma_0$ denotes the divisor count function.


Proof
From Divisor Count Function from Prime Decomposition:

$\ds \map {\sigma_0} n = \prod_{j \mathop = 1}^r \paren {k_j + 1}$
where:

$r$ denotes the number of distinct prime factors in the prime decomposition of $n$
$k_j$ denotes the multiplicity of the $j$th prime in the prime decomposition of $n$.

We have that:

$6561 = 3^8$
Thus:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_0} {6561}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\sigma_0} {3^8}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8 + 1\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9\)










The divisors of $6561$ can be enumerated as:

$1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561$

Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers.
Let $a \in \Q_p$.
Let $n \in \Z$.

Then the open ball $\map {B_{p^{-n}}} a$ and closed ball $\map {B^-_{p^{-n}}} a$ are clopen in the $p$-adic metric.


Proof
We begin by proving the theorem for the closed ball $\map {B^-_{p^{-n}}} a$.
From Open Ball in P-adic Numbers is Closed Ball then the theorem will be proved.

From P-adic Numbers form Non-Archimedean Valued Field::

$\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$ is a non-Archimedean division ring norm.
By definition the $p$-adic closed ball:

$\map {B^-_{p^{-n} } } a$ is a closed ball in a normed division ring.
From Closed Ball of Non-Archimedean Division Ring is Clopen:

$\map {B^-_{p^{-n} } } a$ is clopen in the $p$-adic metric.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

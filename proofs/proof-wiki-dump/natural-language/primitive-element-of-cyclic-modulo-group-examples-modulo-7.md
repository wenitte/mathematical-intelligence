Examples of Primitive Elements of Cyclic Modulo Group
Consider the multiplicative group of reduced residues $\Z'_p$.
The elements $\eqclass 3 7$ and $\eqclass 5 7$ are the primitive elements of $\Z'_p$.


Proof
From Multiplicative Group of Reduced Residues Modulo 7 is Cyclic it is demonstrated that $\eqclass 3 7$ is indeed a generator of $\Z'_p$.
It is also shown in passing that $\eqclass 5 7$ is the inverse of $\eqclass 3 7$.
It follows from Inverse of Generator of Cyclic Group is Generator that $\eqclass 5 7$ is therefore also a generator of $\Z'_p$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $f: S \to \R$ be a continuous real-valued function.

Then $f$ is not necessarily bounded.


Proof
Let $S$ denote the (open) real interval $\openint 0 1$.
Let $f: S \to \R$ denote the reciprocal function:

$\forall x \in S: \map f x = \dfrac 1 x$
From Reciprocal Function is Continuous on Real Numbers without Zero, $f$ is continuous on $S$.
From Reciprocal Function is Unbounded on Open Unit Interval, $f$ is unbounded on $S$.
Hence the result, by Proof by Counterexample.
$\blacksquare$

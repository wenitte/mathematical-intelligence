Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

To construct a solid angle out of three plane angles two of which, taken together in any manner, are greater than the remaining one: this the three angles must be less than four right angles.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XI}$: Proposition $23$)


Lemma
In the words of Euclid:

But how it is possible to take the square on $OR$ equal to that area by which the square on $AB$ is greater than the square on $LO$, we can show as follows.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XI}$: Proposition $23$ : Lemma)


Proof

Let $\angle ABC, \angle DEF, \angle GHK$ be the three given plane angles such that the sum of any two is greater than the remaining one.
That is:

$\angle ABC + \angle DEF > \angle GHK$
$\angle DEF + \angle GHK > \angle ABC$
$\angle GHK + \angle ABC > \angle DEF$
Thus it is required that a solid angle be constructed out of plane angles equal to $\angle ABC, \angle DEF, \angle GHK$.

Let the straight lines $AB, BC, DE, EF, GH, HK$ be equal.
Let $AC$, $DF$ and $GK$ be joined.


From Proposition $22$ of Book $\text{XI} $: Extremities of Line Segments containing three Plane Angles any Two of which are Greater than Other form Triangle:

Let the triangle $\triangle LMN$ be constructed so that:
$AC = LM$
$DF = MN$
$GK = NL$
Let the circle $LMN$ be described about $\triangle LMN$.
Let the center of the circle $LMN$ be $O$.
Let $LO, MO, NO$ be joined.

It is to be demonstrated that $AB > LO$.
Suppose to the contrary that $AB \le LO$.
Suppose $AB = LO$.
We have that $AB = BC$ and $OL = OM$.
Therefore we have that:

$AB$ and $BC$ are equal to $OL$ and $OM$
$AC = LM$ by hypothesis.
Therefore from Proposition $8$ of Book $\text{I} $: Triangle Side-Side-Side Congruence:

$\angle ABC = \angle LOM$
For the same reason:

$\angle DEF = \angle MON$
and:

$\angle GHK = \angle NOL$.
But $\angle LOM + \angle MON + \angle NOL$ equals $4$ right angles.
Therefore $\angle ABC + \angle DEF + \angle GHK$ equals $4$ right angles.
But by hypothesis $\angle ABC + \angle DEF + \angle GHK$ is less than $4$ right angles.
Therefore $AB \ne LO$.

Now suppose that $AB < LO$.
Let $OP = AB$ and $OQ = BC$.
Let $PQ$ be joined.
We have that

$AB = BC$
and:

$OP = OQ$
so:

$LP = QM$
Therefore from Proposition $2$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Parallel Transversal Theorem:

$LM \parallel PQ$
and from Proposition $29$ of Book $\text{I} $: Parallelism implies Equal Corresponding Angles:

$\triangle LMO$ is equiangular with $\triangle PQO$
Therefore from Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Equiangular Triangles are Similar:

$OL : LM = OP : PQ$
and from Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{V} $: Proportional Magnitudes are Proportional Alternately:

$LO : OP = LM : PQ$
But $LO > OP$.
Therefore $LM > PQ$.
But $LM = AC$.
Therefore $AC > PQ$.
We have that:

$AB$ and $BC$ equal $PO$ and $OQ$
and:

$AC > PQ$
Therefore from Proposition $25$ of Book $\text{I} $: Converse Hinge Theorem:

$\angle ABC > \angle POQ$
Similarly it can be proved that:

$\angle DEF > \angle MON$
and:

$\angle GHK > \angle NOL$
Therefore:

$\angle ABC + \angle DEF + \angle GHK > \angle LOM + \angle MON + \angle NOL$
But by hypothesis $\angle ABC + \angle DEF + \angle GHK$ is less than $4$ right angles.
Therefore $\angle LOM + \angle MON + \angle NOL$ is less than $4$ right angles.
But $\angle LOM + \angle MON + \angle NOL$ equals $4$ right angles.
Therefore $AB \not \le LO$.
It follows that $AB > LO$.
$\Box$

From Proposition $12$ of Book $\text{XI} $: Construction of Straight Line Perpendicular to Plane from point on Plane:

Let $OR$ be set up from $O$ perpendicular to the plane of the circle $LMN$.
Using Lemma to Proposition $12$ of Book $\text{XI} $: Construction of Solid Angle from Three Plane Angles any Two of which are Greater than Other Angle:

the square on $AB$ is greater than the square on $LO$.
Let $RL$, $RM$ and $RN$ be joined.
We have that $RO$ is perpendicular to the plane of the circle $LMN$.
Therefore $RO$ is perpendicular to each of the straight lines $LO$, $MO$ and $NO$.
We have that:

$LO = OM$
and

$OR$ is common and perpendicular
so from Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{I} $: Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence:

$RL = RM$
For the same reason:

$RN = RL = RM$

By hypothesis:

$AB^2 = LO^2 + OR^2$
But from Proposition $47$ of Book $\text{I} $: Pythagoras's Theorem:

$LR^2 = LO^2 + OR^2$
as $\angle LOR$ is a right angle.
Therefore:

$AB^2 = RL^2$
and so:

$AB = RL$

But $RL = RM = RN$.
Therefore:

$AB = BC = DE = EF = GH = HK = RL = RM = RN$
So we have:

$LR$ and $RM$ are equal to $AB$ and $BC$
and by hypothesis:

$LM = AC$
Therefore from Proposition $8$ of Book $\text{I} $: Triangle Side-Side-Side Congruence:

$\angle LRM = \angle ABC$
For the same reason:

$\angle MRN = \angle DEF$
and:

$\angle LRN = \angle GHK$
Therefore out of the three plane angles $\angle LRM, \angle MRN, \angle LRN$ which are equal to the plane angles $\angle ABC, \angle DEF, \angle GHK$, the solid angle $R$ has been constructed which is contained by the three plane angles $\angle LRM, \angle MRN, \angle LRN$.
$\blacksquare$

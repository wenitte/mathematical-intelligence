Theorem
A doughnut and a mug coffee mug are homeomorphic.


Proof
They are both solid objects with one hole.
A classical doughnut is in the shape of a torus.
That is, it is a solid figure with one hole.
The classic coffee-cup shape is a receptacle with a closed loop of china forming a handle.
The hole through which you put your fingers is homeomorphic to the hole in the doughnut.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $Q$ denote the quaternion group.

There exists a normal subgroup of $Q$ which has no complement.


Proof
From Subgroups of Quaternion Group:

The subsets of $Q$ which form subgroups of $Q$ are:














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds Q\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set e\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, a^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, a, a^2, a^3}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, b, a^2, a^2 b}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, a b, a^2, a^3 b}\)










From Quaternion Group is Hamiltonian we have that all of these subgroups of $Q$ are normal.

From Quaternion Group is Hamiltonian, all these subgroups are normal.
For two subgroups to be complementary, they need to have an intersection which is trivial.
However, apart from $\set e$ itself, all these subgroups contain $a^2$.
Hence none of these subgroups has a complement.

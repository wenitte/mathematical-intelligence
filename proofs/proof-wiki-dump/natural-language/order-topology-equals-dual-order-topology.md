Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be a totally ordered set.
Let $\tau$ be the $\preceq$-order topology on $S$.
Let $\tau'$ be the $\succeq$-order topology on $S$, where $\succeq$ is the dual ordering of $\preceq$.

Then $\tau' = \tau$.


Proof

Although this article appears correct, it's inelegant. There has to be a better way of doing it.In particular: recast in terms of dual statementsYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by redesigning it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Improve}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Let $U$ be an open ray in $\struct {S, \preceq}$.
By Open Ray is Dual to Open Ray, $U$ is an open ray in $\struct {S, \preceq}$.
Since the open rays in a totally ordered set form a sub-basis for the topology on that set, $\tau'$ is finer than $\tau$.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Invoke some other duality principle?You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
By the same argument, $\tau$ is finer than $\tau'$.
Thus by definition of set equality:

$\tau' = \tau$
$\blacksquare$

Problem
Dissect $2$ regular hexagons, and use the pieces to make $1$ larger regular hexagon.


Solution

Dissect one of the regular hexagons into $6$ equal triangles as shown on the left.
Arrange these triangles around the outside of the other regular hexagon as shown on the right.
Join the $6$ obtuse angles of those $6$ triangles to make a larger regular hexagon.
The overlapping bits are then cut off and are fitted into the gaps.
$\blacksquare$

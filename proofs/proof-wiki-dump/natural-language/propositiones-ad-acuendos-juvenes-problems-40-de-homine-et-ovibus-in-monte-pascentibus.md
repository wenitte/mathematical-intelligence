Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $40$
De Homine et Ovibus in Monte Pascentibus
A Man and some Sheep Grazing on the Hillside
A man looked at some sheep grazing on the hillside, and said,
"I wish I had these,
and as many again,
plus half of half that total,
plus half of that last amount;
then, counting myself, I would take $100$ to my home.
How many sheep did he see?


Solution
$36$.


Proof
Let $x$ be the number of sheep seen.
Then we have:

$x + x + \dfrac {x + x} 4 + \dfrac 1 2 \paren {\dfrac {x + x} 4} + 1 = 100$
That is, after algebra:

$\dfrac {11 x} 4 = 99$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The alert reader will note that this is numerically identical to Problems $2$: De Viro Ambulante in Via.

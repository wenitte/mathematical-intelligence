Theorem
All perfect numbers which are even are triangular.


Proof 1
Let $a$ be an even perfect number.
From the Theorem of Even Perfect Numbers, $a$ is in the form $2^{p - 1} \left({2^p - 1}\right)$ where $2^p - 1$ is prime.
Thus:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \left({2^p - 1}\right) 2^{p - 1}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \left({2^p - 1}\right) \frac {2^p} 2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {n \left({n + 1}\right)} 2\)





where $n = 2^p - 1$



The result follows from Closed Form for Triangular Numbers.

Proof 2
Follows from:

Even Perfect Number is Hexagonal
Hexagonal Number is Triangular Number

Corollary to Non-Trivial Discrete Space is not Connected
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a non-trivial discrete topological space.

$T$ is not irreducible.


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $T$ is irreducible.
From Irreducible Space is Connected, we have that $T$ is connected.
But this directly contradicts Non-Trivial Discrete Space is not Connected.
The result follows from Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

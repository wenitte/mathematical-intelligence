Corollary to Common Divisor in Integral Domain Divides Linear Combination
Let $c$ be a common divisor of two integers $a$ and $b$.
That is:

$a, b, c \in \Z: c \divides a \land c \divides b$

Then $c$ divides any integer combination of $a$ and $b$:

$\forall p, q \in \Z: c \divides \paren {p a + q b}$


Proof
We have that the Integers form Integral Domain.
The result then follows from Common Divisor in Integral Domain Divides Linear Combination.
$\blacksquare$

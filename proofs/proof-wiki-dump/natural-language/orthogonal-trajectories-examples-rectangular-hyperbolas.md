Theorem
Consider the one-parameter family of curves of rectangular hyperbolas:

$(1): \quad x y = c$

Its family of orthogonal trajectories is given by the equation:

$x^2 - y^2 = c$





Proof
We use the technique of formation of ordinary differential equation by elimination.
Differentiating $(1)$ with respect to $x$ gives:

$x \dfrac {\d y} {\d x} + y = 0$













\(\ds x \frac {\d y} {\d x} + y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\frac y x\)










Thus from Orthogonal Trajectories of One-Parameter Family of Curves, the family of orthogonal trajectories is given by:

$\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} = \dfrac x y$

So:














\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac x y\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \int x \rd x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \int y \rd y\)





Solution to Separable Differential Equation








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y^2 + c\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 - y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c\)









Hence the result.

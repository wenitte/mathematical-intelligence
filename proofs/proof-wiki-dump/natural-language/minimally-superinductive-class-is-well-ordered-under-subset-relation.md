Theorem
Let $M$ be a class.
Let $g: M \to M$ be a progressing mapping on $M$.
Let $M$ be minimally superinductive under $g$.

Then $M$ is well-ordered under the subset relation.


Proof
We have a priori that $M$ is a $g$-tower.
The result follows from $g$-Tower is Well-Ordered under Subset Relation.
$\blacksquare$

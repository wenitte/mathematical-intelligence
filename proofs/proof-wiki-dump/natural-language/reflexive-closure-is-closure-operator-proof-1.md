Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $R$ be the set of all endorelations on $S$.

Then the reflexive closure operator on $R$ is a closure operator.


Proof
Let $\QQ$ be the set of reflexive relations on $S$.
By Intersection of Reflexive Relations is Reflexive, the intersection of any subset of $\QQ$ is in $Q$.
By the definition of reflexive closure as the intersection of reflexive supersets:

The reflexive closure of a relation $\RR$ on $S$ is the intersection of elements of $\QQ$ that contain $S$.
From Closure Operator from Closed Sets we conclude that reflexive closure is a closure operator.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The operation of multiplication on the set of natural numbers $\N$ is associative:

$\forall x, y, z \in \N: \paren {x \times y} \times z = x \times \paren {y \times z}$


Proof
From Index Laws for Semigroup: Product of Indices we have:

$+^{z \times y} x = \map {+^z} {+^y x}$
By definition of multiplication, this amounts to:

$x \times \paren {z \times y} = \paren {x \times y} \times z$
From Natural Number Multiplication is Commutative, we have:

$x \times \paren {z \times y} = x \times \paren {y \times z}$
$\blacksquare$

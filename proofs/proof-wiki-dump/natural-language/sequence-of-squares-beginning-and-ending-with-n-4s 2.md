Sequence
The following sequence:














\(\ds 484\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 22^2\)




















\(\ds 44 \, 944\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 212^2\)




















\(\ds 444 \, 171 \, 597 \, 444\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 666 \, 462^2\)









cannot be continued, as it is not possible for there to be a square number ending in $\ldots 4444$.


Proof
Let $n = 10000 k + 4444$.
We have:














\(\ds \frac n 4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2500 k + 1111\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 3 \pmod 4\)









By Square Modulo 4, $\dfrac n 4$ cannot be a square number.
Therefore neither can $n = 4 \times \dfrac n 4$ be a square number.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
David Wells, in his $1997$ work Curious and Interesting Numbers, 2nd ed., attributes this result to Michel Criton, but gives no details.

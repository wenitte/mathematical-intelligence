Theorem
Every recursive functionâ€Ž is URM computable.


Proof
From:

Functions obtained by minimization from URM computable functions are URM computable
Functions obtained by minimization from URM computable relations are URM computable
Functions obtained by primitive recursion from URM computable functions are URM computable
Functions obtained by substitution from URM computable functions are URM computable
Primitive Recursive Function is URM Computable
Primitive Recursive Relation is URM Computable
it follows that all the functions obtained from the basic primitive recursive functions using the operations of substitution, primitive recursion and minimization (on a function or a relation) are URM computable.

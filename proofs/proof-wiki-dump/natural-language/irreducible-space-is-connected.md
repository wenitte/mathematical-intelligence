Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is irreducible.

Then $T$ is connected.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be irreducible.
Then:

$\forall U_1, U_2 \in \tau: U_1, U_2 \ne \O \implies U_1 \cap U_2 \ne \O$
So trivially there are no two open sets that can form a separation of $T$.
The result follows from definition of connected.
$\blacksquare$

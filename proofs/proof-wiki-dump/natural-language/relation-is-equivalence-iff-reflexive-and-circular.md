Theorem
Let $\RR \subseteq S \times S$ be a relation in $S$.
Then:

$\RR$ is reflexive and circular
if and only if:

$\RR$ is an equivalence relation.


Proof
Sufficient Condition
Let $\RR$ be reflexive and circular.
Then from Reflexive Circular Relation is Equivalence:

$\RR$ is an equivalence relation.
$\Box$


Necessary Condition
Let $\RR$ be an equivalence relation.
We have a fortiori:

$\RR$ is reflexive.
Then from Equivalence Relation is Circular:

$\RR$ is circular.
$\blacksquare$

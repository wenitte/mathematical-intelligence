Theorem
Let $x$ be an irrational number.

Then the continued fraction expansion of $x$ is the unique simple infinite continued fraction that converges to $x$.


Proof
Follows from:

Continued Fraction Expansion of Irrational Number Converges to Number Itself
Simple Infinite Continued Fraction is Uniquely Determined by Limit.
$\blacksquare$

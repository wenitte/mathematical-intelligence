Theorem
Let $T$ be a finite connected simple graph of order $n$.
Let the size of $T$ be $n - 1$.

Then $T$ is a (finite) tree.


Proof
Let $T$ is a connected simple graph of order $n$ with size $n - 1$.
From Finite Connected Simple Graph with Size One Less than Order has no Circuits:

$T$ has no circuits.
Hence $T$ is a tree by definition.
$\blacksquare$

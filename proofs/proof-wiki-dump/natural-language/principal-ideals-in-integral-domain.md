Theorem
Let $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ be an integral domain.
Let $U_D$ be the group of units of $D$.
Let $\ideal x$ be the principal ideal of $D$ generated by $x$.
Let $x, y \in \struct {D, +, \circ}$.

Then:


Element in Integral Domain is Divisor iff Principal Ideal is Superset
$x \divides y \iff \ideal y \subseteq \ideal x$


Element in Integral Domain is Unit iff Principal Ideal is Whole Domain
$x \in U_D \iff \ideal x = D$


Elements in Integral Domain are Associates iff Principal Ideals are Equal
We are to show that:

$x \divides y \text{ and } y \divides x \iff \ideal x = \ideal y$

Thus:

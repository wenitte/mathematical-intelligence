Theorem
Let $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ be an integral domain which is not a field.
Then $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ has an infinite number of distinct ideals.


Proof
Let $a \in D$ be a proper element of $D$.
Because $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ is not a field, such an element is known to exist.

From Principal Ideal in Integral Domain generated by Power Plus One is Subset of Principal Ideal generated by Power:

$\forall n \in \Z_{\ge 0}: \ideal {a^{n + 1} } \subsetneq \ideal {a_n}$
where $\ideal x$ denotes the principal ideal of $D$ generated by $x$.

Hence the set:

$S = \set {\ideal {1_D}, \ideal a, \ideal {a^2}, \ideal {a^3}, \dotsc}$
is infinite.
$\blacksquare$

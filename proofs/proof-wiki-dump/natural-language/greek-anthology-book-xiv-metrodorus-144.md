Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
$A$. How heavy is the base I have to stand on together with myself!
$B$. And my base together together with myself weighs the same number of talents.
$A$. But I alone weigh twice as much as your base.
$B$: And I alone weigh three times the weight of yours.


Solution
Presumably $A$ and $B$ are talking statues.

Let $a$ talents be the weight of $A$.
Let $b$ talents be the weight of $B$.
Let $c$ talents be the weight of $A$'s base.
Let $d$ talents be the weight of $B$'s base.

We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds a + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b + d\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 d\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 c\)









We have $3$ simultaneous equations in $4$ unknowns.
Hence we cannot calculate the actual weights, but the proportions only.

So:














\(\ds 2 d + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 c + d\)





substituting from $(2)$ and $(3)$ into $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 c\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 c\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 c\)










So, taking the base of $A$ as a unit, we have:

$A$ weighs $4$ times its base
$B$ weighs $3$ times the base of $A$
the base of $B$ weighs twice the base of $B$.
$\blacksquare$


Source of Name
This entry was named for Metrodorus.


Historical Note
In W.R. Paton's $1918$ translation of The Greek Anthology Book XIV, he gives the answer as:

From these data not the actual weights but the proportions alone can be determined.
The statue $A$ was a third part heavier than $B$, and $B$ only weighed $\dfrac 3 4$ of the statue $A$.
The base of $B$ weighed thrice as much as the base of $A$.

This appears to be incorrect.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.

Then $\O$ is closed in $T$.


Proof
From the definition of closed set, $U$ is open in $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ if and only if $S \setminus U$ is closed in $T$.
By definition of topological space, $S$ is open in $T$.
From Set Difference with Self is Empty Set:

$S \setminus S = \O$
Hence $\O$ is closed in $T$.
$\blacksquare$

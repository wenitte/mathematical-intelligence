Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $f, g :S \to \R$ be continuous real-valued functions.
Let $-f : S \to \R$ denote the pointwise negation of $f$, that is, $-f$ denotes the mapping defined by:

$\forall s \in S : \map {\paren{-f} } s = - \map f s$

Then:

$-f$ is a continuous real-valued function


Proof
Follows from:

Real Numbers form Valued Field
By definition a valued field is a normed division ring
Negation Rule for Continuous Mappings into Normed Division Ring
$\blacksquare$

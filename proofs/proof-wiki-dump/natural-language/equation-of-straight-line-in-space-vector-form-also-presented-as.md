Vector Equation of Straight Line in Space: Also presented as
Let $a$ and $b$ be points in cartesian $3$-space with position vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ respectively.

The vector form of the equation of a straight line in space can be presented in the forms:

$\mathbf r = \mathbf a + t \paren {\mathbf b - \mathbf a}$
or:

$\paren {\mathbf r - \mathbf a} \times \paren {\mathbf b - \mathbf a} = \mathbf 0$
which is the same straight line.


Proof
We have that $\mathbf r = \mathbf a + t \paren {\mathbf b - \mathbf a}$ is exactly the same form as $\mathbf r = \mathbf a + t \mathbf b$ but substituting $\mathbf b - \mathbf a$ for $\mathbf b$.
From the exposition of the proof, $\mathbf r = \mathbf a + t \mathbf b$ is all the points in the straight line passing through $a$ parallel to $\mathbf b$.
Hence $\mathbf r = \mathbf a + t \paren {\mathbf b - \mathbf a}$ is all the points in the straight line passing through $a$ parallel to $\mathbf b - \mathbf a$.
But $\mathbf b - \mathbf a$ is the vector that takes you:

from $a$, whose position vector is $\mathbf a$
to $b$, whose position vector is $\mathbf b$.
Hence $b$ is itself on the straight line passing through $\mathbf a$ parallel to $\mathbf b - \mathbf a$.
Hence $\mathbf r = \mathbf a + t \paren {\mathbf b - \mathbf a}$ is the straight line passing through $a$ and $b$.
$\Box$

We note that, by Cross Product of Parallel Vectors:

$\paren {\mathbf r - \mathbf a} \times \paren {\mathbf b - \mathbf a} = \mathbf 0$
defines the set of points in $\R^3$ passing through $\mathbf a$ parallel to $\mathbf b - \mathbf a$.
That is, from the above, the set of points in the straight line passing through $a$ and $b$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Pi squared ($\pi^2$) is irrational.


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $\pi^2$ is rational.

We establish a lemma:

Lemma
Let $n \in \Z_{\ge 0}$ be a positive integer.

Let it be supposed that $\pi^2$ is irrational, so that:

$\pi^2 = \dfrac p q$
where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \ne 0$.

Let $A_n$ be defined as:

$\ds A_n = \frac \pi 2 \frac {p^n} {n!}  \int_0^1 \paren {1 - x^2 }^n \map \cos {\dfrac {\pi x} 2} \rd x$
Then:

$A_n = \paren {16 n - 8} q A_{n - 1} - 16 p q A_{n - 2}$
is a reduction formula for $A_n$.
$\Box$

We will use the definition of $A_n$ from the lemma.
Then we will deduce that $A_n$ is an integer for all $n$.

First we confirm by direct integration that $A_0$ and $A_1$ are integers:

\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds p \paren {\frac 8 {p / q} }\)





assuming $\pi^2 = \dfrac p q$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8 q\)










Suppose $A_{k - 2}$ and $A_{k - 1}$ are integers. 
By our lemma:

$A_k = \paren {16 n - 8} q A_{k - 1} - 16 p q A_{k - 2}$

As $n$, $p$ and $q$ are all integers by hypothesis, $A_k$ is also an integer.

So $A_n$ is an integer for all $n$ by Second Principle of Mathematical Induction.
$\Box$

Let $x \in \closedint 0 1$.
From Shape of Cosine Function and Real Cosine Function is Bounded, we have:

$0 \le \map \cos {\dfrac {\pi x} 2} \le 1$
From Derivative at Maximum or Minimum, we have:














\(\ds \map f x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {1 - x^2}^n\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {f'} x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n \paren {1 - x^2}^{n - 1} \paren {-2 x}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n \paren {1 - x^2}^{n - 1} \paren {-2 x}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





$0$ is the maximum $\map f 0 = 1$ and $\pm 1$ is the minimum $\map f {\pm 1} = 0$



Therefore, plugging $0$ into $\map f x$, we obtain:

$0 \le \paren {1 - x^2}^n \le 1$
Since $A_n$ is clearly positive and the length of the interval is $1$ and the integrand is bounded at $\paren {1}^n$, from Darboux's Theorem, we have:

$0 < A_n < 1 \times \dfrac \pi 2 \times \dfrac {p^n} {n!} \times \paren {1}^n$
From Power over Factorial:

$\ds \lim_{n \mathop \to \infty} \dfrac {p^n} {n!} = 0$
It follows from the Squeeze Theorem that:

$\ds \lim_{n \mathop \to \infty} A_n = 0$
Hence for sufficiently large $n$, $A_n$ is strictly between $0$ and $1$.
This contradicts the deduction that $A_n$ is an integer.
This depends on our supposition that $\pi^2$ is a rational number,
Hence by Proof by Contradiction it follows that $\pi^2$ is irrational.

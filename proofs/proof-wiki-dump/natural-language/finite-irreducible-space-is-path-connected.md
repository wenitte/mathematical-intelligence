Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a finite irreducible topological space.

Then $T$ is path-connected.


Proof
By Power Set of Finite Set is Finite, the power set $\powerset S$ is finite.
By Subset of Finite Set is Finite, $\tau \subseteq \powerset S$ is finite.
The result follows from Irreducible Space with Finitely Many Open Sets is Path-Connected.
$\blacksquare$

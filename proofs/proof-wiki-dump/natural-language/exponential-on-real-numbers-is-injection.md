Theorem
Let $\exp: \R \to \R$ be the exponential function:

$\map \exp x = e^x$

Then $\exp$ is an injection.

Proof
From Exponential is Strictly Increasing:

$\exp$ is strictly increasing on $\R$.
From Strictly Monotone Mapping with Totally Ordered Domain is Injective:

$\exp$ is an injection.
$\blacksquare$

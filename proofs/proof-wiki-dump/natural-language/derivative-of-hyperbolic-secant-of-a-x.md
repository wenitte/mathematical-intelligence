Theorem
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sech a x} = -a \sech a x \tanh a x$


Proof













\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sech x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\sech x \tanh x\)





Derivative of $\sech x$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sech a x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -a \sech a x \tanh a x\)

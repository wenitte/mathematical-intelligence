Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a division ring whose zero is $0_R$.
The only ideals of $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ are $\set {0_R}$ and $R$ itself.

That is, $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ has no non-null proper ideals.


Proof
From Null Ring is Ideal, $\set {0_R}$ is an ideal of $\struct {R, +, \circ}$, as $\struct {R, +, \circ}$, being a division ring, is also a ring.
By definition, every non-zero element of a division ring is a unit.
So $S \ne \set {0_R} \implies \exists x \in S: x \ne 0_R$ such that $r$ is a unit of $R$.
The result follows from Ideal of Unit is Whole Ring.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $x$ and $y$ be ordinals.

Then:

$x \in \aleph_y \iff \card x \in \aleph_y$
where $\aleph$ denotes the aleph mapping.


Proof
By the definition of the aleph mapping, $\aleph_y$ is an element of the class of infinite cardinals.
By Cardinal Inequality implies Ordinal Inequality, it follows that:

$x \in \aleph_y \iff \card x \in \aleph_y$
$\blacksquare$

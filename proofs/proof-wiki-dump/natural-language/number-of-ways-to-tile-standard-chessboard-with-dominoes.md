Theorem
The number of ways to tile a standard ($8 \times 8$) chessboard with dominoes is $12 \, 988 \, 816$.


Proof
Follows directly from Kasteleyn's Formula for $m = n = 8$:

$\ds \prod_{j \mathop = 1}^{\ceiling {\frac 8 2} } \prod_{k \mathop = 1}^{\ceiling {\frac 8 2} } \paren {4 \cos^2 \frac {\pi j} {8 + 1} + 4 \cos^2 \frac {\pi k} {8 + 1} } = 12 \, 988 \, 816$
$\blacksquare$

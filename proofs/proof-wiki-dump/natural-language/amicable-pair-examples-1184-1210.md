Example of Amicable Pair
$1184$ and $1210$ are the $2$nd amicable pair:

$\map {\sigma_1} {1184} = \map {\sigma_1} {1210} = 2394 = 1184 + 1210$


Proof
Let $\map s n$ denote the aliquot sum of $n$.
By definition:

$\map s n = \map {\sigma_1} n - n$
where $\sigma_1$ denotes the divisor sum function.

Thus:














\(\ds \map s {1184}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {1184} - 1184\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2394 - 1184\)





$\sigma_1$ of $1184$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1210\)
























\(\ds \map s {1210}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {1210} - 1210\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2394 - 1210\)





$\sigma_1$ of $1210$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1184\)









$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The amicable pair $1184$ and $1210$ was discovered by Nicolò Paganini in $1866$, at the age of $16$.
It is remarkable that it had until that time escaped being found, even by Leonhard Paul Euler's systematic exploration.

Theorem
$\forall x \in \R: x < 0 \implies \dfrac 1 x < 0$


Proof
Let $x < 0$.
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $\dfrac 1 x > 0$.
Then:














\(\ds x\)

\(<\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x \times \dfrac 1 x\)

\(<\)







\(\ds 0 \times 0\)





Real Number Ordering is Compatible with Multiplication: Negative Factor








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 1\)

\(<\)







\(\ds 0\)





Real Number Axiom $\R \text A4$: Inverses for Addition




But from Real Zero is Less than Real One:

$1 > 0$

Therefore by Proof by Contradiction:

$\dfrac 1 x < 0$
$\blacksquare$

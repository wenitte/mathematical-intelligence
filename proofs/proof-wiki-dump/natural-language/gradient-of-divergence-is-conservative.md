Theorem
Let $\map {\R^3} {x, y, z}$ denote the real Cartesian space of $3$ dimensions.
Let $\mathbf V$ be a vector field on $\R^3$:

Then the gradient of the divergence of $\mathbf V$ is a conservative vector field.


Proof
The divergence of $\mathbf V$ is by definition a scalar field.
Then from Vector Field is Expressible as Gradient of Scalar Field iff Conservative it follows that $\grad \operatorname {div} \mathbf V$ is a conservative vector field.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Problem in Algebra
The first man has $16$ azure-blue gems,
the second man has $10$ emeralds,
and the third has $8$ diamonds.
Each among them gives to each of the others $2$ gems of the kind owned by himself;
and then all $3$ men come to be possessed of equal wealth.
What are the prices of those azure-blue gems, emeralds and diamonds?


Solution
Let $b$, $e$ and $d$ denote the value of the azure-blue, emerald and diamond respectively.
Then:

$b : e : d = 2 : 5 : 10$
Without knowing the price of any of the gems in any given monetary units, the best that can be done is to give their ratios.


Proof
We are given:














\(\ds \paren {16 - 4} b + 2 e + 2 d\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds \paren {10 - 4} e + 2 b + 2 d \, \)

\(\, \ds = \, \)



\(\ds \paren {8 - 4} d + 2 b + 2 e\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 12 b + 2 e + 2 d\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds 6 e + 2 b + 2 d \, \)

\(\, \ds = \, \)



\(\ds 4 d + 2 b + 2 e\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 10 b\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds 4 e \, \)

\(\, \ds = \, \)



\(\ds 2 d\)





subtracting $2 b + 2 e + 2 d$ from each expression








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac b 2\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds \dfrac e 5 \, \)

\(\, \ds = \, \)



\(\ds \dfrac d {10}\)





dividing by $20$ throughout



That is:














\(\ds 5 b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 e\)




















\(\ds 10 e\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 d\)









and the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

This problem is given by David Wells in his Curious and Interesting Puzzles of $1992$ without any indication of its source.
A study of the sources which he quotes may reveal where he got it from, but this is work that is still to be done.

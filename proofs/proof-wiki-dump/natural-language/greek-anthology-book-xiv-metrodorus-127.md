Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
Demochares lived for a quarter of his whole life as a boy,
for a fifth part of it a young man,
and for a third as a man,
and when he reached grey old age he lived thirteen years more on the threshold of eld.


Solution
Let $n$ be the age in years of Demochares at his death.

$\dfrac n 4$ was spent as a boy
$\dfrac n 5$ was spent as a young man
$\dfrac n 3$ was spent as a man
$13$ more years were spent as an old man.

We have:














\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac n 4 + \dfrac n 5 + \dfrac n 3 + 13\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 60 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 15 n + 12 n + 20 n + 60 \times 13\)





multiplying through by $60 = \lcm \set {4, 5, 3}$ and simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {60 - 15 - 12 - 20} n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60 \times 13\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 13 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60 \times 13\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60\)










So Demochares lived for $60$ years, of which:

$15$ years were spent as a boy
$12$ years were spent as a young man
$20$ years were spent as a man
and as we know:

$13$ more years were spent as an old man.
$\blacksquare$

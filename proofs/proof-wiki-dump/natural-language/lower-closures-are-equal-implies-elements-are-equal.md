Theorem
Let $L = \struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $x, y \in S$ such that

$x^\preceq = y^\preceq$
where $x^\preceq$ denotes the lower closure of $x$.

Then $x = y$

Proof
By definitions of lower closure of element and reflexivity:

$x \in x^\preceq$ and $y \in y^\preceq$
By definition of lower closure of element:

$x \preceq y$ and $y \preceq x$
Thus by definition of antisymmetry:

$x = y$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$360$ has the property that its ratio to its aliquot sum is $4 : 9$.


Proof
The aliquot sum of an integer $n$ is the integer sum  of the aliquot parts of $n$.
That is, the aliquot sum of $360$ is the divisor sum of $360$ minus $360$.
Thus:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {360} - 360\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1170 - 360\)





$\sigma_1$ of $360$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 810\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4 \times \paren {\map {\sigma_1} {360} - 360}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3240\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 \times 360\)









$\blacksquare$

Historical Note
Leonard Eugene Dickson reports in his $1919$ work History of the Theory of Numbers, Volume I that this result was noted by Marin Mersenne.

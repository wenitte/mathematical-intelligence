Theorem
Let $A$ be a non-empty class.
Let $\bigcap A$ denote the intersection of $A$.

Then $\bigcap A$ is a set.


Proof
Since $A$ is a non-empty class, there exists $S \in A$.
Since $S$ is an element of a class, it is not a proper class, and is thus a set.
By definition of class intersection:

$x \in \bigcap A \implies x \in S$
By the subclass definition:

$\bigcap A \subseteq S$
By Subclass of Set is Set, $\bigcap A$ is a set.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\alpha$ be a cut.
Let $p^*$ be the rational cut associated with a rational number $p$.

Then:

$p \in \alpha$
if and only if:

$p^* < \alpha$
where $<$ denotes the strict ordering on cuts.


Proof
Let $p$ be a rational number such that $p \in \alpha$.
Then by definition of rational cut:

$p \notin p^*$
Thus:

$p \in \alpha \implies p^* < \alpha$
$\Box$

Let $p^* < \alpha$.
Then there exists a rational number $q$ such that $q \in \alpha$ and $q \notin p$.
Thus $q \ge p$.
But as $q \in \alpha$ it follows that $p \in \alpha$.
$\blacksquare$

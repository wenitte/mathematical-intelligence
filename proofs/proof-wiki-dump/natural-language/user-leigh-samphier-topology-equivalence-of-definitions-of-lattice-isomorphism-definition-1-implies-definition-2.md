Theorem
Let $L1 = \struct {A_1, \vee_1, \wedge_1, \preceq_1}$ and $L2 = \struct {A_2, \vee_2, \wedge_2, \preceq_2}$ be lattices.

Let $\phi : L_1 \to L_2$ be a bijective lattice homomorphism.

Then:

$\phi : \struct{A_1, \preceq_1} \to \struct{A_2, \preceq_2}$ is an order isomorphism by definition.


Proof
From Lattice Homomorphism is Order-Preserving:

$\phi : \struct{A_1, \preceq_1} \to \struct{A_2, \preceq_2}$ is order-preserving

Hence $\phi : \struct{A_1, \preceq_1} \to \struct{A_2, \preceq_2}$ is an order isomorphism by definition.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a regular topological space.
Let $\BB$ be a $\sigma$-locally finite basis.

Then:

$T$ is a perfectly normal space


Proof
By definition of regular topological space:

$T$ is a $T_3$ space
$T$ is a $T_0$ (Kolmogorov) space
From T3 Space with Sigma-Locally Finite Basis is Perfectly T4 Space:

$T$ is a perfectly $T_4$ space
From Regular Space is $T_2$ Space:

$T$ is a $T_2$ space
From $T_2$ Space is $T_1$ Space:

$T$ is a $T_1$ space
By definition, $T$ is a perfectly normal space.
$\blacksquare$

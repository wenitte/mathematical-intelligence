Theorem
Let $M = \struct {S, \mathscr I}$ be a matroid.
Let $C \subseteq S$ be a circuit of $M$.

Then every proper subset $A$ of $C$ is independent.


Proof
By definition of a circuit of $M$:

$C$ is a minimum dependent subset of $M$
By definition of the minimum dependent subset of $M$:

every proper subset $A$ of $C$ is not a dependent subset.
By definition of a dependent subset:

every proper subset $A$ of $C$ is an independent subset.
$\blacksquare$

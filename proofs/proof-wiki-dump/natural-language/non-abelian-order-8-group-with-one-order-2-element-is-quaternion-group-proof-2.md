Theorem
Let $G$ be a group with the following properties:

$(1): \quad G$ is non-abelian.
$(2): \quad G$ is of order $8$.
$(3): \quad G$ has precisely one element of order $2$.

Then $G$ is isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q$.


Proof
By Groups of Order 8, the only group satisfying all three properties is $Q = \Dic 2$.

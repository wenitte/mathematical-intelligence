Classic Problem
A dishonest butler removes $3$ pints of wine from a barrel, replacing them with water.
He repeats this theft twice, removing in total $9$ pints, each time replacing with water.
As a result, the wine in the barrel is half its normal strength, the rest being water.
How much wine was there in the barrel to start with?


Solution
$14.54$ pints.


Proof
Let $x$ pints be the total quantity of wine in the barrel to start with.
After the first theft, there are $x - 3$ pints left.
The concentration of wine is now $\dfrac {x - 3} x$.
So the second theft removes $3 \dfrac {x - 3} x$ pints of wine from the cask.
The concentration of wine is now $\dfrac {x - 3 - 3 \frac {x - 3} x} x$.
So the third theft removes $3 \dfrac {x - 3 - 3 \frac {x - 3} x} x$ pints of wine.
The total removed is now $\dfrac x 2$, and so:














\(\ds \frac x 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 + 3 \dfrac {x - 3} x + 3 \dfrac {x - 3 - 3 \frac {x - 3} x} x\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 \paren {x - 3}^3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x^3\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {3 \times \sqrt [3] 2} {\sqrt [3] 2 - 1}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 14.54\)

Historical Note
According to David Wells, in his Curious and Interesting Puzzles of $1992$, the Problem of the Dishonest Butler appears in one of the works of Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, but he does not say where.

Theorem
Let $\struct {\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr}$ be a probability space.
Let $X$ be an absolutely continuous random variable on $\struct {\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr}$. 

Then $X$ is a continuous random variable.


Proof
Let $F_X$ be the cumulative distribution function for $X$. 
From the definition of an absolutely continuous random variable, we have: 

$F_X$ is absolutely continuous.
From Absolutely Continuous Real Function is Continuous, we then have: 

$F_X$ is continuous.
Then, from the definition of a continuous random variable, we have: 

$X$ is a continuous random variable.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \preceq, \tau}$ and $Q = \struct {X, \preceq', \tau'}$ be complete topological lattices with lower topologies.
Let $f: S \to X$ be a mapping such that

$f$ preserves all infima.

Then $f$ is continuous mapping.


Proof
By assumption:

for all non-empty subsets $Y$ of $S$: $f$ preserves the infimum of $Y$.
Thus by Mapping Preserves Non-Empty Infima implies Mapping is Continuous in Lower Topological Lattice:

$f$ is continuous mapping.
$\blacksquare$

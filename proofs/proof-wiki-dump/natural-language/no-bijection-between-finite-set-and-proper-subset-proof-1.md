Theorem
A finite set can not be in one-to-one correspondence with one of its proper subsets.
That is, a finite set is not Dedekind-infinite.


Proof
Let $S$ be a finite set.
Let $T$ be a proper subset of $S$.
Let $f: T \to S$ be an injection.
By Cardinality of Image of Injection and Cardinality of Subset of Finite Set:

$\card {\Img f} = \card T < \card S$
where $\Img f$ denotes the image of $f$.
Thus $\Img f \ne S$, and so $f$ is not a bijection.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $z_1, z_2 \in \C$ be complex numbers.
Let $L$ be a straight line through $z_1$ and $z_2$ in the complex plane.

$L$ can be expressed by the equation:

$z = z_1 + t \paren {z_2 - z_1}$
or:

$z = \paren {1 - t} z_1 + t z_2$

This form of $L$ is known as the parametric form, where $t$ is the parameter.


Proof
Let $z_1$ and $z_2$ be represented by the points $A = \tuple {x_1, y_1}$ and $B = \tuple {x_2, y_2}$ respectively in the complex plane.
Let $z$ be an arbitrary point on $L$ represented by the point $P$.




From Geometrical Interpretation of Complex Addition:














\(\ds OA + AP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds OP\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds z_1 + AP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds z\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds AP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds z - z_1\)
























\(\ds OA + AB\)

\(=\)







\(\ds OB\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds z_1 + AB\)

\(=\)







\(\ds z_2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds AB\)

\(=\)







\(\ds z_2 - z_1\)









As $AP$ and $AB$ are collinear:

$AP = t AB$
and so:

$z - z_1 = t \paren {z_2 - z_1}$
The given expressions follow after algebra.

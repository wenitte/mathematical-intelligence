Theorem
Let $n \in \Z_{\ge 0}$ be an integer.
Let $\struct {\Z / n \Z, +, \cdot}$ be the ring of integers modulo $n$.
Let $U = \struct {\paren {\Z / n \Z}^\times, \cdot}$ denote the group of units of $\struct {\Z / n \Z, +, \cdot}$.
Let $C_8$ denote the cyclic group of order $8$

Then:

$U$ and $C_8$ are not isomorphic.


Proof
Lemma
There are only $5$ numbers $n$ with the property that $\map \phi n = 8$, and they are $15$, $16$, $20$, $24$ and $30$.
$\Box$

Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $U$ and $C_8$ are isomorphic.

$\order U = \order {C_8} = 8$
From Order of Group of Units of Integers Modulo n we have that

$8 = \order U = \map \phi n$
where $\phi$ denotes the Euler $\phi$-function.

From the Lemma:

there are $5$ numbers $n$ with the property that $\map \phi n = 8$, and they are $15$, $16$, $20$, $24$ and $30$.

Therefore, no multiplicative group of integers mod $n$ is isomorphic to $C_8$.

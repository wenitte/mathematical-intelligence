Theorem
$\paren {S \setminus T} \cap T = \O$


Proof













\(\ds \paren {S \setminus T} \cap T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {S \cap T} \setminus T\)





Intersection with Set Difference is Set Difference with Intersection














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \O\)





Set Difference of Intersection with Set is Empty Set



$\blacksquare$

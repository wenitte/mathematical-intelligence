Theorem
The set of real numbers $\R$ forms a valued field under addition, multiplication and absolute value: $\struct {\R, +, \times, \size{\,\cdot\,}}$.


Proof
From Real Numbers form Field, we have that $\struct {\R, +, \times}$ forms a field.
From Absolute Value is Norm, we have that $\size{\size{\,\cdot\,}}$ is a norm on $\struct {\R, +, \times}$.
Hence $\struct {\R, +, \times, \size{\,\cdot\,}}$ is a valued field by definition.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
There exists at least one example of a connected topological space which is not a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space, which is also a scattered space.


Proof
Let $T$ be a divisor space.

From Divisor Space is Connected, $T$ is a connected space.
From Divisor Space is not $T_1$, $T$ is not a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.
From Divisor Space is Scattered, $T$ is a scattered space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

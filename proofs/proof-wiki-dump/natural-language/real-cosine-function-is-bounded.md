Theorem
Let $x \in \R$.

Then:

$\size {\cos x} \le 1$


Proof
From the algebraic definition of the real cosine function:

$\ds \cos x = \sum_{n \mathop = 0}^\infty \paren {-1}^n \frac {x^{2 n} } {\paren {2 n}!}$
it follows that $\cos x$ is a real function.
Similarly, $\sin x$ is also a real function.

Thus it follows that:














\(\ds \cos^2 x\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds \cos^2 x + \sin^2 x\)





as $\sin^2 x \ge 0$ by Square of Real Number is Non-Negative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)





Sum of Squares of Sine and Cosine




From Ordering of Squares in Reals and the definition of absolute value, we have that:

$x^2 \le 1 \iff \size x \le 1$
The result follows.

Theorem
The empty set is unique.


Proof
Let $\O$ and $\O'$ both be empty sets.
From Empty Set is Subset of All Sets, $\O \subseteq \O'$, because $\O$ is empty.
Likewise, we have $\O' \subseteq \O$, since $\O'$ is empty.
Together, by the definition of set equality, this implies that $\O = \O'$.

Thus there is only one empty set.
$\blacksquare$

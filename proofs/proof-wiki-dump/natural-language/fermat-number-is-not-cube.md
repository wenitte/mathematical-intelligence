Theorem
There exist no Fermat numbers which are cubes.


Proof 1
Direct consequence of Fermat Number is not Perfect Power.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Let $1 + 2^n$ be a Fermat number.
Suppose $a^3 = 1 + 2^n$.
Since $1 + 2^n$ is odd, $a$ must also be odd.
Write $a = 2 m + 1$, where $m > 0$.
Then:














\(\ds 1 + 2^n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2 m + 1}^3\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8 m^3 + 12 m^2 + 6 m + 1\)





Cube of Sum














\(\ds 2^n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8 m^3 + 12 m^2 + 6 m\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 m \paren {4 m^2 + 6 m + 3}\)









Since $4 m^2 + 6 m + 3$ is odd and greater than $1$, it is not a power of $2$.
Hence the equation $a^3 = 1 + 2^n$ has no solution in the integers.
Thus there are no Fermat numbers which are cubes.

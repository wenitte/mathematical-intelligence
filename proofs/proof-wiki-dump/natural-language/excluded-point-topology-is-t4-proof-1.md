Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_{\bar p} }$ be an excluded point space.

Then $T$ is a $T_4$ space.


Proof
We have that an Excluded Point Space is Ultraconnected.
That means none of its closed sets are disjount.
Hence, vacuously, any two of its disjoint closed subsets of $S$ are separated by neighborhoods.
The result follows by definition of $T_4$ space.
$\blacksquare$

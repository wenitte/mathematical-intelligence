Example of Use of Equation of Circle in Complex Plane
Let $C$ be a circle embedded in the complex plane whose radius is $4$ and whose center is $\paren {-2, 1}$.
Then $C$ can be described by the equation:

$\cmod {z + 2 - i} = 4$
or in conventional Cartesian coordinates:

$\paren {x + 2}^2 + \paren {y - 1}^2 = 16$


Proof
From Equation of Circle in Complex Plane, a circle whose radius is $r$ and whose center is $\alpha$ has equation:

$\cmod {z - \alpha} = r$




Substituting $\alpha = -2 + i$ and $r = 4$ gives:

$\cmod {z + 2 - i} = 4$
Letting $z = x + i y$ gives:














\(\ds \cmod {z + 2 - i}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4\)




















\(\ds \sqrt {\paren {x + 2}^2 + \paren {y - 1}^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4\)





Definition of Complex Modulus














\(\ds \paren {x + 2}^2 + \paren {y - 1}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16\)





squaring both sides



$\blacksquare$

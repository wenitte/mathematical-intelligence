Theorem
Let $S$ be a Gaussian stochastic process giving rise to a time series $T$.
Let $S$ be weakly stationary of order $2$.

Then $S$ is strictly stationary.


Proof
By definition of a Gaussian process, the probability distribution of $T$ be a multivariate normal distribution.
By definition, a normal distribution is characterized completely by its expectation and its variance.
That is, its $1$st and $2$nd moments.
The result follows.

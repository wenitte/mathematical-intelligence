Examples of Consecutive Pairs of Quadratic Residues
There are $7$ consecutive pairs of quadratic residues modulo $29$.
This is consistent with the number of such consecutive pairs being $\floor {\dfrac {29} 4}$.


Proof
From Quadratic Residues modulo $29$:

$\set {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28}$ are the quadratic residues modulo $29$
The set of pairs of consecutive quadratic residues modulo $29$ is therefore:

$\set {\set {4, 5}, \set {5, 6}, \set {6, 7}, \set {22, 23}, \set {23, 24}, \set {24, 25}, \set {28, 1} }$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $f: S \to T$ be a bijection.
Let:

$I_S$ be the identity mapping on $S$
$I_T$ be the identity mapping on $T$.
Let $f^{-1}$ be the inverse of $f$.

Then:

$f^{-1} \circ f = I_S$
and:

$f \circ f^{-1} = I_T$
where $\circ$ denotes composition of mappings.


Proof
Let $f$ be a bijection.
By definition, $f$ is a mapping, and hence also by definition a relation.
Hence the result Bijective Relation has Left and Right Inverse applies directly and so:

$f^{-1} \circ f = I_S$
and

$f \circ f^{-1} = I_T$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $RÂ := \struct {\set {\text{even}, \text{odd} }, +, \times}$ be the parity ring.

The operation $+$ is commutative:

$\forall a, b \in R: a + b = b + a$


Proof
From Isomorphism between Ring of Integers Modulo 2 and Parity Ring:

$\struct {\set {\text{even}, \text{odd} }, +, \times}$ is isomorphic with $\struct {\Z_2, +_2, \times_2}$
the ring of integers modulo $2$.

The result follows from:

Modulo Addition is Commutative
and:

Isomorphism Preserves Commutativity.

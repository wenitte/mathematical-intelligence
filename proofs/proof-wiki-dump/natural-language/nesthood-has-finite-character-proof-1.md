Theorem
Let $P$ be the property of sets defined as:

$\forall x: \map P x$ denotes that $x$ is a nest.
Then $P$ is of finite character.
That is:

$x$ is a nest
if and only if:

every finite subset of $x$ is a nest.


Proof
By definition, a nest $N$ is a class on which $\subseteq$ is a total ordering.
Here we are given that $N$ is a set.
The result follows from Property of being Totally Ordered is of Finite Character.

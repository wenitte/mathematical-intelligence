Theorem
Let $\struct {\Q, \tau_d}$ be the rational number space under the Euclidean topology $\tau_d$.

Then $\struct {\Q, \tau_d}$ is not weakly $\sigma$-locally compact.


Proof
From Rational Number Space is not Locally Compact Hausdorff Space, $\struct {\Q, \tau_d}$ is not weakly locally compact.
Hence the result from definition of weakly $\sigma$-locally compact.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\map E x$ be the equation in $x$ represented as:

$\ds \sum_{j \mathop = 0}^n a_j x^j = 0$
where the $a_j$s are constants.

Then $x$ is a root of $\map E x$ if and only if:

$\ds \sum_{j \mathop = 0}^n a_j = 0$
That is, $x$ is a root of $\map E x$ if and only if all the coefficients of the polynomial in $x$ sum to zero.


Proof
Letting $x = 1$ in $E$;

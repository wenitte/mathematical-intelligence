Theorem
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number.
Let $\ceiling x$ denote the ceiling of $x$.

Then:

$\ceiling {\ceiling x} = \ceiling x$

That is, the ceiling function is idempotent.


Proof
Let $y = \ceiling x$.
By Ceiling Function is Integer, $y$ is an integer.
Then from Real Number is Integer iff equals Ceiling:

$\ceiling y = y$
So:

$\ceiling {\ceiling x} = \ceiling x$
$\blacksquare$

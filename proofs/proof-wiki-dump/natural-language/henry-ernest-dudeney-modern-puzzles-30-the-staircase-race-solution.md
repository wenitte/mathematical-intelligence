The Staircase Race
This is a rough sketch of a race up a staircase in which $3$ men took part.
Ackworth, who is leading, went up $3$ risers at a time, as arranged;
Barnden, the second man, went $4$ risers at a time,
and Croft, who is last, went $5$ at a time.

Undoubtedly Ackworth wins.
But the point is,
How many risers are there in the stairs, counting the top landing as a riser?


Solution
There are $19$ risers.


Proof
We refer to Ackworth, Barnden and Croft as $A$, $B$ and $C$.
Let $N$ be the number of risers.
The diagram shows that:

$A$ has $1$ odd step at the top
$B$ will have $3$ such odd steps
$C$ will have $4$ such steps.
Thus we have:

$N \equiv 1 \pmod 3$
$N \equiv 3 \pmod 4$
$N \equiv 4 \pmod 5$

Notice that:

$N + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod 4$
$N + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod 5$
so $N + 1$ must be a multiple of $20$.
The smallest such $N$ is $19$, and we see that it satisfies the first condition as well.
$\blacksquare$

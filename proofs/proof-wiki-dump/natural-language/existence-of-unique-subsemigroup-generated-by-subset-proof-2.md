Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a semigroup.
Let $\O \subset X \subseteq S$.
Let $\struct {T, \circ}$ be the subsemigroup generated by $X$.
Then $T = \gen X$ exists and is unique.


Proof
Let $\mathbb S$ be the set of all subsemigroups of $S$.
From Set of Subsemigroups forms Complete Lattice:

$\struct {\mathbb S, \subseteq}$ is a complete lattice.
where for every set $\mathbb H$ of subsemigroups of $S$:

the infimum of $\mathbb H$ necessarily admitted by $\mathbb H$ is $\ds \bigcap \mathbb H$.
Hence the result, by definition of infimum.
$\blacksquare$

Classic Problem
$8$ trees are to be planted in an orchard so as to make the number of rows of $3$ trees the largest number possible.
That is:
$8$ points are to be configured in the plane so that the number of straight lines that can be drawn through exactly $3$ of these points is maximised.


Solution

The number of rows is $7$.
$\blacksquare$

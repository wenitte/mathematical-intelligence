Theorem
Let $\struct {\mathbb K, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a valued field.
Let the infinite product $\ds \prod_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty \paren {1 + a_n}$ be absolutely convergent.

Then:

$a_n \to 0$


Proof
We have that $\ds \prod_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty \paren {1 + a_n}$ is absolutely convergent.
Let $b_n = \paren {1 + a_n}$
Then $\ds \prod_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty b_n$ is absolutely convergent.
From Absolutely Convergent Product is Convergent, $\ds \prod_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty b_n$ is convergent.
By Factors in Convergent Product Converge to One:

$b_n \to 1$
Thus:

$a_n \to 0$
$\blacksquare$

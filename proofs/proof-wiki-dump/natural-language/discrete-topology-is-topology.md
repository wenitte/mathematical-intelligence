Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\tau$ be the discrete topology on $S$.

$\tau$ is a topology on $S$.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be the discrete space on $S$.
Then by definition $\tau = \powerset S$, that is, is the power set of $S$.
We confirm the criteria for $T$ to be a topology:

$(1): \quad$ By definition of power set, $\O \in \powerset S$ and $S \in \powerset S$.
$(2): \quad$ From Power Set with Union is Monoid, $\powerset S$ is closed under set union.
$(3): \quad$ From Power Set with Intersection is Monoid, $\powerset S$ is closed under set intersection.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $x, y \in S$.

Then:

$x \preceq y$ if and only if $x = \map \inf {x, y}$
where $\map \inf {x, y}$ is the infimum of $x$ and $y$

Proof
This is the dual statement of Successor is Supremum by Dual Pairs (Order Theory).
The result follows from the Duality Principle.
$\blacksquare$

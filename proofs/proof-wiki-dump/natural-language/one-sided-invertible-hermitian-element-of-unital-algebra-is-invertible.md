Theorem
Let $\tuple {A, \ast}$ be a unital $\ast$-algebra over $\C$. 
Let $a \in A$ be Hermitian such that either:

$a b = {\mathbf 1}_A$ for some $b \in A$
or:

$b a = {\mathbf 1}_A$ for some $b \in A$.

Then $a$ is invertible with inverse $b$. 
Further, $b$ is Hermitian.


Proof
Suppose first that:

$a b = {\mathbf 1}_A$ for some $b \in A$.
From the definition of an involution and Identity Element in Unital *-Algebra is Hermitian, we have:

$b^\ast a = {\mathbf 1}_A$
For Left Inverse and Right Inverse is Inverse, we have that:

$a$ is invertible with inverse $b$.
Further Left Inverse and Right Inverse is Inverse prescribes uniqueness and so:

$b = b^\ast$
So $b$ is Hermitian.

Suppose now that:

$b a = {\mathbf 1}_A$ for some $b \in A$.
From the definition of an involution and Identity Element in Unital *-Algebra is Hermitian, we have:

$a b^\ast = {\mathbf 1}_A$
For Left Inverse and Right Inverse is Inverse, we again have that:

$a$ is invertible with inverse $b$ with $b$ Hermitian.

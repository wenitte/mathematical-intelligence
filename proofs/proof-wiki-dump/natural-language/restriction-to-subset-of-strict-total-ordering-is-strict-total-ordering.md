Theorem
Let $S$ be a set or class.
Let $\prec$ be a strict total ordering on $A$.
Let $T$ be a subset or subclass of $A$.

Then the restriction of $\prec$ to $B$ is a strict total ordering of $B$.


Proof
Follows from:

Restriction of Transitive Relation is Transitive
Restriction of Antireflexive Relation is Antireflexive
Restriction of Connected Relation is Connected
$\blacksquare$

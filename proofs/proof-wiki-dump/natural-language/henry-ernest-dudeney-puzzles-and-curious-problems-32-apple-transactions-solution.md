Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $32$
Apple Transactions
A man was asked what price per $100$ he paid for some apples, and his reply was as follows:
"If they had been $4 \oldpence$ more per $100$ I should have got $5$ less for $10 \shillings$"
Can you say what was the price per $100$?


Solution
$8 \shillings$


Proof
Let $p$ be the price per apple in pence.
Let $n$ be the number of apples that were bought for $10 \shillings$, that is, $120 \oldpence$
Then we have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {120} p\)





the number of apples that can be bought for $120 \oldpence$




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \paren {p + \dfrac 4 {100} } \paren {n - 5}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 120\)





"If they had been $4 \oldpence$ more per $100$ I should have got $5$ less for $10 \shillings$"








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {p + \dfrac 4 {100} } \paren {\dfrac {120} p - 5}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 120\)





substituting for $n$ in $(2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {\dfrac {100 p + 4} {100} } \paren {\dfrac {120 - 5 p} p}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 120\)





common denominators








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {100 p + 4} \paren {120 - 5 p}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 120 \times 100 p\)





multiplying through by $100 p$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 100 \times 120 p + 4 \times 120 - 500 p^2 - 20 p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 120 \times 100 p\)





multiplying out








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 25 p^2 + p - 24\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {-1 \pm \sqrt {1^2 + 4 \times 25 \times 24} } {2 \times 25}\)





Quadratic Formula








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {-1 \pm 49} {50}\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {96} {100} \text { or } -1\)





simplifying



Only the positive root is appropriate here.
Hence:

$p = \dfrac {96} {100}$
That is, the price for $100$ apples is $96 \oldpence$, which works out as $\dfrac {96} {12} = 8 \shillings$
$\blacksquare$

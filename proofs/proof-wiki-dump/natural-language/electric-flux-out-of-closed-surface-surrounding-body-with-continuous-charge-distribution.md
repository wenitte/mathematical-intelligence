Theorem
Let $B$ be a body of matter which has a continuous macroscopic charge density $\map \rho {\mathbf r}$.
Let $S$ be a closed surface surrounding $Q$.
The total electric flux through $S$ generated by the electric charge on $B$ is given by:

$\ds F = \dfrac 1 {\varepsilon_0} \int_V \map \rho {\mathbf r} \rd \tau$
where:

$V$ is the total volume enclosed by $S$
$\d \tau$ is an infinitesimal volume element
$\mathbf r$ is the position vector of $\d \tau$
$\map \rho {\mathbf r}$ is the macroscopic charge density of the macroscopic electric field at $\mathbf r$
$\varepsilon_0$ denotes the vacuum permittivity.


Proof
Let $\d \tau$ be an arbitrary infinitesimal volume element.
$\d \tau$ can be considered as an infinitesimal point charge $\d q$.

From Electric Flux out of Closed Surface surrounding Point Charge:

$\d F_\tau = \dfrac {\d q} {\varepsilon_0}$
where $\d F_\tau$ is the infinitesimal part of $F$ brought about by $\d q$. 
By definition of macroscopic charge density:

$\map \rho {\mathbf r} = \dfrac {\d q} {\d \tau}$
Hence:

$\d F_\tau = \dfrac {\map \rho {\mathbf r} \rd \tau} {\varepsilon_0}$

Integrating over all space:

$\ds F = \dfrac 1 {\varepsilon_0} \int_V \map \rho {\mathbf r} \rd \tau$
$\blacksquare$

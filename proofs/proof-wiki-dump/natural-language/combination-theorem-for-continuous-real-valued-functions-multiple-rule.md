Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $f :S \to \R$ be contiuous real-valued function.
Let $\lambda \in \R$.
Let $\lambda f : S \to \R$ be the pointwise scalar multiplication of $f$ by $\lambda$, that is, $\lambda f$ is the mappping defined by:

$\forall s \in S : \map {\paren{\lambda f} } s = \lambda \map f s$

Then:

$\lambda f$ is a continuous real-valued function


Proof
Follows from:

Real Numbers form Valued Field
By definition a valued field is a normed division ring
Multiple Rule for Continuous Mappings into Normed Division Ring
$\blacksquare$

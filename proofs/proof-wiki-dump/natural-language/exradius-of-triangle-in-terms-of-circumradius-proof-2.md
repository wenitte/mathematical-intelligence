Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle whose sides are $a$, $b$ and $c$ opposite vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively.
Let $\rho_a$ be the exradius of $\triangle ABC$ with respect to $a$.
Let $R$ be the circumradius of $\triangle ABC$.

Then:

$\rho_a = 4 R \sin \dfrac A 2 \cos \dfrac B 2 \cos \dfrac C 2$


Proof

Let $r$ denote the inradius of $\triangle ABC$.
We have:














\(\ds r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 R \sin \dfrac A 2 \sin \dfrac B 2 \sin \dfrac C 2\)





Inradius in Terms of Circumradius








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \rho_a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 R \sin \dfrac A 2 \map \sin {\dfrac {180 \degrees - B} 2} \map \sin {\dfrac {180 \degrees - C} 2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 R \sin \dfrac A 2 \map \sin {90 \degrees - \dfrac B 2} \map \sin {90 \degrees - \dfrac C 2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 R \sin \dfrac A 2 \cos \dfrac B 2 \cos \dfrac C 2\)





Sine of Complement equals Cosine




This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Why the second line? From the book it says "It should be noted that this formula can be deduced from Inradius in Terms of Circumradius by writing $\paren {180 \degrees - B}$ for $B$ and $\paren {180 \degrees - C}$ for $C$" but plenty of work is needed to show why this is valid.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.

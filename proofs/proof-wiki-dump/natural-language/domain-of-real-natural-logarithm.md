Theorem
Let $\ln$ be the natural logarithm function on the real numbers.

Then the domain of $\ln$ is the set of strictly positive real numbers:

$\Dom \ln = \R_{>0}$


Proof
By definition of natural logarithm:

$\ln^{-1} = \exp$
From Exponential Tends to Zero and Infinity:

$\Dom \exp = \openint {-\infty} {+\infty}$
$\Img \exp = \openint 0 {+\infty}$
From Exponential is Strictly Increasing:

$\exp$ is strictly increasing.
From Strictly Monotone Real Function is Bijective, $\exp: \R \to \R_{>0}$ is a bijection.
Thus:

$\Dom \ln = \Img \exp$
and so $\Dom \ln = \R_{>0}$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $K$ be a hyperbola such that:

the transverse axis of $K$ has length $2 a$
the conjugate axis of $K$ has length $2 b$.

Let $K$ be aligned in a cartesian plane in reduced form.

$K$ can be expressed by the equation:

$\dfrac {x^2} {a^2} - \dfrac {y^2} {b^2} = 1$


Proof
Â 



By definition, the foci $F_1$ and $F_2$ of $K$ are located at $\tuple {-c, 0}$ and $\tuple {c, 0}$ respectively.
Let the vertices of $K$ be $V_1$ and $V_2$.
By definition, these are located at $\tuple {-a, 0}$ and $\tuple {a, 0}$.
Let the covertices of $K$ be $C_1$ and $C_2$.
By definition, these are located at $\tuple {0, -b}$ and $\tuple {0, b}$.

Let $P = \tuple {x, y}$ be an arbitrary point on the locus of $K$.

From the equidistance property of $K$ we have that:

$\size {F_1 P - F_2 P} = d$
where $d$ is a constant for this particular ellipse.
From Equidistance of Hyperbola equals Transverse Axis:

$d = 2 a$
Also, from Focus of Hyperbola from Transverse and Conjugate Axis:

$c^2 a^2 = b^2$
Without loss of generality, let us choose a point $P$ such that $F_1 P > F_2 P$.
Then:

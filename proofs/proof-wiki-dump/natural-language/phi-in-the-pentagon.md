Theorem
Let $ABCDE$ be a regular pentagon.
The chords and sides of $ABCDE$ form three kinds of similar triangles.

I: Isosceles, similar to $\triangle ACD$.
II: Isosceles, similar to $\triangle ABE$.
The sides of the first type are in the ratio $\phi : 1$, where $\phi$ is the golden mean.
The sides of the second type are in the ratio $1 : \phi$.


In the words of Euclid:

If in an equilateral and equiangular pentagon straight lines subtend two internal angles taken in order, they cut one another in extreme and mean ratio, and their greater segments are equal to the side of the pentagon.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XIII}$: Proposition $8$)



Proof
by hypothesis five sides of $ABCDE$ are equal.
Draw all five chords.
From symmetry, the chords are all equal.
$\leadsto$:

$\triangle ACD$ is an isosceles triangle.

Let the length of $D'C' = B'C' = 1$.
Let the length of $EB' = AD' = AC' = \phi$, where $\phi$ is to be determined.

\(\ds 0\)









By the quadratic equation:

$\phi = \dfrac{ 1 \pm \sqrt{5} } 2$
We take $\phi > 0$ so:

$\phi = \dfrac{ 1 + \sqrt{5} } 2$
By definition of golden mean:

$\phi$ is the golden mean

The length of the sides of the pentagon is $\phi + 1$.
By Equiangular Triangles are Similar:

$\triangle ADE \sim \triangle B'ED$
$\leadsto$:

$\dfrac {\phi + 1} { 2 \phi + 1 } = \dfrac {\phi} {\phi + 1}$
Working with the right hand side and substituting from above:

$\dfrac {\phi} {\phi + 1} = \dfrac {\phi} {\phi^2}$
$= \dfrac 1 \phi$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

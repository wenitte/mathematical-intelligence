Theorem
The closed-form expression for the $n$th triangular number is:

$\ds T_n = \sum_{i \mathop = 1}^n i = \frac {n \paren {n + 1} } 2$


Proof
Triangular numbers are $k$-gonal numbers where $k = 3$.
From Closed Form for Polygonal Numbers we have that:

$P \left({k, n}\right) = \dfrac n 2 \left({\left({k - 2}\right) n - k + 4}\right)$

Hence:














\(\ds T_n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac n 2 \left({\left({3 - 2}\right) n - 3 + 4}\right)\)





Closed Form for Polygonal Numbers














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac n 2 \left({n + 1}\right)\)









Hence the result.

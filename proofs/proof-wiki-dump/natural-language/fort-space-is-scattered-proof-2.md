Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a Fort space on an infinite set $S$.

Then $T$ is a scattered space.


Proof
Suppose that $H \subseteq T$ has no isolated points of $H$.
So, by definition, $H$ is dense in itself.
We have that:

a Fort Space is $T_1$
a Dense-in-itself Subset of $T_1$ Space is Infinite.
So $H$ is infinite, and so contains more than one point.
So $\exists q \in H: q \ne p$.
But, from Clopen Points in Fort Space, $\set q$ is open in $T$.
So $H \cap \set q = \set q$ and so by definition $q$ is isolated in $H$.
From this contradiction it follows that $H$ is not dense in itself and contains at least one isolated point.
Hence the result, by definition of scattered space.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

Incommensurable magnitudes have not to one another the ratio which a number has to a number.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $7$)


Proof
Let $A$ and $B$ be incommensurable magnitudes.
Suppose $A$ and $B$ have the ratio which a number has to a number
Then by Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{X} $: Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable, $A$ and $B$ are commensurable.
From this contradiction follows the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $7$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Theorem
Let $A$ and $B$ be commutative rings with unity.
Let $fÂ : A \to B$ be a ring homomorphism.
Let $\mathfrak b$ be an ideal of $B$.
Let ${\mathfrak b}^c$ be the contraction of $\mathfrak b$ by $f$.
Let ${\mathfrak b}^{ce}$ be the extension of ${\mathfrak b}^c$ by $f$.
Let ${\mathfrak b}^{cec}$ be the contraction of ${\mathfrak b}^{ce}$ by $f$.

Then:

${\mathfrak b}^c = {\mathfrak b}^{cec}$


Proof
Since $\mathfrak b \supseteq {\mathfrak b}^{ce}$ by Ideal Contains Extension of Contraction:














\(\ds {\mathfrak b}^c\)

\(\supseteq\)







\(\ds \paren { {\mathfrak b}^{ce} }^c\)





Contraction of Ideals Preserves Inclusion Order














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds {\mathfrak b}^{cec}\)





Composition of Mappings is Associative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren { {\mathfrak b}^c}^{ec}\)





Composition of Mappings is Associative














\(\ds \)

\(\supseteq\)







\(\ds {\mathfrak b}^c\)





Ideal is Contained in Contraction of Extension

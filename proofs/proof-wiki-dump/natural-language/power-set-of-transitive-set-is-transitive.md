Theorem
Let $x$ be a transitive set.

Then its power set $\powerset x$ is also a transitive set.


Proof
Let $x$ be transitive.
By Set is Transitive iff Subset of Power Set:

$x \subseteq \powerset x$
Then by Power Set of Subset:

$\powerset x \subseteq \powerset {\powerset x}$
Thus by Set is Transitive iff Subset of Power Set:

$\powerset x$ is a transitive set.
$\blacksquare$

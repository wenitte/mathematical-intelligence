Theorem
Let $S$ and $T$ be sets.
Let $f: S \to T$ be a mapping.
Let the inverse $f^{-1} \subseteq T \times S$ itself be a mapping.

Then $f$ is an injection.


Proof
Let $f^{-1}: T \to S$ be a mapping.














\(\ds \map f x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f y\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {f^{-1} } {\map f x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {f^{-1} } {\map f y}\)





as $f^{-1}$ is a mapping








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y\)





Definition 1 of Inverse Mapping: as $\map {f^{-1} } {\map f x}$ and so on



Thus $f$ is by definition an injection.
$\blacksquare$

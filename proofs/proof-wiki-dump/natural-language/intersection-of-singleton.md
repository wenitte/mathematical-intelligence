Theorem
Consider the set of sets $A$ such that $A$ consists of just one set $x$:

$A = \set x$

Then the intersection of $A$ is $x$:

$\bigcap A = x$


Proof
Let $A = \set x$.
Then from the definition:

$\bigcap \set x = \set {y: \forall z \in \set x: y \in z}$
from which it follows directly:

$\bigcap \set x = \set {y: y \in x}$
as $x$ is the only set in $\set x$.
That is:

$\bigcap A = x$
$\blacksquare$

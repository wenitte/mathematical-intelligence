Theorem
Let $T = \struct {\CC, \tau_d}$ be the Cantor space.

Then $T$ is a complete metric space.


Proof
We have that the Cantor space is a metric subspace of the real number space $\R$, and hence a metric space.
We also have Cantor Space is Compact.
The result follows from Compact Metric Space is Complete.

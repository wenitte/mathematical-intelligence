Theorem
Let:

$\struct {G_1, \odot}$
$\struct {G_2, *}$
$\struct {G_3, \oplus}$
be groups.
Let:

$\phi: \struct {G_1, \odot} \to \struct {G_2, *}$
$\psi: \struct {G_2, *} \to \struct {G_3, \oplus}$
be (group) epimorphisms.

Then the composite of $\phi$ and $\psi$ is also a (group) epimorphism.


Proof
A group epimorphism is a group homomorphism which is also a surection.

From Composite of Group Homomorphisms is Homomorphism, $\psi \circ \phi$ is a group homomorphism.
From Composite of Surjections is Surjection, $\psi \circ \phi$ is a surection.
$\blacksquare$

This article is complete as far as it goes, but it could do with expansion.In particular: with a diagram, etc.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by adding this information.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Expand}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Proof













\(\ds \int_0^\pi \sin x \rd x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \bigintlimits {-\cos x} 0 \pi\)





Primitive of Sine Function














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)





Cosine of $\pi$, Cosine of $0 \degrees$



$\blacksquare$

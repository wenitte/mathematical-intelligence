Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
Nicarete, playing with five companions of her own age,
gave a third of the nuts she had to Cleis,
the quarter to Sappho,
and the fifth to Aristodice,
the twentieth and again the twelfth to Theano,
and the twenty-fourth to Philinnis.
Fifty nuts were left for herself.


Solution
Let $n$ be the number of nuts in total.

$\dfrac n 3$ went to Cleis
$\dfrac n 4$ went to Sappho
$\dfrac n 5$ went to Aristodice
$\dfrac n {20} + \dfrac n {12}$ went to Theano
$\dfrac n {24}$ went to Philinnis
$50$ stayed with Nicarete.

We have:














\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac n 3 + \dfrac n 4 + \dfrac n 5 + \dfrac n {20} + \dfrac n {12} + \dfrac n {24} + 50\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 120 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40 n + 30 n + 24 n + 6 n + 10 n + 5 n + 120 \times 50\)





multiplying through by $120 = \lcm \set {3, 4, 5, 20, 12, 24}$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {120 - 40 - 30 - 24 - 6 - 10 - 5} n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 120 \times 50\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 120 \times 50\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {120 \times 50} {10}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1200\)










So there were $1200$ nuts.

$400$ went to Cleis
$300$ went to Sappho
$240$ went to Aristodice
$60 + 100 = 160$ went to Theano
$50$ went to Philinnis
and we know that Nicarete kept $50$.
$\blacksquare$

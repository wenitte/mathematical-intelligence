Theorem
Let $E$ be an ellipse whose major axis is equal to its minor axis.
Then $E$ is a circle.


Proof
Let $E$ be embedded in a Cartesian plane in reduced form.
Then from Equation of Ellipse in Reduced Form $E$ can be expressed using the equation:

$\dfrac {x^2} {a^2} + \dfrac {y^2} {b^2} = 1$
where the major axis and minor axis are $a$ and $b$ respectively.
Let $a = b$.
Then:














\(\ds \dfrac {x^2} {a^2} + \dfrac {y^2} {a^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 + y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2\)









which by Equation of Circle center Origin is the equation of a circle whose radius is $a$.

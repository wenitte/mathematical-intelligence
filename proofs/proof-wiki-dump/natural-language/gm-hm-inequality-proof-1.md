Theorem
Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \in \R_{> 0}$ be strictly positive real numbers.
Let $G_n$ be the geometric mean of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$.
Let $H_n$ be the harmonic mean of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$.

Then:

$G_n \ge H_n$


Proof
Let ${G_n}'$ denotes the geometric mean of the reciprocals of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$.

By definition of harmonic mean, we have that:

$\ds \dfrac 1 {H_n}Â := \frac 1 n \paren {\sum_{k \mathop = 1}^n \frac 1 {x_k} }$
That is, $\dfrac 1 {H_n}$ is the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$.

Then:














\(\ds \dfrac 1 {H_n}\)

Theorem
Let $a, b, c, d, e \in Z$ be consecutive integers
Then their product $a b c d e$ is divisible by $120$.


Proof
This is an application of Divisibility of Product of Consecutive Integers with $n = 5$.
By the theorem, the product of $5$ consecutive integers is divisible by $5! = 120$.
$\blacksquare$

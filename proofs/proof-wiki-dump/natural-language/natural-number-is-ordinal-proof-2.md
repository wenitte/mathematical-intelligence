Theorem
Let $n \in \N$ be a natural number.
Then $n$ is an ordinal.


Proof
From the von Neumann construction of the natural numbers, $\N$ is identified with the minimally inductive set $\omega$.
From Superinductive Class under Successor Mapping contains All Ordinals, it follows by the Principle of Mathematical Induction that every natural number is an ordinal.

Theorem
There exists at least one example of a compact $T_2$ (Hausdorff) space which is not a $T_5$ space.


Proof
Let $T$ be the Tychonoff plank.

From Tychonoff Plank is Compact, $T$ is a compact topological space.
From Tychonoff Plank is Hausdorff, $T$ is a $T_2$ (Hausdorff) space.
From Tychonoff Plank is not Completely Normal, $T$ is not a completely normal space.
From $T_2$ Space is $T_1$ Space, $T$ is also a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.
As $T$ is a $T_1$ space, it follows by definition of completely normal space that $T$ is not a $T_5$ space.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a commutative monoid.
Let $\struct {C, \circ} \subseteq \struct {S, \circ}$ be the subsemigroup of cancellable elements of $\struct {S, \circ}$.
Let $\struct {T, \circ'}$ be an inverse completion of $\struct {S, \circ}$.

Then the inverse of an element of $S$ which is invertible for $\circ$ is also its inverse for $\circ'$.


Proof
Let the identity of $\struct {S, \circ}$ be $e$.
Let $z$ be the inverse of $y$ for $\circ$:

$z \circ y = e$
$y \circ z = e$
From Identity of Inverse Completion of Commutative Monoid:

$z \circ' y = e$
$y \circ' z = e$
Hence $z$ is the inverse of $y$ for $\circ'$.
$\blacksquare$

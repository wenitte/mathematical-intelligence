Example of Euler Lucky Number
The expression:

$n^2 + n + 3$
yields primes for $n = 0$ to $n = 1$.

This demonstrates that $3$ is (more or less trivially) a Euler lucky number.


Proof













\(\ds 0^2 + 0 + 3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0 + 0 + 3\)

\(\ds = 3\)



which is prime














\(\ds 1^2 + 1 + 3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 + 1 + 3\)

\(\ds = 5\)



which is prime



$\blacksquare$

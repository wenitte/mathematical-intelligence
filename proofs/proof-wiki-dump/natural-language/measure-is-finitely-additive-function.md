Theorem
Let $\Sigma$ be a $\sigma$-algebra on a set $X$.
Let $\mu: \Sigma \to \overline {\R}$ be a measure on $\Sigma$.

Then $\mu$ is finitely additive.


Proof
From the definition of a measure, $\mu$ is countably additive.
From Countably Additive Function also Finitely Additive, $\mu$ is finitely additive.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Problem from Chiu Chang Suann Jing
There is a bamboo $10$ feet high,
the upper end of which being broken down on reaching the ground,
the tip is just $3$ feet from the stem;
what is the height of the break?


Solution
The height of the break is $4 \tfrac {11} {20}$ feet.


Proof
Let the height of the break be $x$ feet.
The length of the broken section is then $10 - x$ feet.
The broken section forms the hypotenuse  of a right triangle.
One of the legs of that right triangle is the remaining stalk of bamboo, which is $x$ feet long.
The other leg is the distance of the end of the tip from the stalk, which is $3$ feet.
Hence:














\(\ds \paren {10 - x}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x^2 + 3^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 20 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100 - 9\)





simplification








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {91} {20}\)





simplification














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \tfrac {11} {20}\)





simplification



$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This problem was also presented by Brahmagupta in one of his works, but it has not been identified where this appears.

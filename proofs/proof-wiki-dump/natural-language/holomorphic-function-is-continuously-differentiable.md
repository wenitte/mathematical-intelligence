Theorem
Let $U \subseteq \C$ be an open set.
Let $f : U \to \C$ be a holomorphic function.

Then $f$ is continuously differentiable in $U$.


Proof
Let $z \in U$.
The derivatives $\map {f'} z$ and $\map {f} z$ exist by Cauchy's Integral Formula for Derivatives.
Therefore $f'$ is continuous at $z$ by Complex-Differentiable Function is Continuous.

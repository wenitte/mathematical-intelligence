Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $G$ be a group with identity $e$ whose order is $p$.

Then $G$ has $p - 1$ elements of order $p$.


Proof
Let $\order g$ denote the order of an element $g$ of $G$.
From Order of Element Divides Order of Finite Group:

$\order g \divides p$
where $\divides$ denotes divisibility.
By definition of prime number, the only divisors of $p$ are $1$ and $p$.
From Identity is Only Group Element of Order 1, only $e$ has order $1$ in $G$.
That leaves $p - 1$ elements of order $p$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
There exists at least one example of a weakly countably compact topological space which is not also a countably compact space.


Proof
Let $T$ be the deleted integer topological space.

From Deleted Integer Topology is Weakly Countably Compact, $T$ is a weakly countably compact space.
From Deleted Integer Topology is not Countably Compact, $T$ is not a countably compact space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

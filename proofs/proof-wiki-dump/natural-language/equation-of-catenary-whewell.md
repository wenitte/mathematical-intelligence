Theorem
The catenary can be described by the Whewell equation:

$s = a \tan \psi$
where:

$s$ is the arc length
$\psi$ is the turning angle
$a$ is a constant.


Proof
By definition, the catenary is the shape made by an ideally flexible chain hanging freely from two arbitrary points.

Let the catenary $\CC$ lie in a Cartesian plane.
Let the lowest point on $\CC$ be $P_0$.
Let $P$ be an arbitrary point on the chain.
Let $s$ be the length along the arc of the chain from the $P_0$ to $P$.
Let $w$ be the linear mass density of the chain, that is, its weight per unit length.
The section of chain between the lowest point and $P$ is in static equilibrium under the influence of three forces, as follows:

The tension $T_0$ at $P_0$
The tension $T$ at $P$
The weight $w s$ of the chain between these two points.
As the chain is (ideally) flexible, the tension $T$ is along the line of the chain, and therefore along a tangent to the chain.
At $P_0$, the tangent to $\CC$ is a horizontal line.
Let the angle between the tangent to $\CC$ at $P$ and that (horizontal) tangent to $\CC$ at $P_0$ be $\psi$.
By definition, $\psi$ is the turning angle of $\CC$.


This article contains statements that are justified by handwavery.In particular: I believe a mathematical justification of this statement is incomplete. Needs attention and consideration as to exactly what "turning angle" is. We are trying to capture the idea that it's the rate of change of angle with respect to distance travelled. Hence this argument needs more careful thought.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by adding precise reasons why such statements hold.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Handwaving}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.




Let us resolve $T$ into its horizontal and vertical components:

$T_0 = T \cos \psi$
$w s = T \sin \psi$
We divide one by the other to eliminate $T$ and set $a = T_0 / w$:

$\tan \psi = \dfrac s a$
from which the result follows.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The problem of determining the shape of the catenary was posed in $1690$ by Jacob Bernoulli as a challenge.
It had been thought by Galileo to be a parabola.
Huygens showed in $1646$ by physical considerations that it could not be so, but he failed to establish its exact nature.

In $1691$, Leibniz, Huygens and Johann Bernoulli all independently published solutions.
It was Leibniz who gave it the name catenary.

From a letter that Johann Bernoulli wrote in $1718$:

The efforts of my brother were without success. For my part, I was more fortunate, for I found the skill (I say it without boasting; why should I conceal the  truth?) to solve it in full ... It is true that it cost me study that robbed me of rest for an entire night. It was a great achievement for those days and for the slight age and experience I then had. The next morning, filled with joy, I ran to my brother, who was still struggling miserably with this Gordian knot without getting anywhere, always thinking like Galileo that the catenary was a parabola. Stop! Stop! I say to him, don't torture yourself any more trying to prove the identity of the catenary with the parabola, since it is entirely false.

However, Jacob Bernoulli was first to demonstrate that of all possible shapes, the catenary has the lowest center of gravity, and hence the smallest potential energy.
This discovery was significant.


Lingustic Note
The word catenary comes from the Latin word catena meaning chain.

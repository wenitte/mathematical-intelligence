Theorem
Parallelism between straight lines is a transitive relation.

In the words of Euclid:

Straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one other.
(The Elements: Book $\text{I}$: Proposition $30$)


Proof


Let the straight lines $AB$ and $CD$ both be parallel to the straight line $EF$.
Let the straight line $GK$ be a transversal that cuts the parallel lines $AB$ and $EF$.
By Parallelism implies Equal Alternate Angles:

$\angle AGK = \angle GHF$
By Playfair's Axiom, there is only one line that passes through $H$ that is parallel to $CD$ (namely $EF$).
Therefore the transversal $GK$ cannot be parallel to $CD$.
Hence the two lines must therefore intersect.
The straight line $GK$ also cuts the parallel lines $EF$ and $CD$.
So from Parallelism implies Equal Corresponding Angles:

$\angle GHF = \angle GKD$.
Thus $\angle AGK = \angle GKD$.
So from Equal Alternate Angles implies Parallel Lines:

$AB \parallel CD$
$\blacksquare$

Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $30$ of Book $\text{I}$ of Euclid's The Elements. Note that while this result applies to all parallel lines in Euclidean geometry, this proof is only valid when all three lines are in the same plane.

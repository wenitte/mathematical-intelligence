Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $\struct {\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ be the ring of continuous real-valued functions from $S$.
Let $f \in \map C {S, \R}$.

Then:

the additive inverse of $f$ is the pointwise negation $-f$ defined by:
$\forall s \in S : \map {-f} s = - \map f s$


Proof
By definition of ring of continuous real-valued functions:

$\struct {\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ is the ring of continuous mappings from $S$ to $\R$.
From Additive Inverse in Ring of Continuous Mappings:

$\forall f \in \map C {S, \R} :$ the additive inverse of $f$ is the pointwise negation $-f$, defined by:
$\forall s \in S: \map {\paren {-f} } s := - \map f s$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

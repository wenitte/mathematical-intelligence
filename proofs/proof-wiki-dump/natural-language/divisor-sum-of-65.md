Example of Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime
$\map {\sigma_1} {65} = 84$
where $\sigma_1$ denotes the divisor sum function.


Proof
We have that:

$65 = 5 \times 13$
and so by definition is a semiprime whose prime factors are distinct.

Hence:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {65}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {5 + 1} \paren {13 + 1}\)

\(\ds 6 \times 14\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 84\)

Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $a, b, c \in G$.

Then the following hold:

Right cancellation law
$b a = c a \implies b = c$
Left cancellation law
$a b = a c \implies b = c$


Proof
From its definition, a group is a monoid, all of whose elements have inverses and thus are invertible.
From Invertible Element of Monoid is Cancellable, it follows that all its elements are therefore cancellable.
$\blacksquare$

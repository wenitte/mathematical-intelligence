Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle whose sides are $a$, $b$ and $c$ opposite vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively.
Then we have the following relation:

$\dfrac 1 r = \dfrac 1 {\rho_a} + \dfrac 1 {\rho_b} + \dfrac 1 {\rho_c}$
where:

$r$ is the inradius
$\rho_a$, $\rho_b$ and $\rho_c$ are the exradii of $\triangle ABC$ with respect to $a$, $b$ and $c$ respectively.


Proof
The area $\AA$ of $\triangle ABC$ is given by:














\(\ds \AA\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \rho_a \paren {s - a}\)





Area of Triangle in Terms of Exradius








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac 1 {\rho_a}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {s - a} \AA\)





rearranging



Similarly:














\(\ds \quad \quad \frac 1 {\rho_b}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {s - b} \AA\)




















\(\ds \frac 1 {\rho_c}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {s - c} \AA\)









Hence:














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {\rho_a} + \frac 1 {\rho_b} + \frac 1 {\rho_c}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {s - a} \AA + \frac {s - b} \AA + \frac {s - c} \AA\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {3 s - a - b - c} \AA\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {3 s - 2 s} \AA\)

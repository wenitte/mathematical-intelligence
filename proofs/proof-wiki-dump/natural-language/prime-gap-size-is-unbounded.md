Theorem
Let $n \in \N$ be a natural number, arbitrarily large.
Then there exist consecutive prime numbers $p_1$ and $p_2$ such that:

$p_2 - p_1 > n$
That is, the size of prime gaps is unbounded.
That is, there are blocks of consecutive composite numbers whose length exceeds any given $n \in \N$.


Proof
Let $p$ be a prime number greater than $n + 1$.
Consider the primorial:

$q = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times \cdots \times p$
All of the $p - 1$ numbers:

$q + 2, q + 3, q + 4, \ldots, q + p$
are composite.
Hence the result.

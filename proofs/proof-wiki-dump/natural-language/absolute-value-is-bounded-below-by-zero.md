Theorem
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number.
Then the absolute value $\size x$ of $x$ is bounded below by $0$.


Proof
Let $x \ge 0$.
Then $\size x = x \ge 0$.

Let $x < 0$.
Then $\size x = -x > 0$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$


Notes
This result applies also to the set of integers $\Z$ and rational numbers $\Q$.
In that context the result is usually included as part of the field of number theory as well as that of analysis.

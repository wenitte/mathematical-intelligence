Theorem
Let $u$ be a differentiable real function of $x$.
Then:

$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\tan u} = \sec^2 u \dfrac {\d u} {\d x}$
where $\tan$ is the tangent function and $\sec$ is the secant function.


Proof













\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {\tan u}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d u} } {\tan u} \frac {\d u} {\d x}\)





Chain Rule for Derivatives














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sec^2 u \frac {\d u} {\d x}\)

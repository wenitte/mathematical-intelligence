Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\BB$ be a synthetic basis on $S$.

The following definitions of the concept of Topology Generated by Synthetic Basis are equivalent:

Definition 1
The topology on $S$ generated by $\BB$ is defined as:

$\tau = \set{\bigcup \AA: \AA \subseteq \BB}$
That is, the set of all unions of sets from $\BB$.

Definition 2
The topology on $S$ generated by $\BB$ is defined as:

$\tau = \set {U \subseteq S: U = \bigcup \set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U}}$
Definition 3
The topology on $S$ generated by $\BB$ is defined as:

$\tau = \set {U \subseteq S: \forall x \in U: \exists B \in \BB: x \in B \subseteq U}$


Proof
Definition 1 iff Definition 2
Trivially, the reverse implication holds, as $\set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U} \subseteq \BB$.

We now show that the forward implication holds.
Suppose $U \in \tau$.
Then, by definition:

$\ds \exists \AA \subseteq \BB: U = \bigcup \AA$
By Union is Smallest Superset: General Result:

$\forall B \in \AA: B \subseteq U$
By definition of subset, it follows that:

$\AA \subseteq \set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U}$
From Union of Subset of Family is Subset of Union of Family:

$\ds U = \bigcup \AA \subseteq \bigcup \set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U}$
By Union is Smallest Superset: General Result:

$\ds \bigcup \set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U} \subseteq U$
By definition of set equality:

$\ds U = \bigcup \set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U}$
$\Box$


Definition 1 iff Definition 3
From Set is Subset of Union: General Result, the forward implication directly follows.

We now show that the reverse implication holds.
By hypothesis, we have that:

$\ds U \subseteq \bigcup \set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U}$
By Union is Smallest Superset: General Result:

$\ds \bigcup \set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U} \subseteq U$

By definition of set equality:

$\ds U = \bigcup \set {B \in \BB: B \subseteq U}$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

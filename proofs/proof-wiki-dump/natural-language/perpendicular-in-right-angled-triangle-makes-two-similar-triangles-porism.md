Porism to Perpendicular in Right-Angled Triangle makes two Similar Triangles
In the words of Euclid:

From this it is clear that, if in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn from the right angle to the base, the straight line so drawn is a mean proportional between the segments of the base.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VI}$: Proposition $8$ : Porism)


Proof
Follows directly from Perpendicular in Right-Angled Triangle makes two Similar Triangles.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $8$ of Book $\text{VI}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

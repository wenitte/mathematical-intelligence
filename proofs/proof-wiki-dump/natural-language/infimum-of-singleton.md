Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.

Then for all $a \in S$:

$\inf \set a = a$
where $\inf$ denotes infimum.


Proof
Since $a \preceq a$, $a$ is a lower bound for $\set a$.
Let $b$ be another lower bound for $\set a$.
Then necessarily $b \preceq a$.

It follows that indeed:

$\inf \set a = a$
as desired.
$\blacksquare$

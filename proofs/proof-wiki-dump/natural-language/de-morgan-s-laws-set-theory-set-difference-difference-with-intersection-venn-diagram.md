Theorem
$S \setminus \paren {T_1 \cap T_2} = \paren {S \setminus T_1} \cup \paren {S \setminus T_2}$


Proof
Demonstration by Venn diagram:


The area in blue and magenta is the set difference of $S$ with $T_1$
The area in orange and magenta is set difference of $S$ with $T_2$
The complete shaded area is the set difference of $S$ with the intersection of $T_1$ and $T_2$.
It is also seen to be the union of the set difference of $S$ with $T_1$ and the set difference of $S$ with $T_2$.
$\blacksquare$

Problem 1 from Berlin PapyrusÂ $\mathit { 6619 }$
If it is said to thee:
the area of a square of $100$ is equal to that of two smaller squares.
The side of one is $\frac 1 2 + \frac 1 4$ the side of the other.
Let me know the sides of the two unknown squares.


Solution
The sides of the two unknown squares are $6$ and $8$.


Proof
The method of solution used is the rule of false position.
Assume that:














\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 2 + \dfrac 1 4 = \dfrac 3 4\)




















\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 + y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 + \dfrac 9 {16}\)










But the result should be:

$100 = 64 \times \paren {1 + \dfrac 9 {16} }$
Therefore, our two squares must be $64$ times bigger.
Therefore their sides must be $8$ times bigger.

So the result is:














\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 3 4 \times 8\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)




















\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 \times 8\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 + y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)









$\blacksquare$

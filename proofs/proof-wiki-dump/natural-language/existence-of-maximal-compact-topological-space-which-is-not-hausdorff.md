Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\tau$ be the minimal subset of the power set $\powerset S$ such that $\struct {S, \tau}$ is a compact topological space.
Then it is not necessarily the case that $\struct {S, \tau}$ is a Hausdorff space.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be the canonical maximal compact non-Hausdorff space.
This space has been so named on $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ in order to allow reference to it without needing to describe it whenever it is mentioned.
By Canonical Maximal Compact Non-Hausdorff Space is Maximal Compact, $\tau$ is the maximal subset of the power set $\powerset S$ such that $T$ is compact.
By Canonical Maximal Compact Non-Hausdorff Space is not Hausdorff, $T$ is not a  Hausdorff space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

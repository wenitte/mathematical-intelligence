Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.

The following are dual statements:

$\struct{S, \vee, \preceq}$ is a join semilattice, where $\vee$ is the  join for all $a,b \in S$
$\struct{S, \wedge, \preceq}$ is a meet semilattice, where $\wedge$ is the  meet for all $a,b \in S$


Proof
By definition of join semilattice:

$\struct{S, \vee, \preceq}$ is a join semilattice
if and only if:

$\forall a,b \in S : a \vee b \in S$, where $a \vee b$ is the  join  of $a$ and $b$

The dual of this statement is:

$\forall a,b \in S : a \wedge b \in S$, where $a \wedge b$ is the  meet  of $a$ and $b$
by Dual Pairs (Order Theory).

By definition of meet semilattice:

$\struct{S, \wedge, \preceq}$ is a meet semilattice
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $m$ and $n$ be natural numbers.
Then it cannot be the case that both $m \in n$ and $n \in m$.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose both $m \in n$ and $n \in m$.
We have $m \in n$
From Natural Number is Transitive Set:

$m \subseteq n$
by definition of transitive.
Thus:

$n \in m \subseteq n$
and so:

$n \in n$
But from Natural Number is Ordinary Set:

$n \notin n$
The result follows by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

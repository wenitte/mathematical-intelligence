Examples of Harmonic Ranges
Let $A$, $B$, $P$ and $Q$ be points on a straight line.

Let $\tuple {AB, PQ}$ be a harmonic range such that $P$ is the midpoint of $AB$.
Then $Q$ is the point at infinity.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $AQ$ is of finite length.
Let $p := AP$ and $q := AQ$ be the (undirected) lengths of $AP$ and $AQ$ respectively.
By construction, $AP = PB$.
Then:














\(\ds \quad \dfrac {AP} {PB}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac {AQ} {QB}\)





Definition of Harmonic Range














\(\ds \dfrac p p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac q {q - 2 p}\)




















\(\ds q - 2 p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds q\)




















\(\ds 2 p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)









That is, the length of $AP$ is zero.
which contradicts the definition of $AP$.
Hence $AQ$ can not be of finite length.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $\struct {\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ be the ring of continuous real-valued functions from $S$.

Then:

$\struct{\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ is a commutative ring


Proof
By definition of ring of continuous real-valued functions:

$\struct {\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ is the ring of continuous mappings from $S$ to $\R$.
From Commutativity of Ring of Continuous Mappings:

$\struct{\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ is a commutative ring
$\blacksquare$

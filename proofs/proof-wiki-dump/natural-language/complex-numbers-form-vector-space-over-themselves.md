Theorem
The set of complex numbers $\C$, with the operations of addition and multiplication, forms a vector space.


Proof
Let the field of complex numbers be denoted $\struct {\C, +, \times}$.
By Complex Numbers under Addition form Infinite Abelian Group, $\struct {\C, +}$ is an abelian group.
From Complex Multiplication Distributes over Addition:










\(\ds \forall x, y, z \in \C: \, \)



\(\ds x \times \paren {y + z}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x \times y + x \times z\)




















\(\ds \paren {y + z} \times x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y \times x + z \times x\)









From Complex Multiplication is Associative:

$\forall x, y, z \in \C: x \times \paren {y \times z} = \paren {x \times y} \times z$
From Complex Multiplication Identity is One:

$\forall x \in \C: 1 \times x = x$

Therefore $\struct {\C, +, \times}$ forms a vector space.
$\blacksquare$

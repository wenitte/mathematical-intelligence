Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $17$
De Tribus Fratribus Singulas Habentibus Sorores
Three Friends and their Sisters
Three friends, each with a sister, needed to cross a river.
Each one of them coveted the sister of another.
At the river, they found only a small boat, in which only two of them could cross at a time.
How did they cross the river, without any of the women being defiled by the men?


Solution
The constraint here is that at no time may a man be on the same bank as (or in the boat with) the sister of another, without the brother of that sister being present as well.
Let $M_1$, $M_2$ and $M_3$ denote the men, and $S_1$, $S_2$ and $S_3$ denote their respective sisters.
Let them be crossing from $A$ to $B$.
As follows:


Solution 1
$M_1$ and $S_1$ cross from $A$ to $B$.
$M_1$ crosses back alone from $B$ to $A$.
$S_2$ and $S_3$ cross from $A$ to $B$.
$S_1$ crosses back alone from $B$ to $A$.
$M_2$ and $M_3$ cross from $A$ to $B$.
$M_2$ and $S_2$ cross back from $B$ to $A$.
$M_1$ and $M_2$ cross from $A$ to $B$.
$S_3$ crosses back alone from $B$ to $A$.
$S_1$ and $S_3$ cross from $A$ to $B$.
$M_3$ crosses back alone from $B$ to $A$.
$M_3$ and $S_3$ cross from $A$ to $B$.
"And that would complete the crossing without anything untoward happening."

This was the original solution given in Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York.
It is not optimal.
$\blacksquare$


Solution 2
$M_1$ and $S_1$ cross from $A$ to $B$.
$M_1$ crosses back alone from $B$ to $A$.
$S_2$ and $S_3$ cross from $A$ to $B$.
$S_1$ crosses back alone from $B$ to $A$.
$M_1$ and $S_1$ cross from $A$ to $B$.
$M_1$ crosses back alone from $B$ to $A$.
$M_2$ and $M_3$ cross from $A$ to $B$.
$S_1$ crosses back alone from $B$ to $A$.
$M_1$ and $S_1$ cross from $A$ to $B$.
$\blacksquare$


Also presented as
This can also be presented as men with their wives, rather than sisters.

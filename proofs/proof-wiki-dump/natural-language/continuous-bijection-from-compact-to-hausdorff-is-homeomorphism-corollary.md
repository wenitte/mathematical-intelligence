Corollary to Continuous Bijection from Compact to Hausdorff is Homeomorphism
Let $T_1$ be a compact space.
Let $T_2$ be a Hausdorff space.
Let $f: T_1 \to T_2$ be a continuous injection.

Then $f$ determines a homeomorphism from $T_1$ to $f \sqbrk {T_1}$.
That is, $f$ is an embedding of $T_1$ into $T_2$.


Proof
Follows from Continuous Bijection from Compact to Hausdorff is Homeomorphism and Continuity of Composite with Inclusion.
$\blacksquare$

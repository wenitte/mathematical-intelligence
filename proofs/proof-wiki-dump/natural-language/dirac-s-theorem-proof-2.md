Theorem
Let $G$ be a connected simple graph with $n$ vertices such that $n > 3$.
Let the degree of each vertex be at least $\dfrac n 2$.
Then $G$ is Hamiltonian.


Proof
Take any two non-adjacent vertices $u, v \in G$.
Then:

$\deg u + \deg v \ge \dfrac n 2 + \dfrac n 2 = n$
The result follows by a direct application of Ore's Theorem.

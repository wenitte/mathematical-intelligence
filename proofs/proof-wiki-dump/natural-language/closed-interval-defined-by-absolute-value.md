Theorem
Let $\xi, \delta \in \R$ be real numbers.
Let $\delta > 0$.

Then:

$\set {x \in \R: \size {\xi - x} \le \delta} = \closedint {\xi - \delta} {\xi + \delta}$
where $\closedint {\xi - \delta} {\xi + \delta}$ is the closed real interval between $\xi - \delta$ and $\xi + \delta$.


Proof













\(\ds \size {\xi - x}\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds \delta\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds -\delta\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds \xi - x \le \delta\)





Negative of Absolute Value: Corollary $2$








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds \delta\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds x - \xi \le -\delta\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds \xi + \delta\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds x \le \xi - \delta\)










But:

$\closedint {\xi - \delta} {\xi + \delta} = \set {x \in \R: \xi - \delta \le x \le \xi + \delta}$
$\blacksquare$


Also presented as
$\set {x \in \R: \size {x - \xi} \le \delta} = \closedint {\xi - \delta} {\xi + \delta}$
which is immediate from:

$\size {x - \xi} = \size {\xi - x}$

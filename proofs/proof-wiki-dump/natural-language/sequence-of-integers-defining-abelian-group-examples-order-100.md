Examples of Sequences of Integers defining Abelian Groups
Let $G$ be an abelian group of order $100$.
From Sequence of Integers defining Abelian Group, $G$ can be expressed in the form:

$G = C_{n_1} C_{n_2} \cdots C_{n_r}$

The possible sequences $\tuple {n_1, n_2, \ldots n_r}$ of positive integers which can define $G$ are:














\(\ds r = 1:\)

\(\)







\(\ds \tuple {100}\)




















\(\ds r = 2:\)

\(\)







\(\ds \tuple {50, 2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \tuple {20, 5}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \tuple {10, 10}\)

Corollary to Modulus of Exponential of Imaginary Number is One
Let $t > 0$ be wholly real.
Let $t^{i x}$ be $t$ to the power of $i x$ defined on its principal branch.

Then:

$\cmod {t^{ix} } = 1$


Proof













\(\ds \cmod {t^{i x} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cmod {e^{i x \ln t} }\)





Definition of $t$ to the Power of $ix$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)





Modulus of Exponential of Imaginary Number is One, as $x \ln t$ is wholly real for $t > 0$



$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ denote the set of the facets of Rukik's cube.
Then $S$ can be partitioned as follows:

$S = \set {S_C \mid S_E \mid S_Z}$
where:

$S_C$ denotes the set of corner facets
$S_E$ denotes the set of edge facets
$S_Z$ denotes the set of center facets.


Proof
From the definition of the facets, each face is divided into $9$ facets.


A facet is either:

on the corner of a face, for example $flu$, $fru$
on the edge of a face, for example $fu$, $fr$
in the center of a face, for example $F$.
$(1):\quad$ Each facet can be either in $S_C$ or $S_E$ or $S_Z$ and can not be in more than one.
$(2):\quad$ Each facet can be either in $S_C$ or $S_E$ or $S_Z$ and there are no other possibilities.
$(3):\quad$ None of $S_C$, $S_E$ and $S_Z$ is empty.
Thus the criteria for $S = \set {S_C \mid S_E \mid S_Z}$ to be a partition are fulfilled.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {K, +, \times}$ be a division ring.
Let $\struct {S, +, \times}$ be the prime subfield of $K$

Then $\struct {K, +, \times_S}_S$ is an $S$-vector space, where $\times_S$ is the restriction of $\times$ to $S \times K$.


Proof
Because $K$ is a division ring, it satisfies the vector space axioms for addition, in particular it is an abelian group. The distribuitivty and associativity of multiplication follow from the rules for multiplciation in any ring. Also, any prime field contains the multiplicative identity.

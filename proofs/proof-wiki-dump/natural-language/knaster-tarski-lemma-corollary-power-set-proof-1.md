Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.
Let $f: \powerset S \to \powerset S$ be a $\subseteq$-increasing mapping.
That is, suppose that for all $T, U \in \powerset S$:

$T \subseteq U \implies \map f T \subseteq \map f U$

Then $f$ has a fixed point.


Proof
By the Knaster-Tarski Lemma: Power Set, $f$ has a least fixed point.
Thus it has a fixed point.
$\blacksquare$

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $139$
Working Alone
Alfred and Bill together can do a job of work in $24$ days.
If Alfred can do two-thirds as much as Bill, how long will it take each of them to do the work alone?


Solution
Alfred would take $60$ days, while Bill would take $40$ days.


Proof
Let $t_a$ and $t_b$ be the time taken for Alfred and Bill to do the job.
Let $a$ and $b$ be the rate in days at which Alfred and Bill can do the job.

In $24$ days, the contributions of Alfred and Bill is $24 a$ and $24 b$ respectively.
So for the total contribution to the job, we have:














\(\ds 24 \paren {a + b}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 24\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {a + b}\)










We have:














\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {t_b}\)




















\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {t_a}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 2 {3 t_b}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a + b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {t_b} + \dfrac 2 {3 t_b}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a + b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 5 {3 t_b}\)










and so:














\(\ds 24\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {a + b}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {3 t_b} 5\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t_b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {5 \times 24} 3\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t_a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {3 \times 40} 2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60\)









So Alfred would take $60$ days, while Bill would take $40$ days.

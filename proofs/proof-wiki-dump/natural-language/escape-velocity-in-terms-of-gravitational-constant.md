Theorem
Let $P$ be a planet.
Let $P$ have:

a mass of $M$
a radius of $R$.

Then the escape velocity of $P$ is given by:

$V = \sqrt {\dfrac {2 M G} R}$
where $G$ is the gravitational constant.


Proof
Let $b$ be a particle with mass $m$.  
Let $K_i$ be the kinetic energy of $b$ at the surface of $P$.  
Let $U_i$ be the potential energy of $b$ at the surface of $P$. 
Let $K_f$ be the limit of the kinetic energy of $b$ as it leaves $P$. 
Let $U_f$ be the limit of the potential energy of $b$ as it leaves $P$. 
Let $v_f$ be the limit of the speed of $b$ as it leaves $P$. 
Let $r_f$ be the limit of the distance of $b$ from the center of $P$ as $b$ leaves $P$. 
Let $v_e$ be the speed of $b$ at the surface of $P$.  

The speed of $b$ becomes arbitarily small as it leaves $P$.
Thus:

$v_f = 0$
The distance of $b$ to the center of $P$ becomes arbitarily large as it leaves $P$.
Thus:

$r_f = \infty$

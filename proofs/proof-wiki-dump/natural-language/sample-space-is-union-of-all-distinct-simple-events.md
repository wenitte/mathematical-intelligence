Theorem
Let $\EE$ be an experiment.
Let $\Omega$ denote the sample space of $\EE$.

Then $\Omega$ is the union of the set of simple events in $\EE$.


Proof
By Set is Subset of Itself:

$\Omega \subseteq \Omega$
That is, $\Omega$ is itself an event in $\EE$.
The result as an application of Non-Trivial Event is Union of Simple Events.
$\blacksquare$

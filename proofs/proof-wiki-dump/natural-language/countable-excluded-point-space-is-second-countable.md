Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_{\bar p} }$ be a countable excluded point space.

Then $T$ is a second-countable space.


Proof 1
Consider the set $\BB$ defined as:

$\BB = \set {\set x: x \in S \setminus \set p} \cup \set S$
From Basis for Excluded Point Space, $\BB$ is a basis for $T$, and trivially has the same cardinality as $S$.
So by definition, if $S$ is countable, then $T$ is second-countable.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
We have:

Countable Discrete Space is Second-Countable
Excluded Point Topology is Open Extension Topology of Discrete Topology
The result follows from Condition for Open Extension Space to be Second-Countable.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is second-countable.

Then $T$ is also first-countable.


Proof
By definition $T$ is second-countable if and only if its topology has a countable basis.
Consider the entire set $S$ as an open set.
From Set is Open iff Neighborhood of all its Points, $S$ has that property.
As $T$ has a countable basis, then (trivially) every point in $T$ has a countable local basis.
So a second-countable space is trivially first-countable.
$\blacksquare$

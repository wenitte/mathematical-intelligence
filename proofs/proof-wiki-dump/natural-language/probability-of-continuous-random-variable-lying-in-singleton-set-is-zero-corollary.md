Theorem
Let $\struct {\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr}$ be a probability space. 
Let $X$ be a continuous real variable on $\struct {\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr}$.
Let $C$ be a countable subset of $\R$. 

Then: 

$\map \Pr {X \in C} = 0$


Proof
Since $C$ is countable, there exists a sequence $\sequence {x_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ of distinct real numbers such that: 

$C = \set {x_nÂ : n \mathop \in \N}$
That is: 

$\ds C = \bigcup_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty \set {x_n}$
where $\set {\set {x_1}, \set {x_2}, \ldots}$ is pairwise disjoint.
We then have: 














\(\ds \map \Pr {X \in C}\)

\(\ds \map {P_X} C\)

\(\ds \map {P_X} {\bigcup_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty \set {x_n} }\)

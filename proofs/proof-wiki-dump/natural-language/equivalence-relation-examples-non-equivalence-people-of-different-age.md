Example of Relation which is not Equivalence
Let $P$ be the set of people.
Let $\sim$ be the relation on $P$ defined as:

$\forall \tuple {x, y} \in P \times P: x \sim y \iff \text { the age of $x$ and $y$ on their last birthdays was not the same}$
Then $\sim$ is not an equivalence relation.


Proof
$\sim$ is antireflexive, as everybody is the same age as themselves.
$\sim$ is symmetric, as two people are either the same age or they are not.
$\sim$ is not transitive, because if $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$, it is impossible to say whether $a \sim c$.
$\blacksquare$

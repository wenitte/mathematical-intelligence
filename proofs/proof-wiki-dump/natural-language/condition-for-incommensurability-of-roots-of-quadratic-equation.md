Theorem
Consider the quadratic equation:

$(1): \quad a x - x^2 = \dfrac {b^2} 4$

Then $x$ and $a - x$ are incommensurable if and only if $\sqrt {a^2 - b^2}$ and $a$ are incommensurable.

In the words of Euclid:

If there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divide it into parts which are incommensurable, the square on the greater will be greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the greater.And, if the square on the greater be greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the greater, and if there be applied to the greater a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, it divides it into parts which are incommensurable.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $18$)


Proof
We have that:














\(\ds x \paren {a - x} + \paren {\frac a 2 - x}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a x - x^2 + \frac {a^2} 4 - 2 \frac a 2 x + x^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {a^2} 4\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4 x \paren {a - x} + 4 \paren {\frac a 2 - x}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b^2 + \paren {a - 2 x}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2\)





from $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^2 - b^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a - 2 x}^2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \sqrt {a^2 - b^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a - 2 x\)










Let:

$a \smile b$ denote that $a$ is incommensurable with $b$
$a \frown b$ denote that $a$ is commensurable with $b$.


Necessary Condition
Let $\paren {a - x} \smile x$.
From Incommensurability of Sum of Incommensurable Magnitudes:

$a \smile x$
From Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable:

$x \frown 2 x$
So:














\(\ds a\)

\(\smile\)







\(\ds 2 x\)





Commensurable Magnitudes are Incommensurable with Same Magnitude














\(\ds \)

\(\smile\)







\(\ds \paren {a - 2 x}\)





Incommensurability of Sum of Incommensurable Magnitudes














\(\ds \)

\(\smile\)







\(\ds \sqrt {a^2 - b^2}\)









$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Let $a \smile \sqrt {a^2 - b^2}$.
Then:














\(\ds a\)

\(\smile\)







\(\ds \sqrt {a^2 - b^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\smile\)







\(\ds \paren {a - 2 x}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\smile\)







\(\ds 2 x\)





Incommensurability of Sum of Incommensurable Magnitudes




From Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable:

$x \frown 2 x$
From Commensurable Magnitudes are Incommensurable with Same Magnitude:

$a \smile x$
From Incommensurability of Sum of Incommensurable Magnitudes:

$\paren {a - x} \smile x$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $18$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

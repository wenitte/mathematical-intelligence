Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau_p}\right)$ be an infinite particular point space.

Then $T$ is not metacompact.


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $T$ is metacompact.
From Metacompact Space is Countably Metacompact it follows that $T$ is countably metacompact.
But we have that Infinite Particular Point Space is not Countably Metacompact.
Hence the result by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

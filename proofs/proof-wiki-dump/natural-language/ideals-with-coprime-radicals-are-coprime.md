Theorem
Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $\mathfrak a, \mathfrak b \subseteq A$ be ideals.
Let their radicals be coprime:

$\map \Rad {\mathfrak a} + \map \Rad {\mathfrak b} = \ideal 1$

Then $\mathfrak a$ and $\mathfrak b$ are coprime:

$\mathfrak a + \mathfrak b = \ideal 1$


Proof
We have:














\(\ds \map \Rad {\mathfrak a + \mathfrak b}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \Rad {\map \Rad {\mathfrak a} + \map \Rad {\mathfrak b} }\)





Radical of Sum of Ideals














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \Rad {\ideal 1}\)





$\map \Rad {\mathfrak a}$ and $\map \Rad {\mathfrak b}$ are coprime














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \ideal 1\)





Radical of Unit Ideal



By Unit Ideal iff Radical is Unit Ideal:

$\mathfrak a + \mathfrak b = \ideal 1$
That is, $\mathfrak a$ and $\mathfrak b$ are coprime.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is locally arc-connected.
Then $T$ is also locally path-connected.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be arc-connected.
Then $T$ has a basis consisting entirely of arc-connected sets.
From Arc-Connected Space is Path-Connected, this basis consisting entirely of path-connected sets.
The result follows from definition of locally path-connected.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\R_{\ne 0}$ be the set of real numbers without zero:

$\R_{\ne 0} = \R \setminus \set 0$
The structure $\struct {\R_{\ne 0}, \times}$ is an uncountable abelian group.


Proof
We have Real Numbers under Multiplication form Monoid.
From Inverse for Real Multiplication, the non-zero numbers are exactly the invertible elements of real multiplication.
Thus from Invertible Elements of Monoid form Subgroup of Cancellable Elements, the non-zero real numbers under multiplication form a group.
From:

Real Multiplication is Commutative
Subset Product within Commutative Structure is Commutative
it follows that this group is also Abelian.

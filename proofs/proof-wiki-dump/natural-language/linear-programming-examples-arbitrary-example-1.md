Examples of Linear Programming
Let it be required to find the minimum of the function:

$\map U {x, y} = 4 x + 3 y$
subject to the conditions:














\(\ds x + y\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds 20\)




















\(\ds 3 x + y\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds 30\)




















\(\ds x\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds y\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds 0\)









The maximum feasible value of $U$ is given by:

$U = 65$


Proof
Let us present the above information in a graphical form:




The $\color { red } {\text {red} }$ lines represent the boundary lines of the conditions:

the line $AB$ represents the condition $x + y = 20$
the line $CD$ represents the condition $3 x + y = 30$
while the axes represent the conditions $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
Hence the region in which feasible solutions exist is the colored region $OAED$.

The dashed parallel lines represent the equation $U = 4 x + 3 y$ for various values of $U$.
As $U$ increases, the dashed line moves to the right.

Hence the optimum value of $U$ occurs when $U$ is chosen so that the line passes through the point $E$.
This is where the lines $x + y = 20$ and $3 x + y = 30$ intersect.

Solving these simultaneous equations gives us:














\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)




















\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 15\)










Hence the maximum feasible value of $U$ is given by:














\(\ds U\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 5 + 3 \times 15\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 65\)









which is the optimum solution.

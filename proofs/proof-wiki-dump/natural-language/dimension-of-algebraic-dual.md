Theorem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $G$ be an $n$-dimensional $R$-module.
Let $G^*$ be the algebraic dual of $G$.

Then $G^*$ is also $n$-dimensional.


Dimension of Double Dual
Let $G^{**}$ be the double dual of $G$.

Then $G^{**}$ is also $n$-dimensional.


Proof
Let $\struct {R, +_R, \circ}_R$ denote the $R$-module $R$.
From Dimension of $R$-Module $R$ is $1$ we have that the dimension of $\struct {R, +_R, \circ}_R$ is $1$.
By definition, the algebraic dual of $G$ is the $R$-module $\map {\LL_R} {G, R}$ of all linear forms on $G$.
From Dimension of Set of Linear Transformations the dimension of $G^*$ is the product of the dimension of $G$ with the dimension of $\struct {R, +_R, \circ}_R$.
That is:

$\map \dim {G^*} = n \times 1$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

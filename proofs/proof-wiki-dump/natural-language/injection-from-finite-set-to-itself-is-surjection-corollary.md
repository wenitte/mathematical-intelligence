Theorem
Let $S$ be a finite set.
Let $f: S \to S$ be an injection.

Then $f$ is a permutation.


Proof
From Injection from Finite Set to Itself is Surjection, $f$ is a surjection.
As $f$ is thus both an injection and a surjection, $f$ is a bijection by definition.
Thus as $f$ is a bijection to itself, it is by definition a permutation.
$\blacksquare$

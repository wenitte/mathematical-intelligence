Theorem
Let $S$ be a Gaussian stochastic process giving rise to a time series $T$.
Let the the mean of $S$ be fixed.
Let the autocovariance matrix of $S$ also be fixed.

Then $S$ is stationary.


Proof
From Characterization of Multivariate Normal Distribution, the normal distribution is completely characterized by its expectation and its variance.
The result follows.

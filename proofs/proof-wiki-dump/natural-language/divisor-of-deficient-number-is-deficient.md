Theorem
Let $n$ be a perfect number.
Let $n = k d$ where $r$ is a positive integer.

Then $k$ is deficient.


Proof
We have by definition of divisor sum function and perfect number that:

$\dfrac {\map {\sigma_1} {k d} } {k d} < 2$
But from Abundancy Index of Product is greater than Abundancy Index of Proper Factors:

$\dfrac {\map {\sigma_1} {k d} } {k d} > \dfrac {\map {\sigma_1} k} k$
That is:

$\dfrac {\map {\sigma_1} k} k < 2$
Hence the result by definition of deficient.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\Sigma$ be a finite alphabet.
Let $\Sigma^*$ be the set of finite strings of $\Sigma$.
Let $\powerset {\Sigma^*}$ be the power set of $\Sigma^*$

Then $\powerset {\Sigma^*}$ is an uncountable set.


Proof
From Set of Finite Strings is Countably Infinite, $\Sigma^*$ is a countably infinite set.
The result follows from Power Set of Countably Infinite Set is Uncountable.
$\blacksquare$

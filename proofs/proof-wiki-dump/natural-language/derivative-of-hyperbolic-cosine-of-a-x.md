Theorem
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\cosh a x} = a \sinh a x$


Proof













\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\cosh x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sinh x\)





Derivative of $\cosh x$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\cosh a x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \sinh a x\)





Derivative of Function of Constant Multiple



$\blacksquare$

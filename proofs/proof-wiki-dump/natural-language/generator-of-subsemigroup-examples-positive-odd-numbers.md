Example of Generator of Subsemigroup
Let $\struct {\Z, +}$ be the additive group of integers.
Let $A$ be the set of positive odd integers.
The subsemigroup of $\struct {\Z, +}$ generated by $A$ is the semigroup of strictly positive integers under addition.


Proof
Let $\struct {S, +}$ be the subsemigroup of $\struct {\Z, +}$ generated by $A$.
First we note that $\struct {A, +}$ is not itself closed, as:














\(\ds 1\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds A\)




















\(\ds 1 + 1\)

\(\notin\)







\(\ds A\)









Then we note that:

$\forall x \in \Z_{>0}: \begin {cases} x \in A & : \text {$x$ odd} \\ \exists y \in A: x = y + 1 & : \text {$x$ even} \end {cases}$
Hence $\Z_{>0}$ is the smallest subset of $\Z$ on which $+$ is a closed operation.
So:

$A + A = \Z_{>0}$
and from Non-Zero Natural Numbers under Addition form Semigroup, it follows that $\struct {\Z_{>0}, +}$ is a semigroup.
Hence the result by definition of subsemigroup of $\struct {\Z, +}$ generated by $A$.
$\blacksquare$

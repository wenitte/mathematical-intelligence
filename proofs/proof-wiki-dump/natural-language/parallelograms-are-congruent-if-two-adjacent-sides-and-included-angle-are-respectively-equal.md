Theorem
Let $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ be parallelograms.
Then $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are congruent if:

$2$ adjacent sides of $ABCD$ are equal to $2$ corresponding adjacent sides of $EFGH$
the angle between those $2$ adjacent sides on both $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are equal.


Proof
Without loss of generality let the $2$ adjacent sides of $ABCD$ be $AB$ and $BC$.
Let the $2$ corresponding adjacent sides of $EFGH$ be $EF$ and $FG$ such that $AB = EF$ and $BC = FG$.
Hence let $\angle ABC = \angle EFG$.

From Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence:

$\triangle ABC = \triangle EFG$
From Quadrilateral is Parallelogram iff Both Pairs of Opposite Angles are Equal:

$\angle ABC = \angle ADC$
$\angle EFG = \angle EHG$
From Quadrilateral is Parallelogram iff Both Pairs of Opposite Sides are Equal or Parallel:

$AB = CD$
and:

$EF = GF$
Thus again by Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence:

$\triangle ADC = \triangle EHG$
So:

$\triangle ABC + \triangle ADC = \triangle EFG + \triangle EHG$
and the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

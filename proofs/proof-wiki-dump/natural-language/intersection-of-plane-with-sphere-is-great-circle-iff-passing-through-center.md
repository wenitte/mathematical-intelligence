Theorem
Let $S$ be a sphere.
Let $P$ be a plane which intersects $S$ but is not tangent to $S$.
Let $C$ be the circle formed by the intersection between $P$ and $S$.

Then $C$ is a great circle of $S$ if and only if $P$ passes through the center of $S$.
Otherwise $C$ is a small circle of $S$.


Proof
From Intersection of Plane with Sphere is Circle it is confirmed that $C$ is indeed a circle.
Recall the definition of Great Circle:
Let $S$ be a sphere.
A great circle of $S$ is defined as the intersection of $S$ with a plane passing through the center of $S$.




Recall the definition of Small Circle:
A small circle on a sphere $S$ is defined as the intersection of $S$ with a plane which does not pass through the center of $S$.

The result follows directly.

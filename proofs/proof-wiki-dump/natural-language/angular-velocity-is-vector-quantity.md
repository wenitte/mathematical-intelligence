Theorem
The physical quantity that is angular velocity can be correctly handled as a vector.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: The definition of angular velocity is currently being left open until a rigorous book-definition can be found for it which puts that definition firmly into context. The current works under analysis seem to take its definition for granted.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Proof
In order to show that angular velocity is a vector, it is sufficient to demonstrate that it fulfils the vector space axioms.
Specifically, all we need to do is demonstrate the following.
Let $\bsomega_1$ be the angular velocity of a body about an axis which passes through a fixed point $O$.
Let $P$ be a point in $B$ whose position vector with respect to $O$ is $\mathbf r$.
The tangential velocity of $P$ is $\bsomega_1 \times \mathbf r$.
Now let $\bsomega_2$ be the angular velocity about a different axis which also passes through $O$ at an angle to the first axis.
The tangential velocity of $P$ due to this angular velocity is $\bsomega_2 \times \mathbf r$.
But linear velocities combine as vectors.
Hence the total linear velocity  of $P$ is given by:














\(\ds \bsomega_1 \times \mathbf r + \bsomega_2 \times \mathbf r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\bsomega_1 + \bsomega_2} \times \mathbf r\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds \bsomega \times \mathbf r\)









Hence the motion of $P$ is the same as it would be due to an angular velocity which is the vector sum of the two components.

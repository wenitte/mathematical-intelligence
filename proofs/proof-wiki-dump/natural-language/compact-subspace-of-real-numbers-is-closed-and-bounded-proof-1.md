Theorem
Let $\R$ be the real number line considered as a Euclidean space.
Let $S \subseteq \R$ be compact subspace of $\R$.

Then $S$ is closed and bounded in $\R$.


Proof
From:

Non-Closed Set of Real Numbers is not Compact
Unbounded Set of Real Numbers is not Compact
the result follows by the Rule of Transposition.
$\blacksquare$

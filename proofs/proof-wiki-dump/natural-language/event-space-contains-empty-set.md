Theorem
Let $\EE$ be an experiment with a probability space $\struct {\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr}$.

The event space $\Sigma$ of $\EE$ has the property that:

$\O \in \Sigma$
That is, the empty set is in the event space.


Proof













\(\ds \Sigma\)

\(\ne\)







\(\ds \O\)





Definition of Event Space: Axiom $(\text {ES} 1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)

\(\ds \exists A: \, \)



\(\ds A\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \Sigma\)





Definition of Empty Set








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds A \setminus A\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \Sigma\)





Definition of Event Space: Axiom $(\text {ES} 2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \O\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \Sigma\)





Set Difference with Self is Empty Set

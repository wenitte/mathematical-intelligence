Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \vee, \preceq}$ be a join semilattice.

Then $\vee$ is idempotent.


Proof
Let $a \in S$ be arbitrary.
Then:














\(\ds a \vee a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sup \set {a, a}\)





Definition of Join














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sup \set a\)





Definition of Set














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a\)





Supremum of Singleton



Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

This article is complete as far as it goes, but it could do with expansion.In particular: Needs to be phrased using a "partial operation" to remove the condition that $\vee$ is a total operationYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by adding this information.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Expand}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

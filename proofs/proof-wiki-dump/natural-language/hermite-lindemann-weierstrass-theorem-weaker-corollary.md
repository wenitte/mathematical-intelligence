Theorem
Let $a$ be a algebraic number (possibly complex) which is neither $0$ nor $1$.
Then:

any value of $\ln a$ is transcendental
where $\ln$ denotes complex natural logarithm.


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $\ln a$ is not transcendental.
Hence, by definition, it is algebraic.
Since $a$ is not $1$, $\ln a$ cannot be $0$.
Hence, by the weaker Hermite-Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, $e^{\ln a} = a$ is transcendental.
This contradicts with the assumption that $a$ is algebraic.
Hence, $\ln a$ must be transcendental.

Corollary to Bijection iff Left and Right Inverse
Let $f: S \to T$ and $g: T \to S$ be mappings such that:














\(\ds g \circ f\)

\(=\)







\(\ds I_S\)




















\(\ds f \circ g\)

\(=\)







\(\ds I_T\)









Then both $f$ and $g$ are bijections.


Proof
Suppose we have such mappings $f$ and $g$ with the given properties.
From Bijection iff Left and Right Inverse, we have that $f$ is a bijection, by considering $g = g_1$ and $g = g_2$.
It directly follows that by setting $g = f, f = g_1, f = g_2$, the result Bijection iff Left and Right Inverse can be used the other way about.
$\blacksquare$

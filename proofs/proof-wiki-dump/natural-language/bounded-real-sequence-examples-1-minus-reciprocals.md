Example of Bounded Real Sequence
Let $\sequence {s_n}_{n \mathop \ge 1}$ be the real sequence defined as:

$s_n = 1 - \dfrac 1 n$
That is:

$\sequence {s_n}$ is the sequence of $1$ minus the reciprocals of the strictly positive integers.
Then $\sequence {s_n}$ is bounded.


Proof
We have that $n \ge 1$.
Hence:

$0 < \dfrac 1 n \le 1$
Hence:

$0 \le 1 - \dfrac 1 n < 1$
Hence:

$0$ is a lower bound of $\sequence {s_n}$
$1$ is an upper bound of $\sequence {s_n}$.
Hence the result by definition of bounded real sequence.
$\blacksquare$

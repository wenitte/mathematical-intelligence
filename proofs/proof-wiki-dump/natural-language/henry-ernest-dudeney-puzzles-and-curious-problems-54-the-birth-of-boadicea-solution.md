Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $54$
The Birth of Boadicea
Boadicea died $129$ years after Cleopatra was born.
Their united ages (that is, the combined years of their complete lives) were $100$ years.
Cleopatra died $\text {30}$$\text { BCE}$.
When was Boadicea born?


Solution
She was born in $\text {1}$$\text { BCE}$.


Proof
Let $C_b$, $C_d$, $B_b$, $B_d$ denote the years of birth and death of Cleopatra and Boadicea respectively.
We have:














\(\ds B_d - C_b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 129\)





Boadicea died $129$ years after Cleopatra was born.














\(\ds \paren {B_d - B_b} + \paren {C_d - C_b}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





Their united ages (that is, the combined years of their complete lives) were $100$ years.














\(\ds C_d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -30\)





Cleopatra died $\text {30}$$\text { BCE}$.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 129 - B_p - 30\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds B_p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -1\)

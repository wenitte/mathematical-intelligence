Theorem
Let $G$ be a group whose identity is $e$.
Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.

Then:

$H = H e$
where $H e$ is the right coset of $H$ by $e$.


Proof
We have:














\(\ds H e\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \set {x \in G: \exists h \in H: x = h e}\)





Definition of Right Coset of $H$ by $e$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \set {x \in G: \exists h \in H: x = h}\)





Definition of Identity Element














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \set {x \in G: x \in H}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds H\)










So $H = H e$.
$\blacksquare$

This is consistent with the definition of the concept of coset by means of the subset product:

$H e = H \set e$

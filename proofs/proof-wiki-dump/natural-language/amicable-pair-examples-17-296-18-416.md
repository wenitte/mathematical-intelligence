Example of Amicable Pair
$17 \, 296$ and $18 \, 416$ are the $8$th amicable pair:

$\map {\sigma_1} {17 \, 296} = \map {\sigma_1} {18 \, 416} = 35 \, 712 = 17 \, 296 + 18 \, 416$


Proof
By definition, $m$ and $n$ form an amicable pair if and only if:

$\map {\sigma_1} m = \map {\sigma_1} n = m + n$
where $\sigma_1$ denotes the divisor sum function.

Thus:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {17 \, 296}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 35 \, 712\)





$\sigma_1$ of $17 \, 296$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 17 \, 296 + 18 \, 416\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {18 \, 416}\)





$\sigma_1$ of $18 \, 416$



$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The amicable pair $17 \, 296$ and $18 \, 416$ were discovered by Pierre de Fermat in $1636$.
As such, it appears that he re-discovered what had previously been discovered by the medieval Arab school.
It was, however, the second amicable pair to be known of by the Western mathematical world after $220$ and $284$, known of old.

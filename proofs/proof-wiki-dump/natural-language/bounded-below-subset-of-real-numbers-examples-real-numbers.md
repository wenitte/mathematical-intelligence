Example of Unbounded Below Subset of Real Numbers
Let $\R$ denote the set of real numbers.
$\R$ is not bounded below.


Proof
Let $x \in \R$.
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $\R$ is bounded below.
Then there exists $x \in \R$ such that $x$ is a lower bound for $\R$.
But then:

$x - 1 \in \R$ such that $x - 1 < x$
and so $x$ is not a lower bound for $\R$.
Hence by Proof by Contradiction $x$ is not a lower bound for $\R$.
$\blacksquare$

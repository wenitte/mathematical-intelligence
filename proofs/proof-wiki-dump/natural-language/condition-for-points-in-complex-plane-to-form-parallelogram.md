Theorem
Let $A = z_1$, $B = z_2$, $C = z_3$ and $D = z_4$ represent on the complex plane the vertices of a quadrilateral.

Then $ABCD$ is a parallelogram if and only if:

$z_1 - z_2 + z_3 - z_4 = 0$


Proof


$ABCD$ is a parallelogram if and only if:

$\vec {AB} = \vec {DC}$
Then:














\(\ds \vec {AB}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \vec {DC}\)

\(\ds z_2 - z_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds z_3 - z_4\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds z_1 - z_2 + z_3 - z_4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)

Examples
$2 + i$, $3 + 2 i$, $2 + 3 i$, $1 + 2 i$ form Square
The points in the complex plane represented by the complex numbers:

$2 + i, 3 + 2 i, 2 + 3 i, 1 + 2 i$
are the vertices of a square.

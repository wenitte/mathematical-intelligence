Examples of Consecutive Pairs of Quadratic Residues
There is $1$ consecutive pair of quadratic residues modulo $5$.
This is consistent with the number of such consecutive pairs being $\floor {\dfrac 5 4}$.


Proof
From Quadratic Residues modulo $5$:

$4$ and $1$ are quadratic residue
$2$ and $3$ are not quadratic residues.
In this context $4$ and $1$ are considered a pair of consecutive quadratic residues.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

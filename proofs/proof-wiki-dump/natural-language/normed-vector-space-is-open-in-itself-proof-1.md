Theorem
Let $M = \struct{X, \norm {\, \cdot \,}}$ be a normed vector space.

Then the set $X$ is an open set of $M$.


Proof
By definition, an open set $S \subseteq A$ is one where every point inside it is an element of an open ball contained entirely within that set.
Let $x \in X$.
An open ball of $x$ in $M$ is by definition a subset of $X$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

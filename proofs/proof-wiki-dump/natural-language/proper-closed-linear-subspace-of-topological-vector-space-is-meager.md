Theorem
Let $\GF \in \set {\R, \C}$.
Let $X$ be a topological vector space over $\GF$. 
Let $D$ be a proper closed linear subspace of $X$.

Then $D$ is meager.


Proof
From Set is Closed iff Equals Topological Closure, we have $D^- = D$. 
From Proper Linear Subspace of Topological Vector Space has Empty Interior, we then have that $\paren {D^-}^\circ = D^\circ = \O$. 
Hence $D$ is nowhere dense, and in particular meager.
$\blacksquare$

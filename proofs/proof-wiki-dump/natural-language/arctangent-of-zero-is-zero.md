Theorem
$\arctan 0 = 0$


Proof
By definition, $\arctan$ is the inverse of the tangent function's restriction to $\openint {-\dfrac \pi 2} {\dfrac \pi 2}$. 
By Tangent of Zero:

$\tan 0 = 0$
As $0 \in \openint {-\dfrac \pi 2} {\dfrac \pi 2}$, we have $\arctan 0 = 0$ by the definition of an inverse function.
$\blacksquare$

Seven men agreed to subscribe towards a certain fund,
and the first six gave $\pounds 10$ each.
The other man gave $\pounds 3$ more than the average of the seven.
What amount did the seventh man subscribe?


Solution
$\pounds 13, 10 \shillings$


Proof
Let $T$ be the total amount subscribed.
Let $S$ be the amount contributed by the seventh man.
Then:














\(\ds T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60 + S\)





... the first six gave $\pounds 10$ each














\(\ds S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac T 7 + 3\)





The other man gave $\pounds 3$ more than the average of the seven














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {60 + S} 7 + 3\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 7 S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60 + S + 21\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 81\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13 \tfrac 1 2\)









$\blacksquare$

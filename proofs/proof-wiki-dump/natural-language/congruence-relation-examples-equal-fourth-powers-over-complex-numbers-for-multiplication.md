Example of Congruence Relation
Let $\C$ denote the set of complex numbers.
Let $\RR$ denote the equivalence relation on $\C$ defined as:

$\forall w, z \in \C: z \mathrel \RR w \iff z^4 = w^4$
Then $\RR$ is a congruence relation for multiplication on $\C$.


Proof
Note that by Equivalence Relation Examples: Equal Fourth Powers over Complex Numbers, $\RR$ is an equivalence relation.
It remains to be shown that it is a congruence.

Let $w_1, w_2, z_1, z_2 \in \C$ such that:

$\paren {w_1 \mathrel \RR z_1} \land \paren {z_1 \mathrel \RR z_2}$
Then:














\(\ds w_1^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds w_2^4\)


















\(\, \ds \land \, \)

\(\ds z_1^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds z_2^4\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds w_1^4 \times z_1^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds w_2^4 \times z_2^4\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {w_1 \times z_1}^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {w_2 \times z_2}^4\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds w_1 \times z_1\)

\(\RR\)







\(\ds w_2 \times z_2\)

Theorem
Let $G$ be a group with identity $e$.
Let $G'$ be the derived subgroup of $G$.

Then:

$G'$ is the trivial group $\set e$
if and only if:

$G$ is abelian.


Proof
Sufficient Condition
This is proved in Derived Subgroup of Abelian Group is Trivial.
$\Box$


Necessary Condition
This is proved in Group whose Derived Subgroup is Trivial is Abelian.

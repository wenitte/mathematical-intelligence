Theorem
Let $x$ and $y$ be elements of either the real numbers $\R$ or the complex numbers $\C$.
Then:

$\size {x + y} \ge \size {\size x - \size y}$
where $\size x$ denotes either the absolute value of a real number or the complex modulus of a complex number.


Proof
Let $x$ and $y$ be elements of either the real numbers $\R$ or the complex numbers $\C$.
Let $z := -y$.

Then we have:














\(\ds \size {x - z}\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds \size {\size x - \size z}\)





Reverse Triangle Inequality for Real and Complex Fields














\(\ds \size {x - \paren {-y} }\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds \size {\size x - \size {-y} }\)





Definition of $z$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \size {x + y}\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds \size {\size x - \size {-y} }\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \size {x + y}\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds \size {\size x - \size y}\)





as $\size y = \size {-y}$



Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

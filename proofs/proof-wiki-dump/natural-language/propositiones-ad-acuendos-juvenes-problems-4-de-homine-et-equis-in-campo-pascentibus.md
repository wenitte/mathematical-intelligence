Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $4$
De Homine et Equis in Campo Pascentibus
Some Horses Grazing
A man saw some horses at pasture and wished they were his,
and that there were others with them that were his,
the same number again,
plus a quarter of the sum that would result,
for then he would glory in $100$ horses.
How many did the man see at pasture?


Solution
$40$.


Proof
Let $x$ be the number seen at pasture.
Then we have:

$x + x + \dfrac {x + x} 4 = 100$
That is, after algebra:

$\dfrac {10 x} 4 = 100$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

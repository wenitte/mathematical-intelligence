Theorem
Let $z \in \C$ be a complex number.
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$ be a (strictly) positive integer.
Let $z^n$ denote $z$ raised to the $n$th power.

Then both the real part $\map \Re {z^n}$ and the imaginary part $\map \Im {z^n}$ of $z^n$ are harmonic polynomials.


Proof
Real Part of Integer Power of Complex Number is Harmonic
Let $z \in \C$ be a complex number.
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$ be a (strictly) positive integer.
Let $z^n$ denote $z$ raised to the $n$th power.

Then the real part $\map \Re {z^n}$ of $z^n$ is a harmonic polynomial.
$\Box$


Imaginary Part of Integer Power of Complex Number is Harmonic
Let $z \in \C$ be a complex number.
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$ be a (strictly) positive integer.
Let $z^n$ denote $z$ raised to the $n$th power.

Then the imaginary part $\map \Im {z^n}$ of $z^n$ is a harmonic polynomial.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $A$ be the set of all real sequences $\sequence {x_i}$ such that the series $\ds \sum_{i \mathop \ge 0} x_i^2$ is convergent.
Let $\ell^2 = \struct {A, d_2}$ be the Hilbert sequence space on $\R$.

Then $\ell^2$ is not $\sigma$-compact.


Proof
By Compact Subset of Hilbert Sequence Space is Nowhere Dense, a compact subset of $\ell^2$ is nowhere dense in $\ell^2$.
We have that Hilbert Sequence Space is Complete Metric Space.
Hence $\ell^2$ is non-meager.

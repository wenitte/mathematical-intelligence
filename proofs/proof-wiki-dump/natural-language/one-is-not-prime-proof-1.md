Theorem
The integer $1$ (one) is not a prime number.


Proof
By definition, a prime number is a positive integer which has exactly $2$ divisors which are themselves positive integers.
From Divisors of One, the only divisors of $1$ are $1$ and $-1$.
So the only divisor of $1$ which is a positive integer is $1$.
As $1$ has only one such divisor, it is not classified as a prime number.
$\blacksquare$

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $9$
Pocket-Money
"When I got to the station this morning," said Harold Tompkins, at his club, "I found I was short of cash.
I spend just one-half of what I had on my railway ticket, and then bought a penny newspaper.
When I got to the terminus I spent half of what I had left and twopence more on a telegram.
Then I spent half of the remainder on a bus, and gave threepence to that old match-seller outside the club.
Consequently I arrive here with this single penny.
Now, how much did I start out with?"


Solution
$3 \shillings 6 \oldpence$


Proof
Tompkins ended up with $1 \oldpence$
Before he paid $3 \oldpence$ to the matchseller, he had $4 \oldpence$
Before spending half of what he had on a bus, he had $8 \oldpence$
Before spending $2 \oldpence$ on a telegram he had $10 \oldpence$
Before spending half of what he had left, he had $20 \oldpence$
Before buying a penny newspaper, he had $21 \oldpence$
Before spending half of what he had on a train ticket, he had $42 \oldpence$
That is, he started with $3 \shillings 6 \oldpence$
$\blacksquare$

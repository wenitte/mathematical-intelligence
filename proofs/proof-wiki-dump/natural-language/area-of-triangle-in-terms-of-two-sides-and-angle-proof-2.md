Theorem
The area of a triangle $ABC$ is given by:

$\dfrac 1 2 a b \sin C$
where:

$a, b$ are two of the sides
$C$ is the angle of the vertex opposite its other side $c$.


Proof

By definition of sine:

$h = b \sin C$
From Area of Triangle in Terms of Side and Altitude:

$\map \Area {ABC} = \dfrac {a h} 2$
Substituting:

$\map \Area {ABC} = \dfrac {a b \sin C} 2$
$\blacksquare$

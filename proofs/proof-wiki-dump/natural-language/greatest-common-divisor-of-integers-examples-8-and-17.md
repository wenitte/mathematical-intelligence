Example of Greatest Common Divisor of Integers
The greatest common divisor of $8$ and $17$ is:

$\gcd \set {8, 17} = 1$
That is, $8$ and $17$ are coprime.


Proof
The strictly positive divisors of $8$ are:

$\set {x \in \Z_{>0}: x \divides 8} = \set {1, 2, 4, 8}$
The strictly positive divisors of $17$ are:

$\set {x \in \Z_{>0}: x \divides 17} = \set {1, 17}$
It is seen that there is only one strictly positive common divisor of $8$ and $17$, and that is $1$.
Hence by definition $8$ and $17$ are coprime.
$\blacksquare$

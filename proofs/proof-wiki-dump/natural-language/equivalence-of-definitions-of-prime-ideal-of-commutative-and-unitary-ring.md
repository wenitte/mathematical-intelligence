Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Prime Ideal of Commutative and Unitary Ring are equivalent:

Definition 1
A prime ideal of $R$ is a proper ideal $P$ such that:

$\forall a, b \in R : a \circ b \in P \implies a \in P$ or $b \in P$
Definition 2
A prime ideal of $R$ is a proper ideal $P$ of $R$ such that:

$I \circ J \subseteq P \implies I \subseteq P \text { or } J \subseteq P$
for all ideals $I$ and $J$ of $R$.

Definition 3
A prime ideal of $R$ is a proper ideal $P$ of $R$ such that:

the complement $R \setminus P$ of $P$ in $R$ is closed under the ring product $\circ$.


Proof
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a commutative and unitary ring throughout.

$(1)$ implies $(2)$
Let $P$ be a prime ideal of $R$ by definition 1.
Then by definition:

$\forall a, b \in R : a \circ b \in P \implies a \in P$ or $b \in P$
Let $I \circ J \subseteq P$.
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose that both $I \nsubseteq P$ and $J \nsubseteq P$.
Then by definition of subset:

$\exists a \in I \setminus P, b \in J \setminus P$
But by definition of subset product

$a \circ b \in P$ as $I \circ J \subseteq P$
Thus we have $a, b \in P$ such that:

$a \circ b \in P$ where $a \notin P$ and $b \notin P$
But this contradicts the criterion for $P$ to be a prime ideal of $R$ by definition 1
Thus by Proof by Contradiction, either $I \subseteq P$ or $J \subseteq P$,
Thus $P$ is a prime ideal of $R$ by definition 2.
$\Box$


$(2)$ implies $(1)$
Let $P$ be a prime ideal of $R$ by definition 2.
Then by definition:

$I \circ J \subseteq P \implies I \subseteq P \text { or } J \subseteq P$
for all ideals $I$ and $J$ of $R$.
Let $a, b \in R$ such that $a \circ b \in P$.
Consider $\ideal a$ and $\ideal b$, the ideals generated by $a$ and $b$.
Let $r \in \ideal a, s \in \ideal b$. 
Then:

$\exists m, n \in R: r = m \circ a, s = n \circ b$
Therefore:














\(\ds r \circ s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {m \circ a} \circ \paren {n \circ b}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {m \circ n} \circ \paren {a \circ b}\)





Definition of Commutative Ring














\(\ds \)

\(\in\)







\(\ds P\)





Definition of Ideal of Ring: $m \circ n \in R$, $a \circ b \in P$



This shows that $\ideal a \circ \ideal b \subseteq P$.
By definition 2, $\ideal a \subseteq P$ or $\ideal b \subseteq P$.
This implies $a \in P$ or $b \in P$.
Thus $P$ is a prime ideal of $R$ by definition 1.
$\Box$


$(1)$ implies $(3)$
Let $P$ be a prime ideal of $R$ by definition 1.
Then by definition:

$\forall a, b \in R : a \circ b \in P \implies a \in P$ or $b \in P$
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $R \setminus P$ is not multiplicatively closed.
That is:










\(\ds \exists a, b \in R \setminus P: \, \)



\(\ds a \circ b\)

\(\notin\)







\(\ds R \setminus P\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a \circ b\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds P\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds P\)


















\(\, \ds \lor \, \)

\(\ds b\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds P\)










But this contradicts the assertion that $a, b \in R \setminus P$.
Thus by Proof by Contradiction $R \setminus P$ is multiplicatively closed.
Thus $P$ is a prime ideal of $R$ by definition 3.
$\Box$


$(3)$ implies $(1)$
Let $P$ be a prime ideal of $R$ by definition 3.
Then by definition:

the complement $R \setminus P$ of $P$ in $R$ is closed under the ring product $\circ$.
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose let $a \circ b \in P$ such that $a \notin P$ and $b \notin P$.
Then:

$a, b \in R \setminus P$
by definition of relative complement.
But $R \setminus P$ is closed under the ring product $\circ$.
That means:

$\forall a, b \in R \setminus P \implies a \circ b \in R \setminus P $
But this contradicts the assertion that $a \circ b \in P$.
Thus by Proof by Contradiction either $a \in P$ or $b \in P$ (or both).
Thus $P$ is a prime ideal of $R$ by definition 1.

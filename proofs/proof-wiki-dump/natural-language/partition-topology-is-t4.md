Corollary to Partition Topology is T5
Let $S$ be a set and let $\PP$ be a partition on $S$ which is not the (trivial) partition of singletons.
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be the partition space whose basis is $\PP$.

Then:

$T$ is a $T_4$ space.


Proof
We have that the Partition Topology is $T_5$.
We also have that a $T_5$ Space is $T_4$ Space.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Examples of Minimal Elements
Let $\FF$ denote the set of finite subsets of the natural numbers $\N$.
Consider the ordered set $\struct {\FF, \subseteq}$.
There is one minimal element of $\struct {\FF, \subseteq}$, and that is the empty set $\O$.


Proof
We have that $\O$ is a finite set.
By Empty Set is Subset of All Sets it follows that $\O$ is a subset of $\N$.
Hence $\O \in \FF$ by definition of $\FF$.

Let $A \in \FF$ be some finite subset of $\N$ such that $A \subseteq \O$.
Then by Subset of Empty Set iff Empty:

$A = \O$
Hence $\O$ is a minimal element of $\struct {\FF, \subseteq}$ by definition.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Every group whose order is less than $60$ is solvable.


Proof
A direct consequence of Burnside's Theorem: the smallest number with $3$ distinct prime factors is $2 \times 3 \times 5 = 60$.


The validity of the material on this page is questionable.In particular: But $2 \times 3 \times 5 = 30$ not $60$.

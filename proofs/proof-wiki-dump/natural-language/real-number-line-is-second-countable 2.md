Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.

Then $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ is second-countable.


Proof
From Countable Basis of Real Number Line we have that $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ has a countable basis.
The result follows directly from the definition of a second-countable space.
$\blacksquare$

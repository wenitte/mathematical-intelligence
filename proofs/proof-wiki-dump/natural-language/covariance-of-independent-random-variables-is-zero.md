Theorem
Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent random variables.
Let the expectations of $X$ and $Y$ exist and be finite. 
Then the covariance of $X$ and $Y$ is $0$. 


Proof













\(\ds \cov {X, Y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \expect {X Y} - \expect X \expect Y\)





Covariance as Expectation of Product minus Product of Expectations














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \expect X \expect Y - \expect X \expect Y\)





Condition for Independence from Product of Expectations














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)









$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a compact space.

Then $T$ is a weakly $\sigma$-locally compact space.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a compact space.
We have that:

Compact Space is Sigma-Compact
Compact Space is Weakly Locally Compact
Hence by definition $T$ is weakly $\sigma$-locally compact space.
$\blacksquare$

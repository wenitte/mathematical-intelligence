Theorem
Let $X$ be a topological space. 
Let $fÂ : X \to \R$ be a real-valued function vanishing at infinity.
Let $f^-$ be the negative part of $f$. 

Then $f^-$ vanishes at infinity.


Proof
From Negative Part of Function Bounded above by Absolute Value, we have:

$0 \le f^- \le \cmod f$
From Complex-Valued Function Dominated by Function Vanishing at Infinity also Vanishes at Infinity:

$f^-$ vanishes at infinity.
$\blacksquare$

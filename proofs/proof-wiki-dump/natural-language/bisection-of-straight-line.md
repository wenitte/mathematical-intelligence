Theorem
It is possible to bisect a straight line segment.

In the words of Euclid:

To bisect a given finite straight line.
(The Elements: Book $\text{I}$: Proposition $10$)


Construction

Let $AB$ be the given straight line segment.

We construct an equilateral triangle $\triangle ABC$ on $AB$.
We bisect the angle $\angle ACB$ by the straight line segment $CD$.

Then $AB$ has been bisected at the point $D$.


Proof
As $\triangle ABC$ is an equilateral triangle, it follows that $AC = CB$.
The two triangles $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle BCD$ have side $CD$ in common, and side $AC$ of $\triangle ACD$ equals side $BC$ of $\triangle BCD$.
The angle $\angle ACD$ subtended by lines $AC$ and $CD$ equals the angle $\angle BCD$ subtended by lines $BC$ and $CD$, as $\angle ACB$ was bisected.
So triangles $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle BCD$ are equal.
Therefore $AD = DB$.

So $AB$ has been bisected at the point $D$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $10$ of Book $\text{I}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Theorem
Let $C$ be a cycloid generated by the equations:

$x = a \paren {\theta - \sin \theta}$
$y = a \paren {1 - \cos \theta}$
Then the length of one arc of the cycloid is $8 a$.


Proof 1
Let $L$ be the length of one arc of the cycloid.
From Arc Length for Parametric Equations:

$\ds L = \int_0^{2 \pi} \sqrt {\paren {\frac {\d x} {\d \theta} }^2 + \paren {\frac {\d y} {\d \theta} }^2} \rd \theta$
where, from Equation of Cycloid:

$x = a \paren {\theta - \sin \theta}$
$y = a \paren {1 - \cos \theta}$
we have:














\(\ds \frac {\d x} {\d \theta}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \paren {1 - \cos \theta}\)




















\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d \theta}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \sin \theta\)









Thus:














\(\ds \paren {\frac {\d x} {\d \theta} }^2 + \paren {\frac {\d y} {\d \theta} }^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2 \paren {\paren {1 - \cos \theta}^2 + \sin^2 \theta}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2 \paren {1 - 2 \cos \theta + \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 a^2 \paren {1 - \cos \theta}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 a^2 \map {\sin^2} {\theta / 2}\)





Half Angle Formula for Sine




Thus:














\(\ds L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \int_0^{2 \pi} 2 a \map \sin {\theta / 2} \rd \theta\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \bigintlimits {-4 a \map \cos {\theta / 2} } 0 {2 \pi}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8 a\)










So $L = 8 a$ where $a$ is the radius of the generating circle.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Consider the tangent $PQ$ to both the generating circle and the cycloid itself.

$PR = 2 PQ$
In the limit, where $P$ is at the cusp, the tangent $PQ$ is perpendicular to the straight line along which the generating circle rolls.
At this point:

$PQ = 2 a$.
Thus at this point:

$PR = 4 a$
But $4 a$ is half the length of one arc of $C$.
Hence the result.

Historical Note
The geometric proof of the length of the arc of a cycloid was demonstrated by Christopher Wren in $1658$.

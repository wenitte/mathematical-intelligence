Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite group of order $n$.
Let $g \in G$ have order $n$.

Then $G$ is a cyclic group which is generated by $g$.


Proof
The subgroup of $G$ generated by $g$ is:

$\gen g = \set {g^0, g^1, g^2, \ldots, g^{n - 1} }$
This contains $n$ elements.
Thus:

$\gen g = G$
and the result follows by definition of cyclic group.

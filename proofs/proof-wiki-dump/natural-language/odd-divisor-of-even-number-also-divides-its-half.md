Theorem
Let $a, b \in \Z$ be integers.
Let $a$ be odd and $b$ be even.
Let:

$a \divides b$
where $\divides$ denotes divisibility.

Then:

$a \divides \dfrac b 2$

In the words of Euclid:

If an odd number measure an even number, it will also measure the half of it.
(The Elements: Book $\text{IX}$: Proposition $30$)


Proof
By definition of an even number:

$\exists r \in \Z: b = 2 r$
By definition of an odd number:

$\exists s \in \Z: a = 2 s + 1$
Thus:

$a \divides 2 \iff a = \pm 1$
in which case from One Divides all Integers:

$a \divides \dfrac b 2$
We have that:

$a \divides 2 r$
and so by Euclid's Lemma:

$a \divides r = \dfrac b 2$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $30$ of Book $\text{IX}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

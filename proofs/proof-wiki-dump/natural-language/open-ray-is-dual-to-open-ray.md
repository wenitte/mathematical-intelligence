Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be a totally ordered set.
Let $R$ be an open ray in $\struct {S, \preceq}$.

Then $R$ is an open ray in $\struct {S, \succeq}$, where $\succeq$ is the dual ordering of $\preceq$.


Proof
By the definition of open ray, there is some $p \in S$ such that:

$R$ is the strict upper or strict lower closure of $p$ with respect to $\preceq$.
By Strict Lower Closure is Dual to Strict Upper Closure, the dual statement is:

$R$ is the strict upper or strict lower closure of $p$ with respect to $\succeq$.
Thus $R$ is an open ray in $\struct {S, \succeq}$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The set of integers under multiplication $\struct {\Z, \times}$ is a monoid.


Proof
From Integers under Multiplication form Semigroup, $\struct {\Z, \times}$ is a semigroup.
From Integer Multiplication Identity is One, $\struct {\Z, \times}$ has an identity element, which is $1$.
All the criteria for being a monoid are thus seen to be fulfilled.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a compact Hausdorff space.

Then $T$ is a $T_4$ space.


Proof
We have that a Compact Subspace of Hausdorff Space is Closed.
We also have that a Closed Subspace of Compact Space is Compact.
We also have that Disjoint Compact Sets in Hausdorff Space have Disjoint Neighborhoods.
$T$ is a $T_4$ space when any two disjoint closed subsets of $S$ are separated by neighborhoods.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

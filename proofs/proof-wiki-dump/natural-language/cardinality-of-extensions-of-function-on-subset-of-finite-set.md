Theorem
Let $m, n \in \Z_{>0}$ be (strictly) positive integers.
Let $S$ be a set with $m$ elements.
Let $T$ be a set with $n$ elements.
Let $A$ be a subset of $S$ with $r$ elements where $0 \le r < m$.
Let $f: A \to T$ be a mapping.

Then there are $n^{m - r}$ distinct extensions of $f$ to $S$.


Proof
Let $N$ denote the number of distinct extensions of $f$ to $S$.
The question is equivalent to asking the number of distinct mappings from $S \setminus A$ to $T$.
There are $m - r$ elements in $S \setminus A$.
Hence from Cardinality of Set of All Mappings:

$N = n^{m - r}$
$\blacksquare$

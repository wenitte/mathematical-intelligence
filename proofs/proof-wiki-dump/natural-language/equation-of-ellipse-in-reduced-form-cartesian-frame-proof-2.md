Theorem
Let $K$ be an ellipse aligned in a cartesian plane in reduced form.

Let:

the major axis of $K$ have length $2 a$
the minor axis of $K$ have length $2 b$.

The equation of $K$ is:

$\dfrac {x^2} {a^2} + \dfrac {y^2} {b^2} = 1$


Proof


Let $P$ be an arbitrary point in the plane.
Let $PM$ be dropped perpendicular to $V_1 V_2$.
Hence $M = \tuple {x, 0}$.
From Intersecting Chord Theorem for Conic Sections:

$PM^2 = k V_1 M \times M V_2$
for some constant $k$.
Hence:














\(\ds y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds k \paren {a + x} \paren {a - x}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds k \paren {a^2 - x^2}\)









Putting $x = 0$, we find the points where $K$ crosses the $y$-axis are defined by:

$y^2 = k a^2$
This gives us:

$k a^2 = b^2$
and so:














\(\ds y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {b^2} {a^2} \paren {a^2 - x^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds b^2 - x^2 \dfrac {b^2} {a^2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {y^2} {b^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 - \dfrac {x^2} {a^2}\)









Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

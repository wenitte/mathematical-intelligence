Theorem
Let $G$ be a group of order $30$.
Let $G$ have the group presentation:

$\gen {x, y: x^{15} = e = y^2, y x y^{-1} = x^{11} }$

Then $G$ is isomorphic to the group direct product of the cyclic group $C_5$ and the dihedral group $D_3$:

$G \cong C_5 \times D_3$


Proof
Let $G$ be defined by its group presentation:

$G = \gen {x, y: x^{15} = e = y^2, y x y^{-1} = x^{11} }$

Let $z$ denote $x^3$.
Then:

\(\ds y z\)

\(\ds z y\)





Product of both sides with $y$



So $z$ commutes with $y$.
As $z$ is a power of $x$, $z$ also commutes with $x$.
Hence by definition of center:

$z \in \map Z G$
It follows that $\gen z$ is a normal subgroup of order $5$.

Let $K$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by $x^5$ and $y$.
Note that:

as $x^{15} = e$



Hence the generator of $K$ satisfies:

$\paren{x^5}^3 = e = y^2$
and:

$y x^5 y^{-1} = x^{-5}$
Let $w := x^5$.
Then $K$ is generated by $w$ and $y$ where:

$w^3 = 1 = y^2$
and:

$w y = y w^2 = y w^{-1}$
and it is seen that $K$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group $D_3$.

It is now to be shown that $G$ is an internal group direct product of $K$ and $\gen z$.
We have that $K \cap \gen z = \set e$.
From the Internal Direct Product Theorem, we need to prove only that $K$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
We have that:

$\order K = 6$
where $\order K$ denotes the order of $K$.
We also have that $K$ is a subgroup of its normalizer $\map {N_G} K$.
Hence by Lagrange's Theorem:

$6 \divides \order {\map {N_G} K}$
where $\divides$ denotes divisibility.
Again by Lagrange's Theorem:

$\order {\map {N_G} K} \divides 30$

We have:














\(\ds x w x^{-1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x x^5 x^{-1}\)





Definition of $w$














\(\ds \)

demonstrating that $x$ is conjugate to $w$.

Then:

\(\ds x y^{-1} x^{-1}\)





as $y^2 = e$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds y x^{11} x^{-1}\)

\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds y x^{10}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds y w^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\in\)







\(\ds K\)









demonstrating that $x$ is conjugate to $y$.

Thus $x \in \map {N_G} K$ and so $\order {\map {N_G} K} > 6$.
As $6 \divides \order {\map {N_G} K}$ and $\order {\map {N_G} K} \divides 30$, it follows that:

$\map {N_G} K = G$
and so $K$ is normal in $G$.

Thus:

$K$ and $\gen z$ are normal in $G$
$K \cap \gen z = \set e$
$K \gen z = G$
and it therefore follows from the  Internal Direct Product Theorem that:

$G = C_5 \times D_3$
$\blacksquare$

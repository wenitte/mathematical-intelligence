Porism to Greatest Common Measure of Commensurable Magnitudes
In the words of Euclid:

From this it is manifest that, if a magnitude measure two magnitudes, it will also measure their greatest common measure.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $3$ : Porism)


Proof
Apparent from the construction.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $3$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

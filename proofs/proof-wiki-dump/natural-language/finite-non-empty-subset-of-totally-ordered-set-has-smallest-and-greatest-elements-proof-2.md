Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be a totally ordered set.
Then every finite $T$ such that $\O \subset T \subseteq S$ has both a smallest and a greatest element.


Proof
The result follows from:

Finite Non-Empty Subset of Ordered Set has Maximal and Minimal Elements
Minimal Element of Chain is Smallest Element
Maximal Element of Chain is Greatest Element
$\blacksquare$

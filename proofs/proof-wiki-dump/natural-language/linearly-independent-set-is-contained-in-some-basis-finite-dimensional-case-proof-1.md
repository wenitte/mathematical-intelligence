Theorem
Let $E$ be a vector space of $n$ dimensions.
Let $H$ be a linearly independent subset of $E$.
There exists a basis $B$ for $E$ such that $H \subseteq B$.


Proof
By hypothesis there is a basis $B$ of $E$ with $n$ elements.
Then $H \cup B$ is a generator for $E$.
So by Vector Space has Basis Between Linearly Independent Set and Finite Spanning Set there exists a basis $C$ of $E$ such that $H \subseteq C \subseteq H \cup B$.
$\blacksquare$

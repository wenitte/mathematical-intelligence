Example of Euler Lucky Number
The expression:

$n^2 + n + 5$
yields primes for $n = 0$ to $n = 3$.

This demonstrates that $5$ is a Euler lucky number.


Proof













\(\ds 0^2 + 0 + 5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0 + 0 + 5\)

\(\ds = 5\)



which is prime














\(\ds 1^2 + 1 + 5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 + 1 + 5\)

\(\ds = 7\)



which is prime














\(\ds 2^2 + 2 + 5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 + 2 + 5\)

\(\ds = 11\)



which is prime














\(\ds 3^2 + 3 + 5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 + 3 + 5\)

\(\ds = 17\)



which is prime

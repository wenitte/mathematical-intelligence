Theorem
Let $L = \struct {S, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a bounded below arithmetic lattice.
Let $p \in S$.

Then if $p$ is pseudoprime element, then $p$ is prime element.


Proof
By Arithmetic iff Way Below Relation is Multiplicative in Algebraic Lattice:

$\ll$ is a multiplicative relation.
Thus by Way Below Relation is Multiplicative implies Pseudoprime Element is Prime:

the result holds.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $\struct {\map \Gamma G, \circ}$ be the symmetric group on $G$.
Let $\Inn G$ denote the inner automorphism group of $G$.

Then:

$\Inn G \le \struct {\map \Gamma G, \circ}$
where $\le$ denotes the relation of being a subgroup.


Proof
An inner automorphism is a permutation on $G$ by definition.
From Inner Automorphisms form Subgroup of Automorphism Group:

$\Inn G \le \Aut G$
where $\Aut G$ denotes the set of automorphisms of $G$.
From Automorphism Group is Subgroup of Symmetric Group:

$\Aut G \le \struct {\map \Gamma G, \circ}$
Thus $\Inn G \le \struct {\map \Gamma G, \circ}$ as required.
$\blacksquare$

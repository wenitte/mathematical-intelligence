Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\struct {\map \Gamma S, \circ}$ be the symmetric group on $S$, where $\circ$ denotes the composition operation.
Let $\struct {H, \circ}$ be a set of permutations of $S$ which forms a group under $\circ$.

Then $\struct {H, \circ}$ is a subgroup of $\struct {\map \Gamma S, \circ}$.


Proof
Follows directly from the definition of subgroup:
$H$ is a subset of $\map \Gamma S$, and $\struct {H, \circ}$ is a group.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

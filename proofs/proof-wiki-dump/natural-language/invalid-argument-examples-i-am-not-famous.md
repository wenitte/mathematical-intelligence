Example of Invalid Argument
The following is an invalid argument with true premises and a true conclusion:

If I am President then I am famous.
I am not President.
Therefore I am not famous.


Proof
This is an example of Denying the Antecedent.
It does not follow that just because I am not President then I am not famous.
The fact that I am indeed not famous is independent of the argument.
$\blacksquare$

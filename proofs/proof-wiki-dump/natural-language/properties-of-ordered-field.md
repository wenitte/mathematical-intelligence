Theorem
Let $\struct {F, +, \cdot}$ be an ordered field with unity $1$, zero $0$.
Denote the strict order by $<$ and the weak order by $\le$.
Let $\Char F$ denote the characteristic of $F$.
Then the following hold for all $x, y, z \in F$:

$(1): \quad x < 0 \iff -x > 0$
$(2): \quad x > y \iff x - y > 0$
$(3): \quad x < y \iff -x > -y$
$(4): \quad \paren {z < 0} \land \paren {x < y} \implies x z > y z$
$(5): \quad x \ne 0 \implies x^2 > 0$
$(6): \quad 1 > 0$
$(7): \quad \Char F = 0$
$(8): \quad x > y > 0 \iff y^{-1} > x^{-1} > 0$


Proof
By definition of ordering, the relation $\le$ is:

reflexive
transitive
antisymmetric
and furthermore, every pair of elements is comparable.
The order is compatible with $F$ in the sense that, for all $x, y, z, c \in F$:

$x < y \implies x + z < y + z$
$c > 0,\ x < y \implies c x < c y$
The proof is by repeated deduction from these properties.

$(4): \quad (z < 0) \land (x < y) \implies x z > y z$:
By parts 1 and 3 above, if $z < 0$, $x < y$ then $-z > 0$ and $-x > -y$.
Then:

$x z = \paren {-x} \paren {-z} > \paren {-y} \paren {-z} = y z$


$(5): \quad x \ne 0 \implies x^2 > 0$:
If $x > 0$, then:

$x^2 = x \cdot x > x \cdot 0 = 0$
If $x < 0$, then by 1, $-x > 0$, so:

$x^2 = \paren {-x} \cdot \paren {-x} > \paren {-x} \cdot 0 = 0$


$(6): \quad 1 > 0$:
This is immediate from $(5)$, noting that $1 = 1^2$ is a square.


$(7): \quad \Char F = 0$:
By $(6)$, we have:

$0 < 1 < 1 + 1 < 1 + 1 + 1 < \cdots$
so $n \cdot 1 \ne 0$ for all $n \in \N$.


$(8): \quad x > y > 0 \iff y^{-1} > x^{-1} > 0$:
First let $x > 0$.
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $x^{-1} < 0$.
Then by $(4)$:

$0 = 0 \cdot x^{-1} > x \cdot x^{-1} = 1$
which contradicts $(6)$, so $x^{-1} > 0$.
Now let $x > y > 0$.
Then:














\(\ds x^{-1} y^{-1} x\)

\(>\)







\(\ds x^{-1} y^{-1} y > 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y^{-1}\)

\(>\)







\(\ds x^{-1} > 0\)









The converse follows upon interchanging $x^{-1} \leftrightarrow x$ and $y^{-1} \leftrightarrow y$.

Theorem
Let $\phi_x$ denote the reflection in the plane whose axis is the $x$-axis.

Let $P = \tuple {x, y}$ be an arbitrary point in the plane
Then:

$\map {\phi_x} P = \tuple {x, -y}$


Proof
From Equations defining Plane Reflection:

$\map {\phi_\alpha} P = \tuple {x \cos 2 \alpha + y \sin 2 \alpha, x \sin 2 \alpha - y \cos 2 \alpha}$
where $\alpha$ denotes the angle between the axis and the $x$-axis.

By definition, the $x$-axis, being coincident with itself, is at a zero angle with itself.
Hence $\phi_x$ can be expressed as $\phi_\alpha$ in the above equations such that $\alpha = 0$.
Hence we have:














\(\ds \map {\phi_x} P\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {x \map \cos {2 \times 0} + y \map \sin {2 \times 0}, x \map \sin {2 \times 0} - y \map \cos {2 \times 0} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {x \cos 0 + y \sin 0, x \sin 0 - y \cos 0}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {x, -y}\)

Theorem
Let $T = \struct{S, \tau}$ be a sober space

Let $\Omega : \mathbf {Top} \to \mathbf {Loc}$ denote the locale of open sets functor.
Let $\operatorname {Sp} : \mathbf {Loc} \to \mathbf {Top}$ denote the spectrum functor.

Then:

$\map {\operatorname {Sp}} {\map \Omega T}$ is homeomorphic to $T$


Proof
$\blacksquare$

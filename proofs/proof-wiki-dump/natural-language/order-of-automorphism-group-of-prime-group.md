Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $G$ be a group of order $p$.
Let $\Aut G$ denote the automorphism group of $G$.

Then:

$\order {\Aut G} = p - 1$
where $\order {\, \cdot \,}$ denotes the order of a group.


Proof
From Prime Group is Cyclic we have that $G$ is a cyclic group.
From Order of Automorphism Group of Cyclic Group:

$\order {\Aut G} = \map \phi p$
where $\map \phi n$ denotes the Euler $\phi$ function.
The result follows from Euler Phi Function of Prime.

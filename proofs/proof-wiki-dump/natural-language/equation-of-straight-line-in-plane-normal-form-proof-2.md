Theorem
Let $\LL$ be a straight line such that:

the perpendicular distance from $\LL$ to the origin is $p$
the angle made between that perpendicular and the $x$-axis is $\alpha$.

Then $\LL$ can be defined by the equation:

$x \cos \alpha + y \sin \alpha = p$


Proof

Let $P = \tuple {x, y}$ be an arbitrary point on $\LL$.
Let $O$ be the origin of the Cartesian plane in which $\LL$ is embedded.
Let $PQ$ be the perpendicular dropped from $P$ to the $x$-axis.
Let $QS$ be the perpendicular dropped from $Q$ to the line $ON$.
Let $PR$ be the perpendicular dropped from $P$ to the line $QS$.
By definition of cosine:

$OS = OQ \cos \alpha$
By definition of sine:

$PR = PQ \sin \alpha$
Then:














\(\ds p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds ON\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds OS + SN\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds OS + PR\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds OQ \cos \alpha + PQ \sin \alpha\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds x \cos \alpha + y \sin \alpha\)









$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.
Let $\TT \subseteq \powerset S$ be a subset of $\powerset S$.

Then the greatest set of $\TT$, if it exists, must be unique.


Proof
Let $A, B \in \TT$ both be greatest sets of $\TT$.
Since $A$ is the greatest set:

$B \subseteq A$
Since $B$ is the greatest set:

$A \subseteq B$

Hence, by definition of set equality:

$A = B$
Therefore the greatest set of $\TT$ is unique.
$\blacksquare$

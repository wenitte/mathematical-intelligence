Example of Complex Addition
$\paren {-3 + 5 i} + \paren {4 + 2 i} + \paren {5 - 3 i} + \paren {-4 - 6 i} = 2 - 2 i$


Proof 1













\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \paren {-3 + 5 i} + \paren {4 + 2 i} + \paren {5 - 3 i} + \paren {-4 - 6 i}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\paren {-3} + 4 + 5 + \paren {-4} } + \paren {5 + 2 + \paren {-3} + \paren {-6} } i\)





Definition of Complex Addition














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 - 2 i\)









$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Let:














\(\ds z_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -3 + 5 i\)




















\(\ds z_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 + 2 i\)




















\(\ds z_3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 - 3 i\)




















\(\ds z_4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -4 - 6 i\)









These can be depicted in the complex plane as follows:



To find the required sum, proceed as in the following diagram:


Construct $z_2$ with its initial point placed at the terminal point of $z_1$.
Construct $z_3$ with its initial point placed at the terminal point of this instance of $z_2$.
Construct $z_4$ with its initial point placed at the terminal point of this instance of $z_3$.

The required resultant $z_1 + z_2 + z_3 + z_4$ of $z_1$ to $z_4$ is therefore represented by the terminal point of $z_4$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The closed-form expression for the $n$th heptagonal number is:

$H_n = \dfrac {n \paren {5 n - 3} } 2$


Proof
Heptagonal numbers are $k$-gonal numbers where $k = 7$.
From Closed Form for Polygonal Numbers we have that:

$\map P {k, n} = \dfrac n 2 \paren {\paren {k - 2} n - k + 4}$

Hence:














\(\ds H_n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac n 2 \paren {\paren {7 - 2} n - 7 + 4}\)





Closed Form for Polygonal Numbers














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {n \paren {5 n - 3} } 2\)









Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

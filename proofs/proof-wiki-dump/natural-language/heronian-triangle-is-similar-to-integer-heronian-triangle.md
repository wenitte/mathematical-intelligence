Theorem
Let $\triangle {ABC}$ be a Heronian triangle.
Then there exists an integer Heronian triangle $\triangle {A'B'C'}$ such that $\triangle {ABC}$ and $\triangle {A'B'C'}$ are similar.


Proof
Let $\triangle {ABC}$ have sides whose lengths are $a$, $b$ and $c$.
By definition of Heronian triangle, each of $a$, $b$ and $c$ are rational.
By definition of rational number, we can express:

$a = \dfrac {p_a} {q_a}$, $b = \dfrac {p_b} {q_b}$ and $c = \dfrac {p_c} {q_c}$
where each of $p_a, q_a, p_b, q_b, p_c, q_c$ are integers.

Now let:














\(\ds a'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a q_a q_b q_c\)




















\(\ds b'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b q_a q_b q_c\)




















\(\ds c'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c q_a q_b q_c\)









Let $\triangle {A'B'C'}$ be the triangle whose sides have lengths $a'$, $b'$ and $c'$.
By definition, $\triangle {ABC}$ and $\triangle {A'B'C'}$ are similar.
Each of $a'$, $b'$ and $c'$ are integers.
Consider the area of triangle $\triangle {A'B'C'}$
Let the area of $\triangle {ABC}$ be $A$.
Then the area $\triangle {A'B'C'}$ is $q_a q_b q_c A$, which is rational.
Hence $\triangle {A'B'C'}$ is an integer Heronian triangle.
$\blacksquare$

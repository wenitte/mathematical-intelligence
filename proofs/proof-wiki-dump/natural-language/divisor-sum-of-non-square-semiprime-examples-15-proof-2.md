Example of Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime
$\map {\sigma_1} {15} = 24$


Proof
We have that:

$15 = 3 \times 5$
and so by definition is a semiprime whose prime factors are distinct.

Hence:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {15}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {3 + 1} \paren {5 + 1}\)

\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 6\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 24\)

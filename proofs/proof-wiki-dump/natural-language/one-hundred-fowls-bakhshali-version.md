Problem
$20$ men, women and childen earn $20$ coins between them as follows:

Each man earns $3$ coins.
Each woman earns $1 \frac 1 2$ coins.
Each child earns $\frac 1 2$ a coin.
How many men, women and children are there?


Solution
$2$ men
$5$ women
$13$ children.


Proof
Let $m$, $w$ and $c$ denote the number of men, women and children respectively.
Then we have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds m + w + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)




















\(\ds 3 m + 1 \frac 1 2 w + \frac 1 2 c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 m + 3 w + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40\)





clearing the fractions








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 m + 2 w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)





$(2) - (1)$



We are of course subject to the condition that each of $m$, $w$ and $c$ is not fewer than $0$.
It is seen that $2 w$ is even.
Hence, in order for $5 m + 2 w$ also to be even, it is necessary for $m$ to be even.
If $m > 4$, then $5 m > 20$.
In that case $w < 0$ and so it must be that $m \le 4$.
This allows for $m$ to be equal to $0$, $2$ or $4$.
This gives the solutions:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)




















\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)














\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)




















\(\ds w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)




















\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13\)














\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4\)




















\(\ds w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16\)










However, let it be understood that there was at least one man, at least one woman and at least one child.
Then there is one solution remaining:

$2$ men
$5$ women
$13$ children.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
If the Bakhshali Manuscript actually dates from as long ago as the $3$rd century C.E., this is probably the oldest instance of a One Hundred Fowls problem in the world.

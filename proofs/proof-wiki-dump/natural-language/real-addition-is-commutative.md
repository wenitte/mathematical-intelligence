Theorem
The operation of addition on the set of real numbers $\R$ is commutative:

$\forall x, y \in \R: x + y = y + x$


Proof
From the definition, the real numbers are the set of all equivalence classes $\eqclass {\sequence {x_n} } {}$ of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers.

Let $x = \eqclass {\sequence {x_n} } {}, y = \eqclass {\sequence {y_n} } {}$, where $\eqclass {\sequence {x_n} } {}$ and $\eqclass {\sequence {y_n} } {}$ are such equivalence classes.

Thus:














\(\ds x + y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \eqclass {\sequence {x_n} } {} + \eqclass {\sequence {y_n} } {}\)





Definition of Real Number














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \eqclass {\sequence {x_n + y_n} } {}\)





Definition of Real Addition

\(=\)







\(\ds \eqclass {\sequence {y_n + x_n} } {}\)





Rational Addition is Commutative

Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle whose sides are $a$, $b$ and $c$ opposite vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively.
Then the area $\AA$ of $\triangle ABC$ is given by:

$\AA = \sqrt {r \rho_a \rho_b \rho_c}$
where:

$r$ is the inradius
$\rho_a$, $\rho_b$ and $\rho_c$ are the exradii of $\triangle ABC$ with respect to $a$, $b$ and $c$ respectively.

Theorem
Let $a, b \in \C$ be complex constants representing the points $A$ and $B$ respectively in the complex plane.
Let $z \in \C$ be a complex variable representing the point $Z$ in the complex plane.
Let $\lambda \in \R$ be a real constant such that $-\pi < \lambda < \pi$.

Then the equation:

$\arg \dfrac {z - b} {z - a} = \lambda$
represents the arc of a circle with $AB$ as a chord subtending an angle $\lambda$ at $Z$ on the circumference.


Proof


By Geometrical Interpretation of Complex Subtraction:

$z - a$ represents the line from $A$ to $Z$
$z - b$ represents the line from $B$ to $Z$















\(\ds \arg \dfrac {z - b} {z - a}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \lambda\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map \arg {z - b} - \map \arg {z - a}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \lambda\)





Argument of Quotient equals Difference of Arguments




Thus:

$\arg \dfrac {z - b} {z - a} = \lambda$
represents the statement that the angle between $AZ$ and $BZ$ is constant:

$\angle AZB = \lambda$
That is, the angle subtended by $AB$ at $Z$ is $\lambda$.
The result follows from the Inscribed Angle Theorem.

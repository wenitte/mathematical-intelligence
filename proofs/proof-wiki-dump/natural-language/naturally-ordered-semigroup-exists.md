Theorem
Let the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms be accepted as axiomatic.
Then there exists a naturally ordered semigroup.


Proof
We take as axiomatic the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms.
From these, Minimally Inductive Set Exists is demonstrated.
This proves the existence of a minimally inductive set.
Then we have that the Minimally Inductive Set forms Peano Structure.
It follows that the existence of a Peano structure depends upon the existence of such a minimally inductive set.
Then we have that a Naturally Ordered Semigroup forms Peano Structure.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Also defined as
Some sources accept as axiomatic the naturally ordered semigroup itself.

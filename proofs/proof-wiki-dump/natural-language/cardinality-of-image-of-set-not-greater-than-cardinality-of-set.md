Theorem
Let $X, Y$ be sets.
Let $f: X \to Y$ be a mapping.
Let $A$ be a subset of $X$.
Then:

$\card {\map {f^\to} A} \le \card A$
where $\card A$ denotes the cardinality of $A$.


Proof
By definitions of surjection and restriction of mapping:

$F \restriction_A: A \to \map {f^\to} A$ is a surjection
Thus by Surjection iff Cardinal Inequality:

$\card {\map {f^\to} A} \le \card A$
$\blacksquare$

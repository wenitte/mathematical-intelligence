Theorem
Let $\R$ be the set of real numbers.
Let $\size {\, \cdot \,}$ be the absolute value.

Then $\struct {\R, \size {\, \cdot \,}}$ is a normed vector space.


Proof
We have that:

Real Numbers form Vector Space
Absolute Value is Norm
By definition, $\struct {\R, \size {\, \cdot \,}}$ is a normed vector space.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\sequence {a_n}$ be a sequence in $\R$ which does not converge to $0$.

Then $\ds \sum_{i \mathop = 1}^\infty a_n$ diverges.


Proof
We know that Terms in Convergent Series Converge to Zero.
This is the contrapositive statement of this theorem.
Thus, the theorem holds by Rule of Transposition.
$\blacksquare$


Also known as
The Divergence Test is also known as the $n$th term test.
The reason for this is neither apparent nor obvious.

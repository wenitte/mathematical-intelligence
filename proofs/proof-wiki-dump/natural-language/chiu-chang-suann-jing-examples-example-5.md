Example of Problem from Chiu Chang Suann Jing
There are $3$ classes of corn, of which
$3$ bundles of the first class,
$2$ of the second class, and
$1$ of the third class
make $39$ measures.
$2$ of the first,
$3$ of the second, and
$1$ of the third
make $34$ measures.
And:
$1$ of the first,
$2$ of the second, and
$3$ of the third 
make $26$ measures.
How many measures of grain are contained in $1$ bundle of each class?


Solution
The first class bundle contains $9 \frac 1 4$ measures.
The second class bundle contains $4 \frac 1 4$ measures.
The third class bundle contains $2 \frac 3 4$ measures.


Proof
Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ denote the measures of grain contained in one bundle of each of the $1$st, $2$nd and $3$rd class respectively.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 3 x + 2 y + z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 39\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 2 x + 3 y + z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 34\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds x + 2 y + 3 z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 26\)










\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x - y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)





$(1) - (2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 3 x + 2 \paren {x - 5} + z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 39\)





substituting for $y$ in $(1)$




\(\text {(5)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 x + z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 49\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 x - 2 z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13\)





$(1) - (3)$




\(\text {(6)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x - z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \tfrac 1 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 55 \tfrac 1 2\)





$(5) - (6)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 \tfrac 1 4\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \tfrac 1 4\)





substituting for $x$ in $(4)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 \tfrac 1 4 - 6 \tfrac 1 2\)





substituting for $x$ in $(6)$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \tfrac 3 4\)

Examples of Degrees of Vertices
There exists no simple graph whose vertices have degrees $2, 3, 4, 4, 5$.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose there exists a simple graph $G = \struct {V, E}$ with $5$ vertices whose degrees are $2, 3, 4, 4, 5$.
One of the vertices of $G$ has degree $5$.
This contradicts Maximum Degree of Vertex in Simple Graph, which states that no vertex of $G$ can have a degree higher than $4$.
$\blacksquare$

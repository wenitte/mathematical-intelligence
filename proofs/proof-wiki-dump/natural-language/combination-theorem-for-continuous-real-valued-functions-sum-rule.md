Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $f, g :S \to \R$ be contiuous real-valued functions.
Let $f + g : S \to \R$ be the pointwise addition of $f$ and $g$, that is, $f + g$ is the mappping defined by:

$\forall s \in S : \map {\paren{f + g} } s = \map f s + \map g s$

Then:

$f + g$ is a coninuous real-valued function


Proof
Follows from:

Real Numbers form Valued Field
By definition a valued field is a normed division ring
Sum Rule for Continuous Mappings into Normed Division Ring
$\blacksquare$

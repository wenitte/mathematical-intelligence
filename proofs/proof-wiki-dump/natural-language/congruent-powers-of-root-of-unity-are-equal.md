This article is complete as far as it goes, but it could do with expansion.In particular: There is a group-theoretical result which can be applied directly which is worth adding as a second proof. This ties branches together.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by adding this information.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Expand}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Theorem
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$ be a strictly positive integer.
Let $F$ be a field.
Let $\alpha$ be an $n$th root of unity.
Let $k, l \in \Z$ such that $k \equiv l \pmod n$.

Then:

$\alpha^k = \alpha^l$


Proof
By Definition of Congruence Modulo Integer:

$\exists c \in \ZÂ : k = l + c n$
We have:














\(\ds \alpha^k\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \alpha^{\paren {l + c n} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \alpha^l \alpha^{\paren {c n} }\)





Sum of Indices Law for Field














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \alpha^l \cdot 1\)





Integer Power of Root of Unity is Root of Unity














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \alpha^l\)









$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.

Then $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ is first-countable.


Proof
From Real Number Line is Second-Countable we have that $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ is a second-countable space.
The result follows from Second-Countable Space is First-Countable.

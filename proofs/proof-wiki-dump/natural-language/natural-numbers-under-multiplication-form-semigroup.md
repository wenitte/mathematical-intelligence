Theorem
Let $\N$ be the set of natural numbers.
Let $\times$ denote the operation of multiplication on $\N$.

The structure $\struct {\N, \times}$ forms a semigroup.


Proof
Semigroup Axiom $\text S 0$: Closure
We have that Natural Number Multiplication is Closed.
That is, $\struct {\N, \times}$ is closed.
$\Box$


Semigroup Axiom $\text S 1$: Associativity
We have that Natural Number Multiplication is Associative.
$\Box$

Thus the criteria are fulfilled for $\struct {\N, \times}$ to form a semigroup.
$\blacksquare$

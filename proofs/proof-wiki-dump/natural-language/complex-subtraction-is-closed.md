Theorem
The set of complex numbers is closed under subtraction:

$\forall a, b \in \C: a - b \in \C$


Proof
From the definition of complex subtraction:

$a - b := a + \paren {-b}$
where $-b$ is the inverse for complex number addition.
From Complex Numbers under Addition form Group, it follows that:

$\forall a, b \in \C: a + \paren {-b} \in \C$
Therefore complex number subtraction is closed.
$\blacksquare$

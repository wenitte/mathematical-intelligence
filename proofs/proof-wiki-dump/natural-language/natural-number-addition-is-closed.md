Theorem
The operation of addition on the set of natural numbers $\N$ is closed:

$\forall x, y \in \N: x + y \in \N$


Proof
Follows directly from Natural Numbers under Addition form Commutative Monoid.
A monoid by definition is a semigroup.
Again by definition, the operation in a semigroup is closed.
$\blacksquare$

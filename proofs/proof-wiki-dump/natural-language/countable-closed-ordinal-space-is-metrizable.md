Theorem
Let $\Omega$ denote the first uncountable ordinal.
Let $\Gamma$ be a limit ordinal which strictly precedes $\Omega$.
Let $\closedint 0 \Gamma$ denote the closed ordinal space on $\Gamma$.

Then $\closedint 0 \Gamma$ is a metrizable space.


Proof
From Countable Closed Ordinal Space is Second-Countable, $\closedint 0 \Gamma$ has a basis which is $\sigma$-locally finite.
From Ordinal Space is Completely Normal, $\closedint 0 \Gamma$ is a completely normal space.
From Sequence of Implications of Separation Axioms it follows that $\closedint 0 \Gamma$ is a regular space.
The result follows from Metrizable iff Regular and has Sigma-Locally Finite Basis.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a magma.
Let $\struct {\powerset S, \circ_\PP}$ be the power structure of $\struct {S, \circ}$.
Let $S'$ denote the set of singleton elements of $\powerset S$.

Then $\circ_\PP$ is commutative if and only if $\circ$ is commutative.


Proof
From Operation is Isomorphic to Power Structure Operation on Set of Singleton Subsets:

$\struct {S, \circ}$ is isomorphic to $\struct {S', \circ_\PP}$
The result follows from Isomorphism Preserves Commutativity.
$\blacksquare$

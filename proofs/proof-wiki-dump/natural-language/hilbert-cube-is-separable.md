Theorem
Let $M = \struct {I^\omega, d_2}$ be the Hilbert cube.

Then $M$ is a separable space.


Proof
Consider the set $H$ of all points of $M$ which have finitely many rational coordinates and all the rest zero.
Then $H$ forms a countable subset of $A$ which is (everywhere) dense.


This needs considerable tedious hard slog to complete it.In particular: Demonstrate that it is (everywhere) dense.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Finish}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
The result follows by definition of separable space.
$\blacksquare$

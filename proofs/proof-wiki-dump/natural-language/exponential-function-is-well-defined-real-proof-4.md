Theorem
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number.
Let $\exp x$ be the exponential of $x$.

Then $\exp x$ is well-defined.


Proof
This proof assumes the definition of the exponential as the inverse of the logarithm.

From Logarithm is Strictly Increasing, $\ln$ is strictly monotone on $\R_{>0}$.
From Inverse of Strictly Monotone Function, $f$ permits an inverse mapping.

Hence the result, from Inverse Mapping is Unique.

Theorem
Let $n$ be a Kaprekar number of $k$ digits.
Let $m$ be an integer formed from a cyclic permutation of the digits of $n$.
Let $m$ be squared and the result split into $2$ parts, where the $2$nd part is of $k$ digits.
Let these two parts be added, in the way of operating on a Kaprekar number.
If the result is more than $k$ digits long, split that into $2$ parts, where the $2$nd part is of $k$ digits, and add the parts.
The result will be another cyclic permutation of the digits of $n$.

Examples
972
$972$ is a cyclic permutation of the $3$-digit Kaprekar number $297$.
Thus we have:














\(\ds 972^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 944 \, 784\)




















\(\ds 944 + 784\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1728\)




















\(\ds 1 + 728\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 729\)









and it is seen that $729$ is another cyclic permutation of $297$.
$\blacksquare$


2727
$2727$ is a cyclic permutation of the $4$-digit Kaprekar number $7272$.
Thus we have:














\(\ds 2727^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \, 436 \, 529\)




















\(\ds 743 + 6529\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7272\)









and it is seen that $7272$ is a (trivial) cyclic permutation of $7272$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$ be straight lines which intersect at $O$.
Let $\LL_3$ and $\LL_4$ be the angle bisectors of the angles formed at the point of intersection of $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$.

Then $\LL_3$ and $\LL_4$ are harmonic conjugates with respect to $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$.


Proof
Consider a straight line parallel to $\LL_4$ which intersects $\LL_1$, $\LL_2$ and $\LL_3$ at $L$, $M$ and $N$ respectively.
From Bisectors of Adjacent Angles between Straight Lines Meeting at Point are Perpendicular, $\LL_3$ is perpendicular to $\LL_4$.
Hence as $LM$ is parallel to $\LL_4$, $LM$ is perpendicular to $ON$, which is $\LL3$.




The triangle $\triangle OLM$ has:

$\angle NOL = \angle NOM$
$\angle ONL = \angle ONM$ as both are right angles
$ON$ common
So $\triangle ONL$ and $\triangle ONM$ are congruent.
So $N$ is the midpoint of $LM$.

From Harmonic Range with Unity Ratio, the points $L$, $N$, $M$ and the point at infinity form a harmonic range.
Hence from Straight Line which cuts Harmonic Pencil forms Harmonic Range, the straight lines $\LL_1$, $\LL_2$, $\LL_3$ and $\LL_4$ form a harmonic pencil.
That is: $\LL_3$ and $\LL_4$ are harmonic conjugates with respect to $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$.

Theorem
Every ordinal is a transitive set.


Proof
Let $\alpha$ be an ordinal by Definition 3.
An ordinal is a strictly well-ordered set $\struct {\alpha, \prec}$ such that:

$\forall \beta \in \alpha: \alpha_\beta = \beta$
where $\alpha_\beta$ is the initial segment of $\alpha$ determined by $\beta$:

$\alpha_\beta = \set {x \in \alpha: x \prec \beta}$

That is, $\alpha$ is a transitive set.

Theorem
The set of real numbers under addition $\struct {\R, +}$ forms a monoid.


Proof
Taking the monoid axioms in turn:


Monoid Axiom $\text S 0$: Closure
Real Addition is Closed.
$\Box$


Monoid Axiom $\text S 1$: Associativity
Real Addition is Associative.
$\Box$


Monoid Axiom $\text S 2$: Identity
From Real Addition Identity is Zero, we have that the identity element of $\struct {\R, +}$ is the real number $0$.
$\Box$

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

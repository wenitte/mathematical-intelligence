Theorem
Let $\struct {\N, \times}$ denote the set of natural numbers under multiplication.
Let $\struct {\Z, \times}$ denote the set of integers under multiplication.

Then $\struct {\N, \times}$ is a subsemigroup of $\struct {\Z, \times}$.


Proof
We have from Natural Numbers under Multiplication form Semigroup that $\struct {\N, \times}$ forms a semigroup.
We have from Integers under Multiplication form Semigroup that $\struct {\Z, \times}$ forms a semigroup.
From Natural Numbers are Non-Negative Integers, we have that $\N \subseteq \Z$.
From the definition of integer multiplication it follows that $\times: \Z \to \Z$ is an extension of $\times: \N \to \N$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

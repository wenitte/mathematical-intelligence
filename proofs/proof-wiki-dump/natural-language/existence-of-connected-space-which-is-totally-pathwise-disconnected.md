Theorem
There exists at least one example of a topological space which is both connected and totally pathwise disconnected.


Proof
Let $T$ be Gustin's sequence space.

From Gustin's Sequence Space is Connected, $T$ is a connected space.
From Gustin's Sequence Space is Totally Pathwise Disconnected, $T$ is a totally pathwise disconnected space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Pi ($\pi$) is irrational.


Proof
From Rational Points on Graph of Sine Function, the only rational point on the graph of the sine function in the real Cartesian plane $\R^2$:

$f := \left\{ {\left({x, y}\right) \in \R^2: y = \sin x}\right\}$
is the point $\left({0, 0}\right)$.
But $\left({\pi, 0}\right)$ is also on $f$.
Hence $\pi$ cannot be rational.

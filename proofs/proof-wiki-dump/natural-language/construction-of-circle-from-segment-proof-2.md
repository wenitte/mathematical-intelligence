Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

Given a segment of a circle, to describe the complete circle of which it is a segment.
(The Elements: Book $\text{III}$: Proposition $25$)


Proof

Choose any point $C$ on the circumference.
Bisect $AC$ at $D$ and $BC$ at $E$ and construct a perpendicular $DF$ and $EF$ from each through the point of bisection.
The point of intersection $F$ is the center of the required circle.

$AFC$ and $CFB$ are isosceles triangles and so $AF, CF$ and $BF$ are all equal.
The result follows from Condition for Point to be Center of Circle.
$\blacksquare$

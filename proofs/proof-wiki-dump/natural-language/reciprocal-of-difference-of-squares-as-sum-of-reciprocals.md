Theorem
$\dfrac 1 {x^2 - y^2} = \dfrac 1 {2 x \paren {x + y} } + \dfrac 1 {2 x \paren {x - y} }$


Proof













\(\ds \dfrac 1 {x + y} + \dfrac 1 {x - y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\paren {x - y} + \paren {x + y} } {\paren {x - y} \paren {x + y} }\)





putting everything over a common denominator














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 x} {x^2 - y^2}\)





simplifying, and Difference of Two Squares








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac 1 {2 x \paren {x + y} } + \dfrac 1 {2 x \paren {x - y} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {x^2 - y^2}\)





dividing both sides by $2 x$



$\blacksquare$

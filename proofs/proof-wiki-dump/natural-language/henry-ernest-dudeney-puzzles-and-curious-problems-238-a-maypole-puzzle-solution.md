A Maypole Puzzle
During a gale a maypole was broken in such a manner that it struck the level ground at a distance of $20$ feet from the base of the pole,
where it entered the earth.
It was repaired, and broken by the wind a second time at a point $5$ feet lower down,
and struck the ground at a distance of $30$ feet from the base.
What was the original height of the pole?


Solution
$50$ feet.


Proof
Let $L$ feet be the length of the maypole.
Let $d$ feet be the distance above the ground of the point where first it snapped.
The maypole, the snapped-off part, and the ground form a right triangle.
Hence we can use Pythagoras's Theorem to obtain:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \paren {L - d}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds d^2 + 20^2\)





... it struck the level ground at a distance of $20$ feet from the base of the pole,




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \paren {L - \paren {d - 5} }^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {d - 5}^2 + 30^2\)





... second time at a point $5$ feet lower down, and struck the ground at a distance of $30$ feet from the base.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds L^2 - 2 L d + d^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds d^2 + 400\)





expanding














\(\ds L^2 - 2 L \paren {d - 5} + \paren {d - 5}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {d - 5}^2 + 900\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds L^2 - 2 L d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 400\)





simplifying




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)









\(\ds L^2 - 2 L d + 10 L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 900\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 10 L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 500\)





$(4) - (3)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 50\)

Theorem
Let $a$ and $b$ be the legs of a Pythagorean triangle $P_1$.
Let $\tuple {a, b}$ be used as the generator for a new Pythagorean triangle $P_2$.
Then the hypotenuse of $P_2$ is the square of the hypotenuse of $P_1$.


Proof
By Pythagoras's Theorem, the square of the hypotenuse of $P_1$ is $a^2 + b^2$.
By Solutions of Pythagorean Equation, the sides of $P_2$ can be expressed as $\tuple {2 a b, a^2 - b^2, a^2 + b^2}$, where the hypotenuse is $a^2 + b^2$.
$\blacksquare$


Examples
$3-4-5$ Triangle
The $3-4-5$ triangle has hypotenuse $5$.



By Solutions of Pythagorean Equation, the Pythagorean triangle $P_2$ formed by the generator $\tuple {4, 3}$ is:














\(\ds P_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {2 \times 4 \times 3, 4^2 - 3^2, 4^2 + 3^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {24, 7, 25}\)









It is observed that $25 = 5^2$.




Historical Note
According to David Wells in Curious and Interesting Numbers, 2nd ed. of $1997$, this observation was made by W.P. Whitlock, Jr., although no details are given of where or when.

Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $130$
Mr. Grindle's Garden
"My neighbour," said Mr. Grindle, "generously offered me, for a garden,
as much land as I could enclose with four straight walls measuring $7$, $8$, $9$ and $10$ rods in length respectively."
"And what was the largest area you were able to enclose?" asked his friend.
Perhaps the reader can discover Mr. Grindle's correct answer.


Solution
Just under $71$ square rods.


Proof
Let $\AA$ square rods be the area of the garden.
We are given that $\AA$ is the greatest possible for the given sides.
We also have that the sides of the garden are in arithmetic sequence.

Thus:














\(\ds \AA\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {7 \times 8 \times 9 \times 10}\)





Greatest Area of Quadrilateral with Sides in Arithmetic Sequence














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {5040}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\approx\)







\(\ds 70.99\)

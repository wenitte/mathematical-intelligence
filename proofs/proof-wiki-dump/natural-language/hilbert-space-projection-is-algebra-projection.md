Theorem
Let $\struct {\HH, \innerprod \cdot \cdot}$ be a Hilbert space over $\C$.
Let $\map B \HH$ be the space of bounded linear operators on $\HH$ understood as a $\text C^\ast$-algebra.
Let $PÂ : \HH \to \HH$ be a Hilbert space projection.

Then $P$ is a $\ast$-algebra projection.


Proof
From Characterization of Projections, $P$ is Hermitian.
By definition, $P$ is an idempotent operator so that $P^2 = P$.
So $P$ is a $\ast$-algebra projection.

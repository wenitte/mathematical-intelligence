Theorem
The smallest positive integer which can be expressed as the sum of $3$ fourth powers in $2$ different ways is $6578$:














\(\ds 1^4 + 2^4 + 9^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 + 16 + 6561\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6578\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 81 + 2401 + 4096\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3^4 + 7^4 + 8^4\)











Proof
The fact that this is the smallest can be demonstrated by calculation.
$\blacksquare$

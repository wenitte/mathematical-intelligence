Theorem
There exists at least one example of a topological space for which none of the Tychonoff separation axioms are satisfied except for the $T_3$ axiom.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample:
Let $T$ be the topological space consisting of the double pointed topology on the Tychonoff corkscrew topology.
From Double Pointed Tychonoff Corkscrew fulfils no Separation Axioms but $T_3$, we have that $T$ satisfies none of the Tychonoff separation axioms except for the $T_3$ axiom.
$\blacksquare$

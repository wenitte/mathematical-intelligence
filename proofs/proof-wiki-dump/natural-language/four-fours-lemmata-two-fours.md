Puzzle
Two instances of $4$ can be used to make the following:

Two Fours: $0$
$0 = 4 - 4$
Two Fours: $1$
$1 = \dfrac 4 4$
Two Fours: $2$
$2 = 4 - \sqrt 4$
Two Fours: $3$
$3 = \sqrt {\dfrac 4 {. \dot 4} }$
Two Fours: $4$
$4 = \sqrt 4 + \sqrt 4$
Two Fours: $5$
$5 = \dfrac {\sqrt 4} {.4}$
Two Fours: $6$
$6 = 4 + \sqrt 4$
Two Fours: $7$
$7 = \map \Gamma 4 + \map \Gamma {\sqrt 4}$
Two Fours: $8$
$8 = 4 \times \sqrt 4$
Two Fours: $9$
$9 = \dfrac 4 {. \dot 4}$
Two Fours: $10$
$10 = \dfrac 4 {.4}$
Two Fours: $12$
$12 = \dfrac {4!} {\sqrt 4}$
Two Fours: $15$
$15 = \dfrac {\map \Gamma 4} {.4}$
Two Fours: $16$
$16 = 4 \times 4$
Two Fours: $18$
$18 = 4! - \map \Gamma 4$
Two Fours: $20$
$20 = 4! - 4$
Two Fours: $22$
$22 = 4! - \sqrt 4$
Two Fours: $23$
$23 = 4! - \map \Gamma {\sqrt 4}$
Two Fours: $24$
$24 = \paren {\sqrt 4 + \sqrt 4}!$
Two Fours: $25$
$25 = 4! + \map \Gamma {\sqrt 4}$
Two Fours: $26$
$26 = 4! + \sqrt 4$
Two Fours: $28$
$28 = 4! + 4$
Two Fours: $30$
$30 = 4! + \map \Gamma 4$
Two Fours: $36$
$36 = \dfrac {4!} {\sqrt{. \dot 4} }$
Two Fours: $44$
$44 = 44$
Two Fours: $48$
$48 = 4! + 4!$
Two Fours: $54$
$54 = \dfrac {4!} {. \dot 4}$
Two Fours: $60$
$60 = \dfrac {4!} {.4}$
Two Fours: $64$
$64 = \paren {\sqrt 4}^{\map \Gamma 4}$
Two Fours: $96$
$96 = 4 \times 4!$
Two Fours: $120$
$120 = \paren {\dfrac {\sqrt 4} {.4} }!$

$\blacksquare$

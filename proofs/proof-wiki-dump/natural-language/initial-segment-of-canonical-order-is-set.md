Theorem
Let $R_0$ denote the canonical ordering of $\paren {\On \times \On}$.
Then, for all $\tuple {x, y} \in \paren {\On \times \On}$, the $R_0$-initial segment is a set.

Proof
Let $z = \map \max {x, y}^+$.
Let $\tuple {v, w} \mathrel R_0 \tuple {x, y}$.

Then:














\(\ds \map \max {v, w}\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds \map \max {x, y}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\lt\)







\(\ds z\)









Thus, the initial segment:

$\paren {\On \times \On}_{\tuple {x, y} } \subseteq \paren {z \times z}$

By Axiom of Subsets Equivalents, the initial segment of $\tuple {x, y}$ is a set.

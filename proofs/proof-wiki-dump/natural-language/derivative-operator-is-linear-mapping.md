Theorem
Let $I := \closedint a b$ be a closed real interval.
Let $C \closedint a b$ be the space of real-valued functions continuous on $I$.
Let $C^1 \closedint a b$ be the space of real-valued functions continuously differentiable on $I$.
Let $D$ be the derivative operator such that:

$D : \map {C^1} I \to \map C I$
and $Dx := x'$.

Then $D$ is a linear mapping.


Proof
Distributivity













\(\ds \map D {x + y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {x + y}'\)





Definition














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds x' + y'\)





Sum Rule for Derivatives














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds Dx + Dy\)





Definition



$\Box$


Positive homogenity













\(\ds \map D {\alpha x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\alpha x}'\)

By definition, $D$ is a linear mapping

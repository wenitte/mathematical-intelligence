Theorem
Let $V$ be a vector space over a real subfield $\GF$.
Let $\innerprod \cdot \cdot: V \times V \to \GF$ be a real semi-inner product.

Then $\innerprod \cdot \cdot$ is a complex semi-inner product

Proof
This follows immediately from:

Definition of Real Semi-Inner Product
Definition of Complex Semi-Inner Product
Complex Number equals Conjugate iff Wholly Real
$\blacksquare$

Problem
Find two rectangles with integral sides, such that:
the area of the first is $3$ times the area of the second
the perimeter of the second is $3$ times the perimeter of the first.


Solution
The rectangles are:

$53 \times 54$
and:

$318 \times 3$


Proof
As can be seen:














\(\ds 53 \times 54\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2862\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times \paren {318 \times 3}\)









and:














\(\ds 3 \times \paren {2 \times \paren {53 + 54} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 642\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times \paren {318 + 3}\)









and it is seen that the two rectangles fulfil the given conditions.

Let the given ratio be made general, that is, $n$ rather than $3$.
Let $u, v$ and $x, y$ be the sides of the rectangles.
Then we can write:














\(\ds u + v\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n \paren {x + y}\)




















\(\ds x y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n u v\)









Thus the general solution is:














\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 n^3 - 1\)




















\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 n^3\)




















\(\ds u\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n \paren {4 n^3 - 2}\)




















\(\ds v\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n\)









Setting $n = 3$ gives the solution.

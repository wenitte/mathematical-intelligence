Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a countable complement topology on an uncountable set $S$.

Then $T$ satisfies the countable chain condition.


Proof
We have that a Countable Complement Space is Irreducible.
Therefore there is no disjoint set of open sets of $T$.
So the result holds vacuously.

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $130$
Milk and Cream
A dairyman found that the milk supplied by his cows was $5$ per cent cream and $95$ per cent skimmed milk.
He wanted to know how much skimmed milk he must add to a quart of whole milk to reduce the percentage of cream to $4$ per cent.


Solution
Half a pint.


Proof
Let $v_c$ be the volume of cream in a volume $v$ of whole milk.
Let $w$ be the quantity of skimmed milk needed to reduce the volume of cream to $4 \%$.
We have:














\(\ds v_c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac v {20}\)





... $5$ per cent cream and $95$ per cent skimmed milk.














\(\ds v_c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {v + w} {25}\)





... reduce the percentage of cream to $4$ per cent.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac v {20}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {v + w} {25}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 v\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \paren {v + w}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac v 4\)









As we are told that $v$ is $1$ quart, it follows that the amount of skimmed milk to be added is half a pint.
$\blacksquare$

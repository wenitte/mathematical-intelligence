Problem
There is a certain island, situated between England and France,
and yet, that island is farther from France than England is.


Solution
At their closest point, England and France are $34$ kilometres apart.
The English Channel, the body of water which lies between England and France is considerably wider than that through most of its length.
Guernsey, for example, one of the Channel Islands, is about $42$ kilometres from France, but well and truly in the English Channel between England and France.
The Isle of Wight is also between England and France, and considerably further away from France than Guernsey is.
$\blacksquare$

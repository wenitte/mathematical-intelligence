Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, +}$ denote the additive group of real numbers.
Let $\struct {\R_{\ne 0}, \times}$ denote the multiplicative group of real numbers.

Then $\struct {\R, +}$ is not isomorphic to $\struct {\R_{\ne 0}, \times}$.


Proof
From Real Numbers form Field, $\struct {\R, +, \times}$ forms a field.
The result then follows as an example of Additive Group and Multiplicative Group of Field are not Isomorphic.
$\blacksquare$

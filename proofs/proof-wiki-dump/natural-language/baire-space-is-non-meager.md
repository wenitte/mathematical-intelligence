Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a Baire space (in the context of topology).

Then $T$ is non-meager in $T$.


Proof
From Baire Space iff Open Sets are Non-Meager, all open sets of $T$ are non-meager in $T$.
But $T$ itself is an open set of $T$ by definition of topological space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

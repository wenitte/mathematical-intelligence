Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a discrete topological space.
Let $A \subseteq S$.

Then:

$A = A^\circ = A^-$
where:

$A^\circ$ is the interior of $A$
$A^-$ is the closure of $A$.


Proof
Let $A \subseteq S$.
Then from Set in Discrete Topology is Clopen it follows that $A$ is both open and closed in $T$.
From Closed Set Equals its Closure we have that $A = A^-$.
From Set Interior is Largest Open Set, we have that $A^\circ = A$.
$\blacksquare$

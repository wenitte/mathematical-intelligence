Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space where $S$ is a finite set.
Then $T$ satisfies the following compactness properties:

$T$ is compact.
$T$ is sequentially compact.
$T$ is countably compact.
$T$ is weakly countably compact.
$T$ is a Lindel√∂f space.
$T$ is pseudocompact.
$T$ is $\sigma$-compact.
$T$ is strongly locally compact.
$T$ is $\sigma$-locally compact.
$T$ is weakly $\sigma$-locally compact.
$T$ is locally compact.
$T$ is weakly locally compact.
$T$ is paracompact.
$T$ is countably paracompact.
$T$ is metacompact.
$T$ is countably metacompact.


Proof
We have that:

A Finite Topological Space is Compact.
A Finite Space is Sequentially Compact.

The remaining properties are demonstrated in:

Sequence of Implications of Local Compactness Properties
Sequence of Implications of Paracompactness Properties

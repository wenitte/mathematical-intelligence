Theorem
Let $\left({S, \preceq, \tau}\right)$ be a generalized ordered space.
Let $p \in S$.

Then:

$p^\prec$ and $p^\succ$ are $\tau$-open
where:

$p^\prec$ is the strict lower closure of $p$
$p^\succ$ is the strict upper closure of $p$.


Proof for Definition 1 of GO-Space
We will prove that $U = p^\succ$ is $\tau$-open.
That $p^\prec$ is $\tau$-open will follow by duality.
Let $u \in U$.
Since $p \notin U$, $p \ne u$.
By definition of GO-space, $\tau$ is Hausdorff.
From $T_2$ Space is $T_1$ Space, $\tau$ is $T_1$.
Thus by definition of GO-space, there is an open, convex set $M$ such that $u \in M$ and $p \notin M$.
Next we will show that $M \subseteq U$:
Let $x \in S \setminus U$.
Then $x \preceq p \preceq u$.
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $x \in M$.
Since $x, u \in M$, $p \in M$ because $M$ is convex, contradicting the choice of $M$.
Thus $x \notin M$.
Since this hold for all $x \in S \setminus U$, $M \subseteq U$.
Thus $U$ contains a neighborhood of each of its points.
From Set is Open iff Neighborhood of all its Points, $U$ is open.
$\blacksquare$


Proof for Definition 2 of GO-Space
We will prove that $p^\succ$ is open.

That $p^\prec$ is open will follow by duality.
By Inverse Image under Order Embedding of Strict Upper Closure of Image of Point:

$\map {\phi^{-1} } {\map \phi p^\succ} = p^\succ$
$\map \phi p^\succ$ is an open ray in $S'$
Therefore $\tau'$-open by the definition of the order topology.

Since $\phi$ is a topological embedding, it is continuous.
Thus $p^\succ$ is $\tau$-open.

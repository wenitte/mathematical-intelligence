This page has been identified as a candidate for refactoring.In particular: This proof is valid only in the Real Euclidean Space that the definition is defined for. Need a version from the general Vector Space.Until this has been finished, please leave {{Refactor}} in the code.
New contributors: Refactoring is a task which is expected to be undertaken by experienced editors only.

Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.
Theorem
Let $\mathbf u$ be a vector quantity.
Let $\cdot$ denote the dot product operator.
Then:

$\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf 0 = 0$
where $\mathbf 0$ denotes the zero vector.


Proof
By definition of dot product:














\(\ds \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \norm {\mathbf u} \norm {\mathbf 0} \cos \theta\)





Definition of Dot Product














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \norm {\mathbf u} \times 0 \times \cos \theta\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)

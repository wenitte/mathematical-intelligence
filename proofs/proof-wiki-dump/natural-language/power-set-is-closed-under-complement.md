Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.

Then:

$\forall A \in \powerset S: \relcomp S A \in \powerset S$
where $\relcomp S A$ denotes the complement of $A$ relative to $S$.


Proof













\(\ds A\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \powerset S\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds A\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds S\)

Theorem
Let $X, Y$ be random variables.
Let $a, b$ be real numbers.

Then: 

$\cov {a X, b Y} = a b \cov {X, Y}$


Proof













\(\ds \cov {a X, b Y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \expect {a X b Y} - \expect {a X} \expect {b Y}\)





Covariance as Expectation of Product minus Product of Expectations














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a b \expect {X Y} - a b \expect X \expect Y\)





Expectation of Linear Transformation of Random Variable














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a b \paren {\expect {X Y} - \expect X \expect Y}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a b \cov {X, Y}\)





Covariance as Expectation of Product minus Product of Expectations



$\blacksquare$

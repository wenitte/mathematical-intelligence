Theorem
Consider the electric circuit $K$ consisting of:

a resistance $R$
an inductance $L$
in series with a source of electromotive force $E$ which is a function of time $t$.



Let the electric current flowing in $K$ at time $t = 0$ be $I_0$.
Let  EMF imposed upon $K$ be zero.
The electric current $I$ in $K$ is given by the equation:

$I = I_0 e^{-R t / L}$


Proof
From Electric Current in Electric Circuit: L, R in Series: Constant EMF at $t = 0$:

$I = \dfrac {E_0} R + \paren {I_0 - \dfrac {E_0} R} e^{-R t / L}$
Setting $E_0 = 0$:














\(\ds I\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 0 R + \paren {I_0 - \dfrac 0 R} e^{-R t / L}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds I_0 e^{-R t / L}\)









Hence the result.

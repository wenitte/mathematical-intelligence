Theorem
Let $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ be cuts.
Let the operation of $\alpha + \beta$ be the sum of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
Let $\beta < \gamma$ denotes the strict ordering on cuts defined as:

$\beta < \gamma \iff \exists p \in \Q: p \in \beta, p \notin \gamma$

Then:

$\beta < \gamma \implies \alpha + \beta < \alpha + \gamma$


Corollary
Let $0^*$ denote the rational cut associated with the (rational) number $0$.

If:

$\alpha > 0^*$ and $\gamma > 0^*$
then:

$\alpha + \gamma > 0^*$


Proof
By definition of the strict ordering on cuts and addition of cuts:

$\alpha + \beta \le \alpha + \gamma$

Suppose $\alpha + \beta = \alpha + \gamma$.
Then:














\(\ds \beta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0^* + \beta\)





Identity Element for Addition of Cuts














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {-\alpha} + \paren {\alpha + \beta}\)





Definition of Negative of Cut














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {-\alpha} + \paren {\alpha + \gamma}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0^* + \gamma\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \gamma\)










Thus:

$\beta = \gamma$
and the result follows.

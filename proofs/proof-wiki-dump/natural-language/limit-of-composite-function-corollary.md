Corollary to Limit of Composite Function
Let $I$ and $J$ be real intervals.
Let:

$(1): \quad g: I \to J$ be a real function which is continuous on $I$
$(2): \quad f: J \to \R$ be a real function which is continuous on $J$.
Then the composite function $f \circ g$ is continuous on $I$.


Proof
This follows directly and trivially from:

the definition of continuity at a point
the definition of continuity on an interval
Limit of Composite Function.

Theorem
Let $A$, $B$, and $S$ be sets.
Let $A \subseteq B$.

Then:

$A \setminus S \subseteq B \setminus S$


Proof













\(\ds A \setminus S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds A \cap \map \complement S\)





Set Difference as Intersection with Complement














\(\ds \)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds B \cap \map \complement S\)





Corollary to Set Intersection Preserves Subsets














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds B \setminus S\)





Set Difference as Intersection with Complement



$\blacksquare$

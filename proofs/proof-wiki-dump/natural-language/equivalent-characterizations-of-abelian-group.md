Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.

The following statements are equivalent:




\((1)\)  

$:$  













$G$ is abelian   

  


\((2)\)  

$:$  













$\forall a, b \in G: \paren {a b}^{-1} = a^{-1} b^{-1}$   

  


\((3)\)  

$:$  













Definition of Cross Cancellation Property: $\forall a, b, c \in G: a b = c a \implies b = c$   

  


\((4)\)  

$:$  













Definition of Middle Cancellation Property: $\forall a, b, c, d, x \in G: a x b = c x d \implies a b = c d$   

  


\((5)\)  

$:$  













the opposite group to $G$ is $G$ itself.   

  



Proof
$(1)$ iff $(2)$
See Inversion Mapping is Automorphism iff Group is Abelian.
$\Box$


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: There's a better link that proves this one, but IIRC it's difficult to find. I've been tidying up this recently, I'll see if I can find it in a bit.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.


$(1)$ iff $(3)$
See Group is Abelian iff it has Cross Cancellation Property.
$\Box$


$(1)$ iff $(4)$
See Group is Abelian iff it has Middle Cancellation Property.
$\Box$


$(1)$ iff $(5)$
See Group is Abelian iff Opposite Group is Itself.
$\Box$

Hence all $5$ statements are logically equivalent.
$\blacksquare$

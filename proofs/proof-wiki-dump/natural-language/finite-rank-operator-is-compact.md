Theorem
Let $H, K$ be Hilbert spaces.
Let $T \in \map {B_{00} } {H, K}$ be a bounded finite rank operator.

Then $T \in \map {B_0} {H, K}$, that is, $T$ is compact.

Let $A$ be a bounded set in $H$.
Since $T$ is bounded, the image $T \sqbrk A$ is a bounded set by definition.
Since $T$ is finite rank operator, its range $\Rng T$ is finite dimensional.
The closure of a bounded set in $\Rng T$ is compact, by Heine-Borel Theorem.
So the closure of $T \sqbrk A$ in $\Rng T$ is compact.
Therefore, $T$ is a compact linear operator.
$\blacksquare$

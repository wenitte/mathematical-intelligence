Theorem
Let $\sequence {a_k}$ be a geometric sequence whose terms are rational.

Then the common ratio of $\sequence {a_k}$ is rational.


Proof
Let $r$ be the common ratio of $\sequence {a_k}$.
Let $p, q$ be consecutive terms of $r$.
We have by hypothesis that:

$p, q \in \Q$
Then, by definition of geometric sequence:

$q = r p$
It follows that:

$r = \dfrac q p$
From Rational Numbers form Field, $\Q$ is closed under division.
Thus $r \in \Q$ and hence the result.

Theorem
The following definitions of the upper Wythoff sequence are equivalent:

Definition 1
The upper Wythoff sequence is the complementary Beatty sequence on the golden section $\phi$.

Definition 2
The upper Wythoff sequence is the Beatty sequence on the square $\phi^2$ of the golden section $\phi$.


Proof
From Beatty's Theorem, the Beatty sequences $\BB_r$ and $\BB_s$ are complementary if and only if:

$\dfrac 1 r + \dfrac 1 s = 1$
It remains to be demonstrated that this holds for $r = \phi$ and $s = \phi^2$.

Thus:














\(\ds \dfrac 1 \phi + \dfrac 1 {\phi^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\phi + 1} {\phi^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\phi^2} {\phi^2}\)





Square of Golden Mean equals One plus Golden Mean














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)









Hence the result.

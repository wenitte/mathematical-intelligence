Theorem
Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be straight lines in the Cartesian plane.
Let the slope of $L_1$ and $L_2$ be $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ respectively.

Then $L_1$ is parallel to $L_2$ if and only if:

$\mu_1 = \mu_2$


Proof
Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be embedded in a cartesian plane, given by the equations:








\(\ds L_1: \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m_1 x + c_1\)














\(\ds L_2: \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m_2 x + c_2\)










Let $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ be the angles that $L_1$ and $L_2$ make with the $x$-axis respectively.
Then by definition of slope of a straight line:














\(\ds \tan \psi_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m_1\)




















\(\ds \tan \psi_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m_2\)











Necessary Condition
Let $m_1 = m_2$.
Then:

$\tan \psi_1 = \tan \psi_2$
and so:

$\psi_1 = \psi_2 + n \pi$
The multiple of $\pi$ makes no difference.
Thus from Equal Corresponding Angles implies Parallel Lines, $L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel.
$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Suppose $L_1 \parallel L_2$.
Then:














\(\ds \phi_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \phi_2\)





Parallelism implies Equal Corresponding Angles








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \tan \phi_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tan \phi_2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m_2\)

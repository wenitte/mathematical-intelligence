Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $62$
At Right Angles
How soon between the hours of five and six will the hour and minute hands of a clock be exactly at right angles?


Solution
$10 \tfrac {10} {11}$ past $5$.



Proof $1$
Let $T$ be the time in question.
Let $m$ be the number of minutes past $5:00$ that $T$ is.
Let $\theta \degrees$ be the angle made by the minute hand with respect to twelve o'clock at time $T$.
Let $\phi \degrees$ be the angle made by the hour hand with respect to twelve o'clock at time $T$.
Between $5:00$ and $6:00$ we have that $150 < \phi < 180$.
Hence from Condition for Valid Time Indication, we have that:

$12 \paren {\phi - 150} = \theta$
Then we are told that:

$\theta = \phi - 90$
as (from how soon) we are interested in the earliest instance of the hands being at right angles.
Hence:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \theta + 90\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \phi\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 12 \paren {\phi - 150}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \theta\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 12 \paren {\theta + 90 - 150}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \theta\)





substituting for $\phi$ in $(2)$ from $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 11 \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12 \times 60\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12 \times 60} {11}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12 \times 60} {11} \times \dfrac 1 6\)





Speed of Minute Hand














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10 \tfrac {10} {11}\)





calculating



Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Proof $2$
From Time when Hour Hand and Minute Hand at Right Angle, the times when this is between $5$ and $6$ are:

$05:10:55$
and:

$05:43:38$
The first of these is the earlier of those two times.
$\blacksquare$

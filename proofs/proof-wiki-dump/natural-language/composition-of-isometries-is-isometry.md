Theorem
Let:

$\struct {X_1, d_1}$
$\struct {X_2, d_2}$
$\struct {X_3, d_3}$
be metric spaces.
Let:

$\phi: \struct {X_1, d_1} \to \struct {X_2, d_2}$
$\psi: \struct {X_2, d_2} \to \struct {X_3, d_3}$
be isometries.
Then the composite of $\phi$ and $\psi$ is also an isometry.


Proof
An isometry is a distance-preserving mapping which is also a bijection.

From Composition of Distance-Preserving Mappings is Distance-Preserving, $\psi \circ \phi$ is a distance-preserving mapping.
From Composite of Bijections is Bijection, $\psi \circ \phi$ is a bijection.

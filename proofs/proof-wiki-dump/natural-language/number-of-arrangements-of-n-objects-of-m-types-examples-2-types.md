Example of Use of Number of Arrangements of $n$ Objects of $m$ Types
Let $S$ be a collection of $n$ objects, consisting of:

$p$ objects of one type
$q$ objects of another type.
The total number $N$ of different arrangements of $S$ is given by:

$N = \dfrac {n!}  {p! \, q!}$


Proof
An arbitrary arrangement can be made into $p!$ arrangements if the $p$ objects of type $1$ are replaced by $p$ objects that are all different.
Similarly, an arbitrary arrangement can be made into $q!$ arrangements if the $q$ objects of type $2$ are replaced by $q$ objects that are all different.
The total number of arrangements, if all objects are different, would be $n!$
Hence:

$n! = N \times p! \times q!$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

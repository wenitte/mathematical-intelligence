Theorem
Let $D$ be a principal ideal domain whose zero is $0_D$.
Let $J \subseteq D$ be a nonzero prime ideal.

Then $J$ is maximal.


Proof
As $D$ is a principal ideal domain, every ideal of $D$ is a principal ideal $\ideal r$ generated by some $r \in D$.
So, let $\ideal p$ be an arbitrary prime ideal of $D$ generated by $p$, where $p \ne 0_R$.
As $\ideal p$ is prime, $p$ is irreducible.

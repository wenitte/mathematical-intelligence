Theorem
$\ds \int e^x \rd x = e^x + C$
where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.


Proof for Complex Numbers
Let $z \in \C$ be a complex variable.














\(\ds \map {D_z} {e^z}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^z\)





Definition of Complex Exponential Function



The result follows by the definition of the primitive.

Theorem
Let $\mathbf C$ and $\mathbf D$ be metacategories.
Let $F: \mathbf C \to \mathbf D$ be a fully faithful functor.

Let $\mathbf B$ be the full subcategory of $\mathbf D$ consisting of:

the collection of objects $\map F X$ for each object $X$ of $\mathbf C$
the collection of morphisms $\map F f$ for each morphism $f$ of $\mathbf C$
with composition and identity morphisms inherited from $\mathbf D$.

Then:

$\mathbf C$ is equivalent to $\mathbf B$ with isomorphism $G: \mathbf C \to \mathbf B$ defined by:









Object Functor:   



\(\ds \map G c = \map F c \)   







  for each object $c$ of $\mathbf C$








Morphism Functor:   



\(\ds \map G f = \map F f \)   







  for each morphism $f$ of $\mathbf C$

Proof
$\blacksquare$

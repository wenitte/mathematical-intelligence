Theorem
Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral.
Then:

$ABCD$ is a parallelogram
if and only if:

both:
$AD$ is a bisector of $BC$
and:
$BC$ is a bisector of $AD$.


Proof
Sufficient Condition
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram.

Then by Diameters of Parallelogram Bisect each other:

$AD$ is a bisector of $BC$
and

$BC$ is a bisector of $AD$.
$\Box$


Necessary Condition
Let $ABCD$ be such that:

$AD$ is a bisector of $BC$
and

$BC$ is a bisector of $AD$.
Then from Quadrilateral with Bisecting Diagonals is Parallelogram, $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.
$\blacksquare$

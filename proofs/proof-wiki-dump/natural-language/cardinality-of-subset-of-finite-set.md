Theorem
Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets such that $A \subseteq B$.
Let

$\card B = n$
where $\card {\, \cdot \,}$ denotes cardinality.

Then $\card A \le n$.


Proof
Let $A \subseteq B$.

There are two cases:

$(1): \quad A \ne B$
In this case:

$A \subsetneqq B$
and from Cardinality of Proper Subset of Finite Set:

$\card A < n$

$(2): \quad A = B$
In this case:

$\card A = \card B$
and so:

$\card A = n$

In both cases:

$\card A \le n$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

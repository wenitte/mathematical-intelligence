Theorem
Let $B$ be a class.
Suppose $B$ is non-empty.

Then $B$ has a strictly minimal element under $\in$.

 This page is beyond the scope of ZFC, and should not be used in anything other than the theory in which it resides.

If you believe that the contents of this page can be reworked to allow ZFC, then you can discuss it at the talk page.

By Epsilon Relation is Strictly Well-Founded, $\Epsilon$, the epsilon relation, is a strictly well-founded relation on $B$.
By Epsilon Relation is Proper, $\struct {\mathbb U, \Epsilon}$ is a proper relational structure, where $\mathbb U$ is the universal class.
By Well-Founded Proper Relational Structure Determines Minimal Elements, $B$ has a strictly minimal element under $\Epsilon$.
$\blacksquare$

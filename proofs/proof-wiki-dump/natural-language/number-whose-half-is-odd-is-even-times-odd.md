Theorem
Let $a \in \Z$ be an integer such that $\dfrac a 2$ is an odd integer.
Then $a$ is even-times odd.

In the words of Euclid:

If a number have its half odd, it is even-times odd only.
(The Elements: Book $\text{IX}$: Proposition $33$)


Proof
By definition:

$a = 2 r$
where $r$ is an odd integer.
Thus:

$a$ has an even divisor
and:

$a$ has an odd divisor.
Hence the result by definition of even-times odd integer.

As $r$ is an odd integer it follows that $2 \nmid r$.
Thus $a$ is not divisible by $4$.
Hence $a$ is not even-times even.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $33$ of Book $\text{IX}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

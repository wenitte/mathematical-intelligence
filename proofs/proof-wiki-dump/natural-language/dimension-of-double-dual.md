Theorem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $G$ be an $n$-dimensional $R$-module.
Let $G^{**}$ be the double dual of $G$.

Then $G^{**}$ is also $n$-dimensional.


Proof
By definition, the double dual of $G$ is the algebraic dual of the algebraic dual $G^*$ of $G$.
From Dimension of Algebraic Dual:

$\map \dim {G^**} = \map \dim {G^*}$
Also from Dimension of Algebraic Dual::

$\map \dim {G^*} = \map \dim G$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Polynomial Time
Consider the process of squaring an $n$-digit integer using the basic computational steps:

addition of $2$ digits
multiplication of $2$ digits.
This squaring process runs in polynomial time.


Proof
By the classical multiplication algorithm it is seen that the squaring process takes fewer than $4 n^2$ steps.
Hence the result by definition of polynomial time: $A = 4$ and $k = 2$.
$\blacksquare$

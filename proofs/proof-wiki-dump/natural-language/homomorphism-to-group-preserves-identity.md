Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be an algebraic structure.
Let $\struct {T, *}$ be a group.
Let $\phi: \struct {S, \circ} \to \struct {T, *}$ be a homomorphism.
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ have an identity $e_S$.

Then:

$\map \phi {e_S} = e_T$


Proof
By hypothesis, $\struct {T, *}$ is a group.
By the Cancellation Laws, all elements of $T$ are cancellable.
Thus Homomorphism with Cancellable Codomain Preserves Identity can be applied.
$\blacksquare$

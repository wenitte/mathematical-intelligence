Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a finite complement topology on an uncountable set $S$.
Let $U \in \tau$ be an open set of $T$.

Then $U$ is not an $F_\sigma$ set.


Proof
Let $U$ be an open set of $T$.
As $S$ is uncountable, then so is $U$.
By the definition of a finite complement topology, all closed sets of $T$ are finite.
From Countable Union of Countable Sets is Countable, $U$ can not be expressed as the union of a countable number of closed sets.
So by definition $U$ is not an $F_\sigma$ set.
$\blacksquare$

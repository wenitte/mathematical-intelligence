Problem
Throw me in, silversmith, besides the bowl itself,
the third of its weight,
and the fourth,
and the twelfth;
and casting them into the furnace stir them, and mixing them all up take out, please, the mass, and let it weigh one mina.


Solution
Let $w$ be the weight in minae of the bowl.
We have:














\(\ds w + \frac w 3 + \frac w 4 + \frac w {12}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 12 w + 4 w + 3 w + w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)





multiplying through by $12$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 20 w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12} {20}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 3 5\)









Thus the bowl weighs $\dfrac 3 5$ of a mina.
Assuming $100$ drachmae to the mina, that is, $60$ drachmae.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $I \subseteq \R$ be a real interval.
Let $f: I \to \R$ be an absolutely continuous real function.
Then $f$ is continuous.


Proof
From Absolutely Continuous Real Function is Uniformly Continuous:

$f$ is uniformly continuous.
Therefore, from Uniformly Continuous Real Function is Continuous:

$f$ is continuous.

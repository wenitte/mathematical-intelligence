Theorem
Let $\cos t$ be the cosine of $t$, where $t \in \R$.

Then $\cos t$ is of exponential order $0$.


Proof









\(\ds \forall t \ge 1: \, \)



\(\ds \size {\cos t}\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds 1\)





Real Cosine Function is Bounded








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \size {\cos t}\)

\(<\)







\(\ds 2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 e^{0 t}\)





Exponential of Zero



The result follows from the definition of exponential order with $M = 1$, $K = 2$, and $a = 0$.

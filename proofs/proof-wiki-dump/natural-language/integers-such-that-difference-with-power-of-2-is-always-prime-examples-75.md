Example of Integers such that Difference with Power of 2 is always Prime
The positive integer $75$ has the property that such that:

$\forall k > 0: 75 - 2^k$
is prime whenever it is (strictly) positive.


Proof













\(\ds 75 - 2^1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 73\)





which is prime














\(\ds 75 - 2^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 71\)





which is prime














\(\ds 75 - 2^3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 67\)





which is prime














\(\ds 75 - 2^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 59\)





which is prime














\(\ds 75 - 2^5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 43\)





which is prime














\(\ds 75 - 2^6\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 11\)





which is prime














\(\ds 75 - 2^7\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -53\)





which is not positive



$\blacksquare$

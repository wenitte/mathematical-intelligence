Hexagon to Square
Can you cut a regular hexagon into $5$ pieces that will fit together to form a square?


Solution

Cut the hexagon in half along a diagonal and place the two parts together to form the parallelogram $ABCD$.
Construct $CF$ perpendicular to $DC$.
Produce $DC$ to $E$ where $CE = CF$.
Construct the semicircle $DHE$, whose center will be at $G$.
Produce $CF$ to $H$.
We have that $CH^2 = DC \cdot CE$.
We have that $DC \cdot CE$ is the area of the parallelogram $ABCD$, and therefore the original hexagon.
Hence a square whose side is $CH$ will have the same area as that hexagon.
Construct the semicircle $DJC$, whose center will be at $K$.
Construct the arc $HJ$ whose center is at $C$.
Draw $CJ$ and $DJ$.
Construct $LJ = CJ$ and the follows.
The rest explains itself.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
Henry Ernest Dudeney claims that he was the first to publish this construction, citing the Weekly Dispatch for August $1901$.
However, Martin Gardner reports that Victor Meally unearthed the information that in fact it had previously been discovered by Paul Busschop.
This was published in Volume $\text {II}$ of Nouvelle correspondance mathématique in $1875$, on page $83$.

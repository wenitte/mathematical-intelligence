Theorem
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be a linear function of one variable expressed by the equation:

$\map f x = a_0 + a_1 x$
The graph of $f$ in a cartesian plane consists of a straight line:

whose $y$-intercept is $a_0$
whose slope is $a_1$.


Proof
Expressing $f$ in the form $y = \map f x$, we have:

$y = a_0 + a_1 x$
Thus it is in the same form as the slope-intercept form of an equation of a straight line in the plane.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

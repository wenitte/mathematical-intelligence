Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Small Circle are equivalent:

Definition $1$
A small circle on a sphere $S$ is defined as the intersection of $S$ with a plane which does not pass through the center of $S$.

Definition $2$
A small circle on a sphere $S$ is defined as a circle on the surface of $S$ whose center is not at the center of $S$.


Proof
Let $S$ be a sphere.


Definition $(1)$ implies Definition $(2)$
Let $C$ be a small circle on $S$ by definition $1$.

Recall definition $1$ of Small Circle:
A small circle on a sphere $S$ is defined as the intersection of $S$ with a plane which does not pass through the center of $S$.

Definition $(2)$ implies Definition $(1)$
Let $C$ be a small circle on $S$ by definition $2$.

Recall definition $2$ of Small Circle:
A small circle on a sphere $S$ is defined as a circle on the surface of $S$ whose center is not at the center of $S$.

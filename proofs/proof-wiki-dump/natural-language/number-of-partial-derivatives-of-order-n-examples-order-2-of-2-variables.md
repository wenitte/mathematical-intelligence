Examples of Use of Number of Partial Derivatives of Order $n$
Let $u = \map f {x, y}$ be a real function of $2$ variables.
There are $4$ partial derivatives of $u$ of order $2$.

These are:














\(\ds \dfrac {\partial^2 u} {\partial x^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {f_{1 1} } {x, y}\)




















\(\ds \dfrac {\partial^2 u} {\partial y \partial x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {f_{1 2} } {x, y}\)




















\(\ds \dfrac {\partial^2 u} {\partial x \partial y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {f_{2 1} } {x, y}\)




















\(\ds \dfrac {\partial^2 u} {\partial y^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {f_{2 2} } {x, y}\)











Proof
From Number of Partial Derivatives of Order $n$, there are $m^n$ partial derivatives of order $n$ of a function of $m$ independent variables.
In this case, $m = 2$ and $n = 2$.
Thus there are $2^2 = 4$ partial derivatives of $u$ of order $2$.
$\blacksquare$

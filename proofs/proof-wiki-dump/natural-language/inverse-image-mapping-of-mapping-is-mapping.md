Theorem
Let $S$ and $T$ be sets.
Let $f: S \to T$ be a mapping from $S$ to $T$.

Let $f^\gets$ be the inverse image mapping of $f$:

$f^\gets: \powerset T \to \powerset S: \map {f^\gets} Y = f^{-1} \sqbrk Y$

Then $f^\gets$ is indeed a mapping.


Proof
$f^{-1}$ is a relation.
So Inverse Image Mapping of Relation is Mapping applies directly.
$\blacksquare$

Inverse of Direct Image Mapping does not necessarily equal Inverse Image Mapping

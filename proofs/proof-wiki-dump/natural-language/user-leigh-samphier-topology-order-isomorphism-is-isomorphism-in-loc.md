Theorem
Let $\mathbf{Loc_*}$ denote the category of locales with localic mappings.

Let $L_1 = \struct{S_1, \preceq_1}$ and $L_2 = \struct{S_2, \preceq_2}$ be locales.
Let $f:S_1 \to S_2$ be a localic mapping of $\mathbf{Loc_*}$.

Then:

$f$ is an isomorphism of $\mathbf{Loc_*}$ if and only if $f$ is an order isomorphism.


Proof
$\blacksquare$

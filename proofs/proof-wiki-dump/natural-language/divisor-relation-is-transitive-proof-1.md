Theorem
The divisibility relation is a transitive relation on $\Z$, the set of integers.
That is:

$\forall x, y, z \in \Z: x \divides y \land y \divides z \implies x \divides z$


Proof
We have that Integers form Integral Domain.
The result then follows directly from Divisor Relation in Integral Domain is Transitive.
$\blacksquare$

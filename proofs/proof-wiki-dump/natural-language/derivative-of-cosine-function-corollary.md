Corollary to Derivative of Cosine Function
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\cos a x} = -a \sin a x$


Proof













\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\cos x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\sin x\)





Derivative of $\cos x$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\cos a x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -a \sin a x\)

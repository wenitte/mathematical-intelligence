Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau_{_S} }$ be a topological space.
Let $\struct {R, +, *, \tau_{_R} }$ be a topological division ring.

Let $g: \struct {S, \tau_{_S} } \to \struct {R, \tau_{_R} }$ be a continuous mapping.

Let $-gÂ : S \to R$ be the mapping defined by:

$\forall x \in S: \map {\paren {-g} } x = -\map g x$

Then:

$-g: \struct {S, \tau_{_S} } \to \struct {R, \tau_{_R} }$ is continuous.


Proof
By definition of a topological division ring:

$\struct {R, +, *, \tau_{_R} }$ is a topological ring.
From Negation Rule for Continuous Mappings to Topological Ring:

$-g: \struct {S, \tau_{_S} } \to \struct {R, \tau_{_R} }$ is a continuous mapping.
$\blacksquare$

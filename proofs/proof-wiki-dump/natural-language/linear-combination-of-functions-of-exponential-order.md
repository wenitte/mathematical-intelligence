Theorem
Let $f, g: \R \to \F$ be functions, where $\F \in \set {\R, \C}$.
Let $\lambda, \mu$ be complex numbers.

Suppose $f$ is of exponential order $a$ and $g$ is of exponential order $b$.

Then $\map {\paren {\lambda f + \mu g} } t = \lambda \, \map f t + \mu \, \map g t$ is of exponential order $\max \set {a, b}$.


Proof
Follows from:

Scalar Multiple of Function of Exponential Order
Sum of Functions of Exponential Order
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$\ds \map \zeta 2 = \sum_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty {\frac 1 {n^2} } = \frac {\pi^2} 6$
where $\zeta$ denotes the Riemann zeta function.


Proof
From Sum of Reciprocals of Squares of Odd Integers:

$\ds \sum_{n \mathop = 0}^\infty \frac 1 {\paren {2 n + 1}^2} = \frac {\pi^2} 8$

Hence:














\(\ds \sum_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty \frac 1 {n^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sum_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty \frac 1 {\paren {2 n}^2} + \sum_{n \mathop = 0}^\infty \frac 1 {\paren {2 n + 1}^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 4 \sum_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty \frac 1 {n^2} + \frac {\pi^2} 8\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \sum_{n \mathop = 1}^\infty \frac 1 {n^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\pi^2} 6\)

Historical Note
The Basel Problem was first posed by Pietro Mengoli in $1644$.
Its solution is generally attributed to Leonhard Euler , who solved it in $1734$ and delivered a proof in $1735$.
However, it has also been suggested that it was in fact first solved by Nicolaus I Bernoulli.
Jacob Bernoulli had earlier established that the series was convergent, but had failed to work out what to.
The problem is named after Basel, the home town of Euler as well as of the Bernoulli family.

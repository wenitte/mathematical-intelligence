Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $325$
The Price of a Garden
A neighbour told you he was offered a triangular piece of ground for a garden.
Its sides were $55$ yards, $62$ yards and $117$ yards.
The price was $10$ shillings per square yard.
What will its cost be?


Solution
Nothing.


Proof
We have that:

$55 + 62 = 117$
and so a triangle with those sides will have zero area.
Hence and so.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Capture-Recapture Sampling
Let $25$ squirrels be captured, marked and released.
On a later date, let $40$ squirrels be captured and inspected.
Let $5$ of those be ones which were marked on the first capture exercise.

Then a fair estimate of the entire population of squirrels is $200$.


Proof
Let:

$n_1$ be the number of squirrels captured, marked and released on the first round.
$n_2$ be the number of squirrels captured on the second round.
$m$ be the number of marked squirrels in the sample captured on the second round.
Then we have:














\(\ds n_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25\)




















\(\ds n_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40\)




















\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {n_1 n_2} m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 200\)

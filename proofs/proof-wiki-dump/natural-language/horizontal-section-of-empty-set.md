Theorem
Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. 
Let $y \in Y$. 

Then: 

$\O^y = \O$
where $\O$ is the empty set and $\O^y$ is the $y$-horizontal section of $\O$. 


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose suppose that: 

$x \in \O^y$
Then from the definition of the $x$-vertical section, we have: 

$\tuple {x, y} \in \O$
This is impossible from the definition of the empty set.
So:

there exists no $x \in \O^y$
giving:

$\O_x = \O$
$\blacksquare$

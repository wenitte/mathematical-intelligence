Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $28$
Hill Climbing
Weary Willie went up a certain hill at the rate of $1 \tfrac 1 2$ miles per hour
and came down at the rate of $4 \tfrac 1 2$ miles per hour,
so that it took him just $6$ hours to make the double journey.
Now, how far was it to the top of the hill?


Solution
$6 \tfrac 3 4$ miles.
He goes up in $4 \tfrac 1 2$ hours and back down again in $1 \tfrac 1 2$ hours.


Proof
Let $d$ miles be the distance to the top of the hill.
Let $t_1$ be the time taken to reach the top.
Let $t_2$ be the time taken to reach the bottom again.
The assumption has to be that no time is taken to rest at the top.

We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds t_1 + t_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)




















\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t_1 \times 1 \tfrac 1 2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds t_2 \times 4 \tfrac 1 2\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 t_2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 3 t_2 + t_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)





substituting for $t_1$ from $(2)$ into $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 3 2\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 3 2 \times \dfrac 9 2\)





simplifying














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {27} 4\)





simplifying














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \tfrac 3 4\)

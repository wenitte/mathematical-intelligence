Theorem
Let $L = \left({S, \preceq}\right)$ be a bounded below ordered set.
Let $x \in S$.

Then $\bot \in x^{\mathrm{compact} }$
where $\bot$ denotes the smallest element in $L$,

$ x^{\mathrm{compact} }$ denotes the compact closure of $x$.


Proof
By Bottom is Compact:

$\bot$ is a compact element.
By definition of the smallest element:

$\bot \preceq x$
Thus by definition of compact closure:

$\bot \in x^{\mathrm{compact} }$
$\blacksquare$

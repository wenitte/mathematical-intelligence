Theorem
Let $\struct {F, +, \times}$ be a field whose zero is $0$ and whose unity is $1$.
Let $a, b \in F$ such that $a \ne 0$.

Then:

$\paren {a \times b^{-1} }^{-1} = b \times a^{-1}$
This can also be expressed using the notation of division as:

$1 / \paren {a / b} = b / a$


Proof
By definition, a field is a non-trivial division ring whose ring product is commutative.
By definition, a division ring is a ring with unity such that every non-zero element is a unit. 
Hence we can use Inverse of Division Product:

$\paren {\dfrac a b}^{-1} = \dfrac {1_R} {\paren {a / b}} = \dfrac b a$
which applies to the group of units of a comutative ring with unity.

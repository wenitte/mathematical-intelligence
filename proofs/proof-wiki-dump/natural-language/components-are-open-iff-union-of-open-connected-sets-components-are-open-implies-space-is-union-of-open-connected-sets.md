Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let the components of $T$ be open sets.

Then:

$S$ is a union of open connected sets of $T$.


Proof
Let the components of $T$ be open.
By definition, the components of $T$ are a partition of $S$.
Hence $S$ is the union of the open components of $T$.
Since a component is a maximal connected set by definition, then $S$ is a union of open connected sets of $T$.
$\blacksquare$

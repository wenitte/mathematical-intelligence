Theorem
The first order ODE:

$y' = e^x$
has the general solution:

$y = e^x + C$
where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.


Proof













\(\ds y'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^x\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \int \d y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \int e^x \rd x\)





Solution to Separable Differential Equation








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^x + C\)

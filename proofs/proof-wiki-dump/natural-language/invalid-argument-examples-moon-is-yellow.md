Example of Invalid Argument
This argument is invalid:

The moon is yellow.
Therefore, the moon is made of cheese.


Proof
Let $P$ denote the simple statement The moon is yellow..
Let $Q$ denote the simple statement The moon is made of cheese..

The argument can then be expressed as:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds P\)

\(\)







\(\ds \)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \therefore \ \ \)





\(\ds Q\)

\(\)







\(\ds \)










There is nothing connecting the two statements.
Hence this is not a valid argument form.
$\blacksquare$

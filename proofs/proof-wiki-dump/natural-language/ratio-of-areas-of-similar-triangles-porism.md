Porism to Ratio of Areas of Similar Triangles
In the words of Euclid:

From this it is manifest that, if three straight lines be proportional, then, as the first is to the third, so is the figure described on the first to that which is similar and similarly described in the second.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VI}$: Proposition $19$ : Porism)


Proof
Follows immediately from Ratio of Areas of Similar Triangles.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $19$ of Book $\text{VI}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

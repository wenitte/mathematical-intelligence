Theorem
Let $\HH$ be a Hilbert space.
Let $I$ be an identity operator on $\HH$.
Let $A$ be a projection.
Let $B$ be the complementary projection of A.

Then the complementary projection of $B$ is $A$.


Proof
From Complementary Projection is Projection the complementary projection of $B$ is well-defined.

Let $C$ be the complementary projection of $B$.
We have:














\(\ds C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds I - B\)





Definition of Complementary Projection














\(\ds \)

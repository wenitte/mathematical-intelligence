Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $9$
De Sago
A Cloak
I have a cloak, $100$ cubits long and $80$ cubits wide.
I wish to make small cloaks with it, each small cloak $5$ cubits long and $4$ cubits wide.
How many small cloaks can I make?


Solution
$400$.


Proof
It is assumed there is no cloth spent on hems, and the making of a small cloak consists of little more than cutting a piece of cloth to the required size.
We have that:

$5$ goes into $100$ a total of $20$ times
$4$ goes into $80$ also a total of $20$ times.
Thus the cloth can be cut into $20 \times 20 = 400$ pieces that are $5$ cubits long and $4$ cubits wide.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
According to the translator John Hadley, the explanation for the answer given in the original manuscript was "not enlightening".
It is supposed that a scribe may have skipped a line when transcribing it.
The text as given by Bede makes little sense:

The eightieth part of $400$ is $5$ and the hundredth part of $400$ is $4$.
Both eighty $5$s and one hundred $4$s give the same result, $400$.
There are that many cloaks.

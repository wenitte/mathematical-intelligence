Theorem
Let $A$ be a class.
Let $P$ be a proper class.

Then $A$ is proper if and only if there exists a bijection from $P$ to $A$.

From Biconditional is Transitive and Class is Proper iff Bijection from Class to Proper Class, it suffices to show that:

There exists a bijection from $A$ to $P$ if and only if there exists a bijection from $P$ to $A$.

The rest follows from Inverse of Bijection is Bijection.

Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a topological space.
Let $Y$ be an irreducible component of $T$.

Then $Y$ is closed in $T$.

Proof
By Closure of Irreducible Subspace is Irreducible, the closure $Y^-$ of $Y$ is irreducible.
By Set is Subset of its Topological Closure, $Y \subseteq Y^-$.
Because $Y$ is an irreducible component, we must have $Y =  Y^-$.
By Set is Closed iff Equals Topological Closure, $Y$ is closed in $T$.

Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Then:

$\map \nu p = 1$
where $\nu$ denotes the $\nu$ function: the number of types of group of a given order.


Proof
Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be groups of order $p$.
From Prime Group is Cyclic, $G_1$ and $G_2$ are both cyclic groups.
From Cyclic Groups of Same Order are Isomorphic, $G_1$ and $G_2$ are isomorphic.
Thus by definition, $G_1$ and $G_2$ are of the same type.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

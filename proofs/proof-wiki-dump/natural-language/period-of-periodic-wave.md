Theorem
Let $\phi$ be a periodic wave expressed as:

$\forall x, t \in \R: \map \phi {x, t} = \map f {x - c t}$

The period $\tau$ of $\phi$ can be expressed as:

$\tau = \dfrac \lambda c$
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of $\phi$.


Proof
By definition, $\tau$ is the time taken for one complete wavelength of $\phi$ to pass an arbitrary point on the $x$-axis.
We have:

$\map \phi {x, t} = \map f {x - c t} = \map f {x - c t + \lambda}$
It follows that $x - c t$ must pass through a complete cycle of values as $t$ is increased by $\tau$.
Thus:

$\lambda = c \tau$
and so:

$\tau = \dfrac \lambda c$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Examples
Harmonic Wave
Let $\phi$ be a harmonic wave expressed as:

$\forall x, t \in \R: \map \phi {x, t} = a \map \cos {\omega \paren {x - c t} }$

The period $\tau$ of $\phi$ can be expressed as:

$\tau = \dfrac \lambda c$
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of $\phi$.

Example of Use of Number of Significant Figures in Result of Multiplication
$73 \cdotp 24 \times 4 \cdotp 52 = 331$


Proof
We have that:

the number of significant figures $d_m$ in $73 \cdotp 24$ is $4$
the number of significant figures $d_n$ in $4 \cdotp 52$ is $3$

So from Number of Significant Figures in Result of Multiplication:

the number of significant figures in $73 \cdotp 24 \times 4 \cdotp 52$ can be no more than $\min \set {3, 4}$, that is $3$.















\(\ds 73 \cdotp 24 \times 4 \cdotp 52\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 331 \cdotp 0448\)





by calculation














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 331\)





to $3$ significant figures



$\blacksquare$

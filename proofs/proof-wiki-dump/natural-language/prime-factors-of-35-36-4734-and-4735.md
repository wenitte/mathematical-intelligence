Theorem
The integers:

$35, 4374$
have the same prime factors between them as the integers:

$36, 4375$


Proof
We have:














\(\ds 35\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 \times 7\)




















\(\ds 4374\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times 3^7\)
























\(\ds 36\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2^2 \times 3^2\)




















\(\ds 4375\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5^4 \times 7\)










Thus both pairs of integers can be seen to have the same prime factors:

$2, 3, 5, 7$
$\blacksquare$

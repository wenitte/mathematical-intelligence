Example of Use of Equation for Line through Two Points in Complex Plane
Let $L$ be a straight line through $2 + i$ and $3 - 2 i$ in the complex plane.
Then $L$ can be expressed by the equation:

$z - \paren {2 + i} = t \paren {1 - 3 i}$


Proof
From Equation for Line through Two Points in Complex Plane: Parametric Form $1$, a straight line $L$ passing through $2$ points $z_1$ and $z_2$ has the equation:

$z = z_1 + t \paren {z_2 - z_1}$

Hence:














\(\ds z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2 + i} + t \paren {\paren {3 - 2 i} - \paren {2 + i} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2 + i} + t \paren {1 - 3 i}\)





Definition of Complex Subtraction








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds z - \paren {2 + i}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t \paren {1 - 3 i}\)









$\blacksquare$

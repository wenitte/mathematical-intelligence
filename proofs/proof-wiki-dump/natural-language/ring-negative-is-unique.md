Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a ring.
Let $a \in R$.

Then the ring negative $-a$ of $a$ is unique.


Proof
The ring negative is, by definition of a ring, the inverse element of $a$ in the additive group $\struct {R, +}$.
The result then follows from Inverse in Group is Unique.
$\blacksquare$

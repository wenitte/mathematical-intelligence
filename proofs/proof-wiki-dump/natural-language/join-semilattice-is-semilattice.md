Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \vee, \preceq}$ be a join semilattice.

Then $\struct {S, \vee}$ is a semilattice.


Proof
Recall the definition of join semilattice:
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Suppose that for all $a, b \in S$:

$a \vee b \in S$
where $a \vee b$ is the join of $a$ and $b$ with respect to $\preceq$.

Then the ordered structure $\struct {S, \vee, \preceq}$ is called a join semilattice.

By definition of join semilattice, $\vee$ is closed.
The other three defining properties for a semilattice follow respectively from:

Join is Commutative
Join is Associative
Join is Idempotent
Hence $\struct {S, \vee}$ is a semilattice.
$\blacksquare$

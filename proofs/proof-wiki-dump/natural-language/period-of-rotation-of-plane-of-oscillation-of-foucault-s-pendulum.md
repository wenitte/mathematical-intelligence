Theorem
Let $P$ be a Foucault pendulum.
The plane of oscillation of $P$ rotates through a full circle in time $T$, where:

$T = \dfrac D {\sin \lambda}$
where:

$\lambda$ denotes the latitude on Earth at which $P$ is located
$D$ denotes the length of a sidereal day.


Proof
From Angular Speed of Rotation of Plane of Oscillation of Foucault's Pendulum, the angular speed of rotation $\alpha$ of the plane of oscillation of $P$ is given by:

$\alpha = \omega \sin \lambda$
where:

$\lambda$ denotes the latitude on Earth at which $P$ is located
$\omega$ denotes the angular speed of rotation of Earth.
We have:

$D = \dfrac {2 \pi} \omega$
Hence:














\(\ds T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 \pi} \alpha\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 \pi} {\omega \sin \lambda}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac D {\sin \lambda}\)

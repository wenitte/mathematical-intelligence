Examples of Use of Lagrange's Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of $G$ such that:

$\order H = 25$
$\order K = 36$
where $\order {\, \cdot \,}$ denotes the order of the subgroup.
Then:

$\order {H \cap K} = 1$


Proof
From Intersection of Subgroups is Subgroup:

$H \cap K \le H$
and:

$H \cap K \le K$
where $\le$ denotes subgrouphood.

From Lagrange's theorem:

$\order {H \cap K} \divides 25$
and:

$\order {H \cap K} \divides 36$

As $25$ and $36$ are coprime, it follows that:

$\order {H \cap K} = 1$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if it has a closed discrete subgroup.


Proof
Necessary Condition
Follows directly from Topological Group is Hausdorff iff Identity is Closed.

Sufficient Condition
Let $G$ be a Hausdorff topological group.
Let $H \leq G$ be a closed discrete subgroup.
Let $e$ be the identity of $G$.
By Set in Discrete Topology is Clopen, $\left\{{e}\right\}$ is closed in $H$.
By Closed Set in Topological Subspace: Corollary, $\left\{{e}\right\}$ is closed in $G$.
By Topological Group is Hausdorff iff Identity is Closed, $G$ is Hausdorff.
$\blacksquare$

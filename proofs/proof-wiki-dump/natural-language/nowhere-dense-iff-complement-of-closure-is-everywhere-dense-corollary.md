Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $H \subseteq S$.
Let $H$ be a closed set of $T$.

Then $H$ is nowhere dense in $T$ if and only if $S \setminus H$ is everywhere dense in $T$.


Proof
From Closed Set equals its Closure, $H$ is closed in $T$ if and only if:

$H = H^-$
where $H^-$ is the closure of $H$.
The result then follows directly from Nowhere Dense iff Complement of Closure is Everywhere Dense.
$\blacksquare$

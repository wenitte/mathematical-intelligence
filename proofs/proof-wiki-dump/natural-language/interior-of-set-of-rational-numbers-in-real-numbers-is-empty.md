Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.
Let $\Q$ be the subspace of rational numbers.

Then the interior of $\Q$ in $\R$ is the empty set $\O$.


Proof
Consider the set of set of irrational numbers $\R \setminus \Q$.
By definition:

$\R \setminus \Q = \relcomp \R \Q$
where $\relcomp \R \Q$ denotes the relative complement of $\Q$ in $\R$.
We have that Irrationals are Everywhere Dense in Reals.
Hence by definition of everywhere dense, the closure of $\R \setminus \Q$ in $\R$ is $\R$ itself.
By Relative Complement with Self is Empty Set:

$\relcomp \R \R = \O$
The result follows from Interior equals Complement of Closure of Complement.
$\blacksquare$

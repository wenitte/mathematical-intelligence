Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set with greatest element $\top$.
Let $\FF$ be a filter in $\struct{S, \preceq}$.

Then:

$\top \in \FF$


Proof
By Filter Axiom $\paren{1}$:

$\exists x \in \FF$
By definition of greatest element:
$x \preceq \top$
By Filter Axiom $\paren{3}$:

$\top \in \FF$
$\blacksquare$

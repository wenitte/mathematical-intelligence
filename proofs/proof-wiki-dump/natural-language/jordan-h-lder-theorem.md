Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite group.
Let $\HH_1$ and $\HH_2$ be two composition series for $G$.
Then:

$\HH_1$ and $\HH_2$ have the same length
Corresponding factors of $\HH_1$ and $\HH_2$ are isomorphic.


Proof
By the Schreier-Zassenhaus Theorem, two normal series have refinements of equal length whose factors are isomorphic.
But from the definition of composition series, $\HH_1$ and $\HH_2$ have no proper refinements.
Hence any such refinements must be identical to $\HH_1$ and $\HH_2$ themselves.
$\blacksquare$


Source of Name
This entry was named for Marie Ennemond Camille Jordan and Otto Ludwig Hölder.


Historical Note
The Jordan-Hölder Theorem was proved by Camille Jordan in $1869$, and then independently rediscovered by Otto Ludwig Hölder in $1889$.

Theorem
Let $\C$ be the set of complex numbers.
Let $\size {\, \cdot \,}$ be the complex modulus.

Then $\struct {\C, \size {\, \cdot \,}}$ is a normed vector space.


Proof
We have that:

Complex Numbers form Vector Space over Themselves
Complex Modulus is Norm
By definition, $\struct {\C, \size {\, \cdot \,}}$ is a normed vector space.
$\blacksquare$

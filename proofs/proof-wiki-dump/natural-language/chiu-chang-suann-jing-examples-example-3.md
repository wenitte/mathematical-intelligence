Example of Problem from Chiu Chang Suann Jing
A number of men bought a number of articles, neither of which are known;
it is only known that if each man paid $8$ cash, there would be a surplus of $3$ cash,
and if each man paid $7$ cash, there would be a deficiency of $4$ cash.
Required the respective numbers?


Solution
There are $7$ men and $53$ objects.


Proof
Let $m$ be the number of men.
Let $p$ be the number of objects.
It is assumed that the objects each cost $1$ cash each.

Then:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 8 m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds p + 3\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 7 m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds p - 4\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7\)





$(1) - (2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p - 4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 49\)





substituting back into $2$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 53\)









$\blacksquare$

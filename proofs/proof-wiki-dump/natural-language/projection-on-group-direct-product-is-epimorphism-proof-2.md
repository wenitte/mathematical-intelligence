Theorem
Let $\struct {G_1, \circ_1}$ and $\struct {G_2, \circ_2}$ be groups.
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be the group direct product of $\struct {G_1, \circ_1}$ and $\struct {G_2, \circ_2}$.

Then:

$\pr_1$ is an epimorphism from $\struct {G, \circ}$ to $\struct {G_1, \circ_1}$
$\pr_2$ is an epimorphism from $\struct {G, \circ}$ to $\struct {G_2, \circ_2}$
where $\pr_1$ and $\pr_2$ are the first and second projection respectively of $\struct {G, \circ}$.


Proof
A specific instance of Projection is Epimorphism, where the algebraic structures in question are groups.

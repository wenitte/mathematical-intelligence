Example of Image of Element under Mapping
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be the mapping defined as:

$\forall x \in \R: \map f x = x^2 - 4 x + 5$

The image of $f$ is the unbounded closed interval:

$\Img f = \hointr 1 \to$
and so $f$ is not a surjection.

Proof
By differentiating $x^2 - 4 x + 5$ twice with respect to $x$:

$f' = 2 x - 4$
$f' = 2 x - 4$













\(\ds f'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 x - 4\)




















\(\ds f\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)









Equating $f'$ to $0$, a stationary point is found at $x = 2$.
Inspecting the sign of $f$, it is noted that $f'$ is increasing everywhere.
Hence the stationary point at $x = 2$ is a minimum of $\Img f$.
This is the only stationary point, so it can be stated that the minimum of $f$ occurs at $x = 2$.
We have that:

$f \paren 2 = 2^2 - 4 \times 2 + 5 = 4 - 8 + 5 = 1$

As $f$ is strictly increasing on $x > 2$ and strictly decreasing on $x < 2$, it is seen that $f$ is unbounded above.
Thus:

$\Img f = \hointr 1 \to$
$\blacksquare$

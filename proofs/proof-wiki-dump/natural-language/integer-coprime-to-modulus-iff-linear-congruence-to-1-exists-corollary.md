Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
The linear congruence:

$a x \equiv 1 \pmod p$
has a solution $x$ if and only if $a \not \equiv 0 \pmod p$.


Proof
By definition of congruence:

$a \not \equiv 0 \pmod p \iff p \nmid a$
where $p \nmid a$ denotes that $p$ is not a divisor of $a$.

From Prime not Divisor implies Coprime:

$p \nmid a \iff p \perp a$
where $p \perp a$ denotes that $p$ and $a$ are coprime.

The result follows from Integer Coprime to Modulus iff Linear Congruence to 1 exists.

Theorem
There exists at least one example of a topological space for which none of the Tychonoff separation axioms are satisfied except for the $T_4$ axiom.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a countable complement topology on an uncountable set $S$.
Let $D = \struct {\set {0, 1}, \vartheta}$ be the indiscrete topology on two points.
Let $T \times D$ be the double pointed topology on $T$.
Let $\paren {T \times D}^*_{\bar p}$ be the open extension topology on $S \times \set {0, 1} \cup \set p$ where $p \notin S \times \set {0, 1}$.
From Open Extension of Double Pointed Countable Complement Topology is $T_4$ Space, we have that $\paren {T \times D}^*_{\bar p}$ satisfies none of the Tychonoff separation axioms except for the $T_4$ axiom.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Then:

$\forall x \in \Z, 0 < x < p: x \perp p$
That is, $p$ is relatively prime to all smaller (strictly) positive integers.


Proof
From Prime not Divisor implies Coprime, if $p$ does not divide an integer $x$, it is relatively prime to $x$.
From Absolute Value of Integer is not less than Divisors: Corollary, $p$ does not divide an integer smaller than $p$.
It follows that $p$ is relatively prime to all smaller (strictly) positive integers.
The special case when $x = 0$ is excluded as from Integers Coprime to Zero, $p$ is not relatively prime to $0$.
$\blacksquare$

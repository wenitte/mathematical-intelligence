Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a division ring with norm $\norm {\,\cdot\,}_R$.
Let $V$ be a vector space over $R$.
Let $\norm \cdot$ be a norm on $V$.

Then $\norm \cdot$ is a quasinorm on $V$.


Proof

Although this article appears correct, it's inelegant. There has to be a better way of doing it.In particular: In order to make it completely clear what is being proven here, especially with the labels identifying the axioms, I have started a style in which those axioms are repeated at the top of the question: "Recall what we are to prove" or however to word it. This is made easier if the axioms are in a separately transcluded subpage, then all you need to do is use the transclusion mechanism.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by redesigning it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Improve}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Proof of $(\text Q 1)$
This is precisely $(\text N 2)$ in the definition of a norm. 
$\Box$

Proof of $(\text Q 2)$
Since $\norm \cdot$ is a norm on $V$, we have: 

$\norm {x + y} \le \norm x + \norm y$
for all $x, y \in V$. 
In particular, there exists an $M \ge 1$ with: 

$\norm {x + y} \le M \paren {\norm x + \norm y}$
So $(\text Q 2)$ holds. 
$\blacksquare$

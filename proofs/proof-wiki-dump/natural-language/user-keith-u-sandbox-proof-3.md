Theorem
Let $x$ be a real number.
Let $\exp$ denote the  (real) Exponential Function.

Then:

$\forall x \in \RÂ : \exp x > 0$


Proof
This proof assumes the  definition of $\exp x$ as the unique continuous extension of $e^x$.

Since $e > 0$, the result follows immediately from  Power of Positive Real Number is Positive.

Theorem
Let:

$\struct {G_1, \circ}$
$\struct {G_2, *}$
$\struct {G_3, \oplus}$
be groups.
Let:

$\phi: \struct {G_1, \circ} \to \struct {G_2, *}$
$\psi: \struct {G_2, *} \to \struct {G_3, \oplus}$
be monomorphisms.

Then the composite of $\phi$ and $\psi$ is also a monomorphism.


Proof
A monomorphism is a homomorphism which is also an injection.

From Composite of Group Homomorphisms is Homomorphism, $\psi \circ \phi$ is a homomorphism.
From Composite of Injections is Injection, $\psi \circ \phi$ is an injection.
$\blacksquare$

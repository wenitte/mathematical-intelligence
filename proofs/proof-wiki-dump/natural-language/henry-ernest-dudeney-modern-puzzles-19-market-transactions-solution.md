Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $19$
Market Transactions
A farmer goes to market and buys $100$ animals at a total cost of $\pounds 100$.
The price of cows being $\pounds 5$ each,
sheep $\pounds 1$ each,
and rabbits $1 \shillings$ each,
how many of each kind does he buy?


Solution
$19$ cows, $1$ sheep and $80$ rabbits.


Proof
Recall:

$1$ pound sterling ($\pounds 1$) is $20$ shillings ($20 \shillings$)
Let all prices be expressed, therefore, in shillings.
Thus:

the price of cows is $5 \times 20 = 100 \shillings$ each
the price of sheep is $20 \shillings$ each
the price of rabbits is $1 \shillings$ each
and:

the total amount of money to spend is $100 \times 20 = 2000 \shillings$.
Let $c$, $s$ and $r$ denote the number of cows, sheep and rabbits respectively.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 100 c + 20 s + r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2000\)





the amount spent




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds c + s + r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





the total number of animals








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 99 c + 19 s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1900\)





$(1) - (2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 1900 - 99 c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 19 s\)









Note that both $c$ and $s$ need to be positive.
We need to find possible values of $c$ such that $1900 - 99 c$ is divisible by $19$.
This can happen only when $c$ itself is divisible by $19$.










\(\ds c = 0: \, \)



\(\ds 1900 - 99 \times 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1900\)

\(\ds = 19 \times 100\)














\(\ds c = 19: \, \)



\(\ds 1900 - 99 \times 19\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 19\)

\(\ds = 19 \times 1\)








It is implicit that there are at least some cows are bought, so the solution:

$c = 0, s = 100, r = 0$
is usually ruled out.
Hence we have:

$c = 19, s = 1, r = 80$
$\blacksquare$

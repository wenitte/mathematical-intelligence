Theorem
All groups with less than $6$ elements are abelian.


Proof
Let $G$ be a non-abelian group.
From Non-Abelian Group has Order Greater than 4, the order of $G$ must be at least $5$.
But $5$ is a prime number.
By Prime Group is Cyclic it follows that a group of order $5$ is cyclic.
By Cyclic Group is Abelian this group is abelian.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\BB$ b a countable basis for $\tau$
Let:

$\AA = \set{\tuple{U,V} : U, V \in \BB : U^- \subseteq V}$
where $U^-$ denotes the closure of $U$ in $T$.

Then: 

$\AA$ is countable


Proof
We have:

$\AA \subseteq \BB \times \BB$
where $\BB \times \BB$ is the Cartesian product of $\BB$ with itself.
From Cartesian Product of Countable Sets is Countable:

$\BB \times \BB$ is countable
From Subset of Countable Set is Countable:

$\AA$ is countable
$\blacksquare$

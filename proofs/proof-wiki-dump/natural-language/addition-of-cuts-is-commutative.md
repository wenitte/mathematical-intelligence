Theorem
Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be cuts.
Let the operation of $\alpha + \beta$ be the sum of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Then:

$\alpha + \beta = \beta + \alpha$


Proof
$\alpha + \beta$ is the set of all rational numbers of the form $p + q$ such that $p \in \alpha$ and $q \in \beta$.
Similarly, $\beta + \alpha$ is the set of all rational numbers of the form $q + p$ such that $p \in \alpha$ and $q \in \beta$.
From Rational Addition is Commutative we have that:

$p + q = q + p$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

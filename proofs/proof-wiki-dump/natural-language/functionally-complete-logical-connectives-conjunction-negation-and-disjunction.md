Theorem
The set of logical connectives:

$\set {\neg, \land, \lor}$: Not, And and Or
is functionally complete.


Proof
From the stronger results:

Functionally Complete Logical Connectives: Negation and Disjunction:
the set of logical connectives: $\set {\neg, \lor}$ is functionally complete
Functionally Complete Logical Connectives: Negation and Conjunction:
the set of logical connectives: $\set {\neg, \land}$ is functionally complete
it follows directly that $\set {\neg, \land, \lor}$ is likewise functionally complete.
$\blacksquare$

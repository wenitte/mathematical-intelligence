Examples of Use of Cardinality of Set of Bijections
Let $S$ be a set whose cardinality is $4$:

$\card S = 4$
Then there are $24$ bijections from $S$ to itself.


Proof
Let $T$ be the set of bijections from $S$ to itself.
From Cardinality of Set of Bijections:

$\card T = \paren {\card S}!$
The result follows by Examples of Factorials.
$\blacksquare$

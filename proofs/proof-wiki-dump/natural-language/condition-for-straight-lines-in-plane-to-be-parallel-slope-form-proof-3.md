Theorem
Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be straight lines in the Cartesian plane.
Let the slope of $L_1$ and $L_2$ be $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ respectively.

Then $L_1$ is parallel to $L_2$ if and only if:

$\mu_1 = \mu_2$


Proof
Let $\psi$ be the angle between $L_1$ and $L_2$
When $L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel:

$\psi = 0$
by definition.
From Angle between Straight Lines in Plane:

$\psi = \arctan \dfrac {m_1 - m_2} {1 + m_1 m_2}$
The result follows immediately.
$\blacksquare$

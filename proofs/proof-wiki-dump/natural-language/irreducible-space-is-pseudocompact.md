Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is irreducible.

Then $T$ is pseudocompact.


Proof
We have that Continuous Real-Valued Function on Irreducible Space is Constant.
A constant mapping is trivially bounded.
Hence the result by definition of pseudocompact.
$\blacksquare$

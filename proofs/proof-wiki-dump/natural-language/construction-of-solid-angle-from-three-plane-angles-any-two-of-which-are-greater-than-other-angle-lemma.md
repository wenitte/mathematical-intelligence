Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

But how it is possible to take the square on $OR$ equal to that area by which the square on $AB$ is greater than the square on $LO$, we can show as follows.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XI}$: Proposition $23$ : Lemma)


Proof

Let the straight lines $AB$ and $LO$ be set out.
Le $AB > LO$.
Let the semicircle $ACB$ be described on $AB$.


Using Proposition $1$ of Book $\text{IV} $: Fitting Chord Into Circle:

Let $AC = LO$ be fitted into the semicircle $ACB$.
Let $BC$ be joined.
From Proposition $31$ of Book $\text{III} $: Relative Sizes of Angles in Segments:

$\angle ACB$ is a right angle.
Therefore from Proposition $47$ of Book $\text{I} $: Pythagoras's Theorem:

$AB^2 = AC^2 + CB^2$
Hence:

$AB^2 - AC^2 = CB^2$
But $AC = LO$.
Therefore:

$AB^2 - LO^2 = CB^2$
So if we then cut of $OR = BC$:

$AB^2 - LO^2 = OR^2$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $23$ of Book $\text{XI}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

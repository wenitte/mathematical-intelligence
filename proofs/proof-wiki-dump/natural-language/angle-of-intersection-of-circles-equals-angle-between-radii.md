Theorem
Let $\CC$ and $\CC'$ be circles whose centers are at $C$ and $C'$ respectively.
Let $\CC$ and $\CC'$ intersect at $A$ and $B$.

The angle of intersection of $\CC$ and $\CC'$ is equal to the angle between the radii to the point of intersection.


Proof
From Normal to Circle passes through Center, the straight line passing through the center of a circle is normal to that circle.
Hence the radii $CA$ and $C'A$ are perpendicular to the tangents to $\CC$ and $\CC'$ respectively.




Thus, with reference to the above diagram, we have that:

$\angle FAC = \angle DAC'$
as both are right angles.
Hence:














\(\ds \angle FAC'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle FAC + \angle CAC'\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle FAD + \angle DAC'\)





from above








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \angle FAC + \angle CAC'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle FAD + \angle FAC\)





as $\angle FAC = \angle DAC'$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \angle FAD\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle CAC'\)









Hence the result.

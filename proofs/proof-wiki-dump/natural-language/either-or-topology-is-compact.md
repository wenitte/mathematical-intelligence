Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be the either-or space.

Then $T$ is a compact space.


Proof
Any open cover $\CC$ of $T$ must contain an open set of $T$ which contains $0$.
So $\openint {-1} 1$ will always be covered by one set in $\CC$, leaving just $-1$ and $1$ possibly needing to be included in at most two other sets.
So $\CC$ has a subcover containing at most three sets.
Hence $T$ is a compact space by definition.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\left({x, y, z}\right)$ be a Pythagorean triple, that is, integers such that $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$.
Then $x$ and $y$ are of opposite parity.


Proof
From Smaller Elements of Pythagorean Triple not both Odd, $x$ and $y$ are not both odd.

Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $x$ and $y$ are both even.
Then by definition they have $2$ as a common divisor.
But from Elements of Primitive Pythagorean Triple are Pairwise Coprime this cannot be the case.
So by Proof by Contradiction, $x$ and $y$ cannot both be even.
It follows that $x$ and $y$ are of opposite parity.
$\blacksquare$

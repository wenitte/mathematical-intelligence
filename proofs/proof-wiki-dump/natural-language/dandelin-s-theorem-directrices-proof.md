Theorem
Let $\CC$ be a double napped right circular cone with apex $O$.
Let $\PP$ be a plane which intersects $\CC$ such that:

$\PP$ does not pass through $O$
$\PP$ is not perpendicular to the axis of $\CC$.
Let $\EE$ be the conic section arising as the intersection between $\PP$ and $\CC$.
Let $\SS$ and $\SS'$ be the Dandelin spheres with respect to $\PP$.
Then:
Let $\KK$ and $\KK'$ be the planes in which the ring-contacts of $\CC$ with $\SS$ and $\SS'$ are embedded respectively.

The intersections of $\KK$ and $\KK'$ with $\PP$ form the directrices of $\EE$.


Proof
Let $\SS$ and $\SS'$ be the Dandelin spheres with respect to $\PP$.
Let $P$ be a point on $\EE$.
Let $F$ and $F'$ be the points at which $\SS$ and $\SS'$ are tangent to $\PP$ respectively.
Let the generatrix of $\CC$ which passes through $P$ touch $\SS$ and $\SS'$ at $E$ and $E'$ respectively.

Let $\theta$ be half the opening angle of $\CC$.
Let $\phi$ be the inclination of $\PP$ to the axis of $\CC$.

Let $\PP$ intersect $\KK$ in the straight line $NX$.
Let $PN$ be constructed perpendicular to $NX$.
Let $PK$ be constructed perpendicular to $\KK$.
Then:

$PK = PN \cos \phi$
Also:

$PK = PE \cos \theta = PF \cos \theta$
Hence:

$\dfrac {PF} {PN} = \dfrac {\cos \phi} {\cos \theta}$
which is constant.
Hence $NX$ is a directrix of $\EE$ by definition.

A similar argument and construction applies with respect to $\SS'$ and $\KK$.

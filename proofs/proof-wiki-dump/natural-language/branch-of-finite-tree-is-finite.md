Theorem
Let $T$ be a finite rooted tree with root node $r_T$.
Let $\Gamma$ be a branch of $T$.

Then $\Gamma$ is a finite branch.


Proof
Let $\Gamma$ be a branch of a finite rooted tree $T$.
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $\Gamma$ were an infinite branch of $T$.
By definition $\Gamma$ contains an infinite number of nodes.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Technically, from the definition currently posted, it doesn't - that still needs to be demonstrated.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
From Subset of Finite Set is Finite, it follows that $\Gamma$ has a finite number of nodes.
From this contradiction it follows that $\Gamma$ can not be an infinite branch of $T$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\RR$ be an equivalence relation on $S$.
Let $x, y \in S$.
The following statements are equivalent:

$(1): \quad x$ and $y$ are in the same $\RR$-class
$(2): \quad \eqclass x \RR = \eqclass y \RR$


Proof
By Equivalence Class is Unique:

$\eqclass x \RR$ is the unique $\RR$-class to which $x$ belongs
and:

$\eqclass y \RR$ is the unique $\RR$-class to which $y$ belongs.
As these are unique for each, they must be the same set.
$\blacksquare$

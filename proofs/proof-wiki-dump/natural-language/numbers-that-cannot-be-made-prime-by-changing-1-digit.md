Theorem
The following positive integers cannot be made into prime numbers by changing just one digit:

$200, 202, 204, 205, 206, 208, \ldots$
This sequence is A192545 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (N. J. A. Sloane (Ed.), 2008).


Proof
In order to make any one of these positive integers into a prime number one would have to change the last digit.
Otherwise the number it was changed into would be either even, or divisible by $5$, and so not prime.
But all the other integers between $200$ and $209$ are composite:














\(\ds 201\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 67\)




















\(\ds 203\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \times 29\)




















\(\ds 207\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3^2 \times 23\)




















\(\ds 209\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 11 \times 19\)









In order for there to be a smaller number with this property, a prime gap would need to be found which spans an entire decade.
There are none such.

On the other hand, each of $201, 203, 207, 209$ can themselves be turned into a prime number by changing the initial $2$ into a $1$:

$101, 103, 107,109$
are all prime.

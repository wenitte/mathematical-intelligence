Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
The Feuerbach circle of $\triangle ABC$ is tangent to:

the incircle of $\triangle ABC$
and:

the $3$ excircles of $\triangle ABC$.





Proof
Recall the Third Fontené Theorem:

the pedal circle of a point $P$ is tangent to the nine point circle
if and only if:

$P$ and its isogonal conjugate $P^{-1}$ lie on a line through the circumcenter.

Let $P$ be either the incenter or an excenter of $\triangle ABC$.
By Isogonal Conjugate of Incenter or Excenter is Itself, we have $P = P^{-1}$.
As $P$ and $P^{-1}$ are the same point, they both trivially lie on a straight line through the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$.

Hence by the Third Fontené Theorem the pedal circle of $P$ is tangent to the nine point circle.
Then from: 

Pedal Circle of Incenter is Incircle
Pedal Circle of Excenter is Excircle
the result follows. 
$\blacksquare$

Source of Name
This entry was named for Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach.


Historical Note
Feuerbach's Theorem was proved in $1822$ by Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach.
This was two years after Jean-Victor Poncelet and Charles Julien Brianchon had demonstrated the existence of the nine point circle, now known as the Feuerbach circle.

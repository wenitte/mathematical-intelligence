Theorem
Let $G$ be a non-zero-sum game for $n$ players.
Then $G$ can be modelled as a zero-sum game for $n + 1$ players.


Proof
At each outcome, the total payoff of $G$ will be an amount which will (for at least one outcome) not be zero
Let an $n + 1$th player be introduced to $G$ who has one move:

$(1): \quad$ Select any player $m$.
$(2): \quad$ If the total payoff of $G$ is $+k$, receive in payment $k$ from player $m$.
$(3): \quad$ If the total payoff of $G$ is $-k$, pay $k$ to player $m$.
This new game is the same as $G$ but with an extra (dummy) player, and is now zero-sum.
$\blacksquare$


Examples
Casino
Consider a casino with $n$ players.
This is a non-zero-sum game.
However, if you add the banker as the $n + 1$th player, this then becomes a zero-sum game.

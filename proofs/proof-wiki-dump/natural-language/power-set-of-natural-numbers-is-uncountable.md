Theorem
The power set $\powerset \N$ of the natural numbers $\N$ is uncountable.


Proof
There is no bijection from a set to its power set.
From Injection from Set to Power Set, we have that there exists an injection $f: \N \to \powerset \N$.
From the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder Theorem, there can be no injection $g: \powerset \N \to \N$.
So, by definition, $\powerset \N$ is uncountable.
$\blacksquare$

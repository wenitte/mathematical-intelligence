Theorem
Let $G$ be a topological group.
Let $H\leq G$ be an open subgroup.

Then $H$ is closed.


Proof
By Right and Left Regular Representations in Topological Group are Homeomorphisms, the left cosets of $H$ are open.
By Left Coset Space forms Partition, the complement of $H$ is a union of left cosets of $H$.
Because the complement of $H$ is open, $H$ is closed.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\Q_p$ be the $p$-adic numbers for some prime $p$.
Let $\Z_p$ be the $p$-adic integers.

Then:

$\Z_p$ is an integral domain
Proof
From Field is Integral Domain:

$\Q_p$ is an  integral domain
From P-adic Integers is Valuation Ring Induced by P-adic Norm/Corollary:

$\Z_p$ is a local ring
By the definition of local ring:

$\Z_p$ is a ring with unity
From Subdomain Test:

$\Z_p$ is an integral domain
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The complex modulus is a norm on the set of complex numbers $\C$.


Proof
We prove the norm axioms.

Positive Definiteness
This is demonstrated in:

Complex Modulus equals Zero iff Zero
Complex Modulus is Non-Negative
$\Box$


Multiplicativity
Follows from Modulus of Product.
$\Box$


Triangle Inequality
Follows from Triangle Inequality for Complex Numbers.
$\blacksquare$

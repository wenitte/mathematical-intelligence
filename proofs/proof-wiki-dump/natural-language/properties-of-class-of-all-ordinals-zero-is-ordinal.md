Theorem
Let $\On$ denote the class of all ordinals.

The natural number $0$ is an element of $\On$.


Proof
We have the result that Class of All Ordinals is Minimally Superinductive over Successor Mapping.
Hence $\On$ is a fortiori a superinductive class with respect to the successor mapping.
Hence, by definition of superinductive class:

$\O \in \On$
We identify the natural number $0$ via the von Neumann construction of the natural numbers as:

$0 := \O$
and the result follows.

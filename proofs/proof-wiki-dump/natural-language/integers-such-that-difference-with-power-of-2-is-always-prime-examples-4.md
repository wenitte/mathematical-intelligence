Example of Integers such that Difference with Power of 2 is always Prime
The positive integer $4$ has the property that such that:

$\forall k > 0: 4 - 2^k$
is prime whenever it is (strictly) positive.


Proof













\(\ds 4 - 2^1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)





which is prime














\(\ds 4 - 2^0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





which is not (strictly) positive



$\blacksquare$

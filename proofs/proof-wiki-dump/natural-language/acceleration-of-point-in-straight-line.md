Theorem
Let $\mathbf a$ be the acceleration of a particle $P$ in space.
Let $P$ be moving along a straight line $\LL$ whose positive direction has been established.

Then the motion of $P$ can be defined by:

$\mathbf a = \dfrac {\d^2 s} {\d t^2} \mathbf i$
where $\mathbf i$ denotes the unit vector in the positive direction of $\LL$.


Proof
We have by hypothesis that $P$ moves along a straight line $\LL$.
Then the rate of change of displacement perpendicular to $\LL$ is zero.

Let the $\LL$ be embedded in a Cartesian space $\CC$.
From the components of acceleration vector, we have:

$\mathbf a = \dfrac {\d \mathbf v} {\d t} = \dfrac {\d^2 \mathbf r} {\d t^2}$
where:

$\mathbf v$ is the velocity of $P$ at time $t$
$\mathbf r$ is the displacement of $P$ at time $t$ expressed as a position vector from a given origin.
Thus:

$\mathbf a = \dfrac {\d^2 x} {\d t^2} \mathbf i + \dfrac {\d^2 x} {\d t^2} \mathbf j + \dfrac {\d^2 x} {\d t^2} \mathbf k$
where:

$\mathbf r = x \mathbf i + y \mathbf j + z \mathbf k$

Let us define $\CC$ such that $\LL$ is parallel to the $x$-axis of $\CC$.
Then we have:














\(\ds \mathbf v\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\d x} {\d t} \mathbf i + \dfrac {\d y} {\d t} \mathbf j + \dfrac {\d z} {\d t} \mathbf k\)





Definition of Velocity














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\d x} {\d t} \mathbf i + 0 \mathbf j + 0 \mathbf k\)





as the $y$-axis and $z$-axis are perpendicular to $\LL$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \mathbf a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\d^2 x} {\d t} \mathbf i\)

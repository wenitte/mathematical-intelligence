Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a Hausdorff space which is compact.

Then $T$ is locally compact.


Proof 1
By Compact Space is Weakly Locally Compact, $T$ is weakly locally compact.
Thus $T$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
By Neighborhood in Compact Hausdorff Space Contains Compact Neighborhood, every point has a neighborhood basis of compact sets.
$\blacksquare$

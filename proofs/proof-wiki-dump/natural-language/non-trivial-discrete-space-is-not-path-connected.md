Corollary to Non-Trivial Discrete Space is not Connected
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a non-trivial discrete topological space.

$T$ is not path-connected.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $T$ is path-connected.
From Path-Connected Space is Connected, we have that $T$ is connected.
But this directly contradicts Non-Trivial Discrete Space is not Connected.
The result follows from Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S \subseteq \N_{>0}$.
Then, despite Non-Empty Subset of Initial Segment of Natural Numbers has Greatest Element, it is not necessarily the case that $S$ has a greatest element.


Proof
Let:

$S = \set {x \in \N_{>0}: x > 1}$
Then $S \subseteq \N_{>0}$.
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $S$ has a greatest element.
Let the greatest element of $S$ be $k$.
But $\N_{>0}$ is an inductive set.
Therefore $k + 1 \in \N_{>0}$.
By definition of $S$:

$k + 1 \in S$
Therefore $k$ cannot be the greatest element of $S$.
By Proof by Contradiction it follows that $S$ has no greatest element.
It is not possible to apply Non-Empty Subset of Initial Segment of Natural Numbers has Greatest Element, because $S$ is not a subset of an initial segment of $\N_{>0}$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$\aleph_0 < \mathfrak c$
where

$\aleph$ denotes the aleph mapping,
$\mathfrak c$ denotes the cardinality of the continuum.


Proof
By Power Set of Natural Numbers has Cardinality of Continuum:

$\mathfrak c = \card {\powerset \N}$
where:

$\powerset \N$ denotes the power set of $\N$
$\card {\powerset \N}$ denotes the cardinality of $\powerset \N$.
By Cardinality of Set less than Cardinality of Power Set:

$\card \N < \card {\powerset \N}$
Thus by Aleph Zero equals Cardinality of Naturals:

$\aleph_0 < \mathfrak c$
$\blacksquare$

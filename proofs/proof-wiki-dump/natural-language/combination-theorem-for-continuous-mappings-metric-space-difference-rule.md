Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space.
Let $\R$ denote the real numbers.
Let $f: M \to \R$ and $g: M \to \R$ be real-valued functions from $M$ to $\R$ which are continuous on $M$.

Then:

$f - g$ is ‎continuous on $M$.


Proof
$\map {\paren {f - g} } x = \map {\paren {f + \paren {-g} } } x$
From Multiple Rule for Continuous Mappings on Metric Space:

$-g$ is ‎continuous on $M$.
From Sum Rule for Continuous Mappings on Metric Space:

$f + \paren {-g}$ is ‎continuous on $M$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

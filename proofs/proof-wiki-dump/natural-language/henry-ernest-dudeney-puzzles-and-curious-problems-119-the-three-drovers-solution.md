Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $119$
The Three Drovers
Three drovers with varied flocks met on the highway.
Said Jack to Jim: "If I give you six pigs for a horse then you will have twice as many animals in your drove as I will have in mine."
Said Dan to Jack: "If I give you fourteen sheep for a horse, then you'll have three times as many animals as I have got."
Said Jim to Dan: "But if I give you four cows for a horse, then you'll have six times as many animals as I."
There were no deals; but can you tell me how many animals there were in the three droves?


Solution
Jack had $11$ animals, Jim had $7$, and Dan had $21$.


Proof
Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be the numbers of animals in each of Jack's, Jim's and Dan's droves respectively.
We have:














\(\ds 2 \paren {a - 5}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b + 5\)





Said Jack to Jim: "If I give you six pigs for a horse then you will have twice as many animals in your drove as I will have in mine."














\(\ds 3 \paren {c - 13}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a + 13\)





Said Dan to Jack: "If I give you fourteen sheep for a horse, then you'll have three times as many animals as I have got."














\(\ds 6 \paren {b - 3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c + 3\)





Said Jim to Dan: "But if I give you four cows for a horse, then you'll have six times as many animals as I."




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 a - 15\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b\)





simplifying the above constraints




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 3 c - 52\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 6 b - 21\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 3 \paren {6 b - 21} - 52\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a\)





eliminating $c$ from $(2)$ and $(3)$




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 18 b - 115\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 18 \paren {2 a - 15} - 115\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a\)





eliminating $b$ from $(1)$ and $(4)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 35 a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 385\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 11\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times 11 - 15\)





substituting for $a$ in $(1)$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \times 7 - 21\)





substituting for $b$ in $(3)$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 21\)





simplifying

Theorem
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $A$ and $B$ be $k$-algebras.
Let $f: A \to B$ be a $k$-algebra homomorphism.
Let $B$ be finitely generated over $k$.
Let $\mathfrak m$ be a maximal ideal of $B$.

Then its preimage $\map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak m}$ is a maximal ideal of $A$.


Proof
We have an injective morphism:

$\dfrac A {\map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak m} } \to \dfrac B {\mathfrak m}$

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: The exact meaning of the above line needs to be defined.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
We have that $\dfrac B {\mathfrak m}$ is a field extension of $k$ which is finitely generated.
Thus, by Zariski's Lemma, $\dfrac B {\mathfrak m}$ is a finite field extension. 
By Subalgebra of Finite Field Extension is Field, $\dfrac A {\map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak m} }$ is a field.
Thus $\map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak m}$ is a maximal ideal.

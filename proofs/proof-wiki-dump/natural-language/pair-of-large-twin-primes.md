Theorem
The integers defined as:

$1\,159\,142\,985 \times 2^{2304} \pm 1$
are a pair of twin primes each with $703$ digits.


Proof
$1\,159\,142\,985 \times 2^{2304} - 1$:
It was checked that it is a prime number using the "Alpertron" Integer factorisation calculator on $6$th March $2022$.
This took approximately $0.2$ seconds.

$1\,159\,142\,985 \times 2^{2304} + 1$:
It was checked that it is a prime number using the "Alpertron" Integer factorisation calculator on $6$th March $2022$.
This took approximately $0.8$ seconds.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
David Wells reports in his Curious and Interesting Numbers of $1986$ that this pair of twin primes is the largest reported on by Richard K. Guy in his Unsolved Problems in Number Theory of $1981$.
It is reported that they were discovered by A.O.L. Atkin and N.W. Rickert in $1979$.

Apparently they also discovered the pair $694\,513\,810 \times 2^{2304} \pm 1$ at around the same time.

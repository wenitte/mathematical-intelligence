Theorem
Let $K$ be a field.
Let $\GL {n, K}$ be the general linear group of order $n$ over $K$.

Then $\GL {n, K}$ is a group.


Proof
Taking the group axioms in turn:


Group Axiom $\text G 0$: Closure
The matrix product of two $n \times n$ matrices is another $n \times n$ matrix.
The matrix product of two nonsingular matrices is another nonsingular matrix.
Thus $\GL {n, K}$ is closed.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 1$: Associativity
Matrix Multiplication is Associative.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 2$: Existence of Identity Element
From Unit Matrix is Unity of Ring of Square Matrices, the unit matrix serves as the identity of $\GL {n, K}$.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 3$: Existence of Inverse Element
From the definition of nonsingular matrix, the inverse of any nonsingular matrix $\mathbf A$ is $\mathbf A^{-1}$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral.
Then:

$ABCD$ is a parallelogram
if and only if:

$AB = CD$ and $AB \parallel CD$
where $AB \parallel CD$ denotes that $AB$ is parallel to $CD$.


Proof
Sufficient Condition
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram.
Then $AB \parallel CD$ by definition.
From Opposite Sides and Angles of Parallelogram are Equal it follows that $AB = CD$.
$\Box$


Necessary Condition
Let $AB = CD$ and $AB \parallel CD$.
Then from Lines Joining Equal and Parallel Straight Lines are Parallel, $AD \parallel BC$.
Thus we have $AB \parallel CD$ and $AD \parallel BC$, and so by definition $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let:

$\struct {S_1, \odot_1, \odot_2, \ldots, \odot_n}$
$\struct {S_2, *_1, *_2, \ldots, *_n}$
$\struct {S_3, \oplus_1, \oplus_2, \ldots, \oplus_n}$
be algebraic structures.
Let:

$\phi: \struct {S_1, \odot_1, \odot_2, \ldots, \odot_n} \to \struct {S_2, *_1, *_2, \ldots, *_n}$
$\psi: \struct {S_2, *_1, *_2, \ldots, *_n} \to \struct {S_3, \oplus_1, \oplus_2, \ldots, \oplus_n}$
be isomorphisms.
Then the composite of $\phi$ and $\psi$ is also an isomorphism.


Proof
If $\phi$ and $\psi$ are both isomorphisms, then they are by definition:

homomorphisms
bijections.
From Composite of Homomorphisms on Algebraic Structure is Homomorphism:

$\phi \circ \psi$ and $\psi \circ \phi$ are both homomorphisms.
From Composite of Bijections is Bijection:

$\phi \circ \psi$ and $\psi \circ \phi$ are both bijections.
Hence by definition both are also isomorphisms.

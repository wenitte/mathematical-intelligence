Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ and $\struct {H, \circ}$ be groups.
Let $\phi: G \to H$ and $\psi: G \to H$ be homomorphisms. 
Let $\gen S = G$ be the group generated by $S$.
Let:

$\forall x \in S: \map \phi x = \map \psi x$

Then:

$\phi = \psi$


Proof
Let $H = \set {x \in G: \map \phi x = \map \psi x}$.
From Elements of Group with Equal Images under Homomorphisms form Subgroup, $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.
But from the definition of the group generated by $S$, the smallest subgroup that contains $S$ is $G$ itself.
Thus:

$G = \set {x \in G: \map \phi x = \map \psi x}$
and so:

$\phi = \psi$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\map \Card S$ denote the cardinal of the set $S$.
Then $\map \Card S$ induces an equivalence class which contains all sets which have the same cardinality as $S$.


Proof
Follows directly from:

The definition of a cardinal as $S \sim T \iff \map \Card S = \map \Card T$
Set Equivalence behaves like Equivalence Relation
Relation Partitions Set iff Equivalence.
$\blacksquare$

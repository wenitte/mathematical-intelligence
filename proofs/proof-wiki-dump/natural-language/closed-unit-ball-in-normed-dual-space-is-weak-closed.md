Theorem
Let $X$ be a normed vector space. 
Let $X^\ast$ be the normed dual space of $X$. 
Let $B^-_{X^\ast}$ be the closed unit ball in $X^\ast$. 

Then we have that $B^-_{X^\ast}$ is weak-$\ast$ closed.


Proof
From Weak-* Topology is Hausdorff, $\struct {X^\ast, w^\ast}$ is Hausdorff.
From the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem, $\struct {B^-_{X^\ast}, w^\ast}$ is compact. 
From Compact Subspace of Hausdorff Space is Closed, it follows that $B^-_{X^\ast}$ is weak-$\ast$ closed.

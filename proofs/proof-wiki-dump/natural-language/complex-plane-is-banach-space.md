Theorem
The complex plane, along with the complex modulus, forms a Banach space over $\C$.


Proof
The complex plane $\C$ is a vector space over $\C$.
That the norm axioms are satisfied is proven in Complex Modulus is Norm.
Then we have Complex Plane is Complete Metric Space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

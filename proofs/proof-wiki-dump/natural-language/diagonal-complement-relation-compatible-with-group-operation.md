Theorem
Let $\left({G, \circ}\right)$ be a group.
Let $\Delta_G$ be the diagonal relation on $G$.

Then $\Delta_G^c = \complement_{G \times G} \Delta_G$ is a relation compatible with $\circ$.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Find another way to write the above, it's uglyYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
In other words, $\ne$ is a relation compatible with $\circ$.


Proof
By Diagonal Relation is Universally Compatible, $\Delta_G$ is compatible with $\circ$.
By Complement of Relation Compatible with Group is Compatible , $\Delta_G^c$ is also compatible with $\circ$.
$\blacksquare$

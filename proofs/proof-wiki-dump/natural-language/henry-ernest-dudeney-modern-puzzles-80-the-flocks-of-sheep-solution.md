Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $80$
The Flocks of Sheep
Four brothers were comparing the number of sheep that they owned.
It was found that Claude had ten more sheep than Dan.
If Claude gave a quarter of his sheep to Ben,
then Claude and Adam would together have the same number as Ben and Dan together.
If, then, Adam gave one-third to Ben,
and Ben gave a quarter of what he then held to Claude,
who then passed on a fifth of his holding to Dan,
and then Ben divided one-quarter of the number he then possessed equally among Adam, Claude and Dan,
they would all have an equal number of sheep.
How many sheep did each possess?


Solution
Adam had $60$ sheep.
Ben had $50$ sheep.
Claude had $40$ sheep.
Dan had $30$ sheep.


Proof
Let $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be the number of sheep owned by Adam, Ben, Claude and Dan respectively.
Let $B_1$ and $C_1$ be the number of sheep owned by Ben and Claude respectively after Claude gives Ben a quarter of his.
Let $B_2$ and $A_2$ be the number of sheep owned by Ben and Adam respectively after Adam gives Ben a third of his.
Let $B_3$ and $C_3$ be the number of sheep owned by Ben and Claude respectively after Ben gives Claude a quarter of his.
Let $C_4$ and $D_4$ be the number of sheep owned by Claude and Dan respectively after Claude gives Dan a fifth of his.
Let $A_5$, $B_5$, $C_5$ and $D_5$ be the number of sheep owned by Adam, Ben, Claude and Dan respectively at the end of the series of exchanges.
We have:

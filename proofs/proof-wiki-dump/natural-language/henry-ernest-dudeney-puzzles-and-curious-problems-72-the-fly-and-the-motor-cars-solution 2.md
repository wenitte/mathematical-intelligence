Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $72$
The Fly and the Motor-Cars
A road is $300$ miles long.
A motor-car, $A$, starts at noon from one end and goes throughout at $50$ miles an hour,
and at the same time another car, $B$, going uniformly at $100$ miles an hour, starts from the other end,
together with a fly travelling $150$ miles an hour.
When the fly meets the car $A$, it immediately turns and flies towards $B$.
$(1)$ When does the fly meet $B$?
The fly then turns towards $A$ and continues flying backwards and forwards between $A$ and $B$.
$(2)$ When will the fly be crushed between the two cars if they collide and it does not get out of the way?


Solution
$(1): \quad$ At $13:48$, at which point they are $120$ miles from $A$.
$(2): \quad$ At $14:00$, at which point they are $100$ miles from $A$.


Proof
Let $d_1$ miles from $A$ be the point at which the fly first meets $A$.
Let $d_2$ miles from $A$ be the point where $B$ is at that time.
Let $t_1$ hours after noon be the time at which this happens.

Let $d_3$ miles from $A$ be the point at which the fly then meets $B$.
Let $t_2$ hours after noon be the time at which this happens.

First we investigate where everybody is when the fly first meets $A$.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds d_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 50 t_1\)





A motor-car, $A$, starts at noon from one end and goes throughout at $50$ miles an hour,




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 300 - d_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100 t_1\)





and at the same time another car, $B$, going uniformly at $100$ miles an hour, starts from the other end,




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 300 - d_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 150 t_1\)





together with a fly travelling $150$ miles an hour.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 300\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {50 + 150} t_1\)





$(1) + (2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {300} {200}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 \tfrac 1 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 75\)





substituting for $t$ in $(1)$ and simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 300 - d_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100 \times \dfrac 3 2\)





substituting for $t$ in $d_2$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 300 - 150 = 150\)









So when the fly first meets $A$, they are $75$ miles from $A$, while $B$ is $150$ miles from $A$ (which also happens to be $150$ miles from $B$).
This happens at $1 \tfrac 1 2$ hours after noon 

Now we investigate when the fly first meets $B$.
At this stage we are not interested in what happens to $A$, just $B$ and the fly.
We have:




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 150 - d_3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100 \paren {t_2 - \dfrac 3 2}\)





... $B$, going uniformly at $100$ miles an hour ...




\(\text {(5)}: \quad\)









\(\ds d_3 - 75\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 150 \paren {t_2 - \dfrac 3 2}\)





... a fly travelling $150$ miles an hour ...








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 150 - 75\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {100 + 150} \paren {t_2 - \dfrac 3 2}\)





$(4) + (5)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 3 2 + \dfrac {75} {250}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 \tfrac 4 5\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d_3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 75 + 45 = 120\)





substituting for $t_2$ into $(5)$ and simplifying




So the fly meets $B$ at $120$ miles from $A$, which happens at $1 \tfrac 4 5$ hours after noon, or at $13:48$.
$\Box$

Let $d_4$ miles from $A$ be the point at which the cars collide.
Let this happen at $t_3$ hours after noon.
We have:




\(\text {(6)}: \quad\)









\(\ds d_4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 50 t_3\)





A motor-car, $A$, starts at noon from one end and goes throughout at $50$ miles an hour,




\(\text {(6)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 300 - d_4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100 t_3\)





and at the same time another car, $B$, going uniformly at $100$ miles an hour, starts from the other end








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 300\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {50 + 100} t_3\)





$(6) + (7)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t_3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d_4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)









Thus $A$ and $B$ collide at $2$ hours past noon, $100$ miles from $A$.
We do not need to calculate the path of the fly, despite the fact that the naïve reader may be tempted into trying.

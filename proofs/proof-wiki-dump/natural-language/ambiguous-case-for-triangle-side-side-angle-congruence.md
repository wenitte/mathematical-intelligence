Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
Let the sides $a, b, c$ of $\triangle ABC$ be opposite $A, B, C$ respectively.

Let the sides $a$ and $b$ be known.
Let the angle $\angle B$ also be known.
Then it may not be possible to know the value of $\angle A$.

This is known as the ambiguous case.


Proof 1
From the Law of Sines, we have:

$\dfrac {\sin a} {\sin A} = \dfrac {\sin b} {\sin B} = \dfrac {\sin c} {\sin C}$
from which:

$\sin A = \dfrac {\sin a \sin B} {\sin b}$
We find that $0 < \sin A \le 1$.
We have that:

$\sin A = \map \sin {\pi - A}$
and so unless $\sin A = 1$ and so $A = \dfrac \pi 2$, it is not possible to tell which of $A$ or $\pi - A$ provides the correct solution.



$\blacksquare$

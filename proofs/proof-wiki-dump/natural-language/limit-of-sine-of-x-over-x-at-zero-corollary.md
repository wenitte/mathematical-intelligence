Theorem
$\ds \lim_{x \mathop \to 0} \frac x {\sin x} = 1$


Proof
We have the inequality:

$1 \le \dfrac \theta {\sin \theta} \le \dfrac 1 {\cos \theta}$
for all $\theta \in \openint {-\dfrac \pi 2} 0 \cup \openint 0 {\dfrac \pi 2}$.

Taking the limit of the leftmost term and the rightmost term:

$\ds \lim_{\theta \mathop \to 0} \ 1 = 1$
$\ds \lim_{\theta \mathop \to 0} \frac 1 {\cos \theta} = 1$
So by the Squeeze Theorem:

$\ds \lim_{\theta \mathop \to 0} \frac \theta {\sin \theta} = 1$
$\blacksquare$

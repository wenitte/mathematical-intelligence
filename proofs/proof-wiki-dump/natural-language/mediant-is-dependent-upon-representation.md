Theorem
Let $r, s \in \Q$ be rational numbers.
Let $r$ and $s$ be expressed as:














\(\ds r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac a b\)




















\(\ds s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac c d\)









where $a, b, c, d$ are integers such that $b > 0, d > 0$.

Then the mediant of $r$ and $s$ is dependent upon the specific integers chosen for $a, b, c, d$.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample
Let $r = \dfrac 1 2$ and $s = 1$.
We have:

$r = \dfrac 1 2 = \dfrac 2 4 = \dfrac 3 6$
Then the mediant of $r = \dfrac 2 4$ and $s = \dfrac 1 1$ gives: 

$\dfrac {2 + 1} {4 + 1} = \dfrac 3 5$
but the mediant of $r = \dfrac 1 2$ and $s = \dfrac 1 1$ gives: 

$\dfrac {1 + 1} {2 + 1} = \dfrac 2 3$
which is not the same as $\dfrac {2 + 1} {4 + 1}$.
$\blacksquare$

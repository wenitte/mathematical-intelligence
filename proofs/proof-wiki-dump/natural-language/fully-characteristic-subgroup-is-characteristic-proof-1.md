Theorem
Let $G$ a group.
Let $H$ a fully characteristic subgroup of $G$.
Then $H$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$.


Proof
By definition of a fully characteristic subgroup,
$H$ is invariant under every group endomorphism of $G$.
By Group Automorphism is Endomorphism, every group automorphism is a group endomorphism.
Hence, invariance over every group endomorphism implies invariance over every group automorphism.
And by definition of a characteristic subgroup,
$H$ is characteristic.

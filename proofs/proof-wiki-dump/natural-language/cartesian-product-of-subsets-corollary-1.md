Corollary to Cartesian Product of Subsets
Let $A, B, S$ be sets such that $A \subseteq B$.

Then:

$A \times S \subseteq B \times S$


Proof
From Set is Subset of Itself we have $S \subseteq S$.
From Cartesian Product of Subsets:

$A \subseteq B \land S \subseteq S \implies A \times S \subseteq B \times S$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\mathbf C$ be a metacategory.
Suppose $\mathbf C$ admits a product $\prod \O$ for the empty set.

Then $\prod \O$ is a terminal object of $\mathbf C$.


Proof
By definition, $\prod \O$ is the limit of the empty subcategory $\mathbf 0$ of $\mathbf C$.
The result follows from Terminal Object as Limit.

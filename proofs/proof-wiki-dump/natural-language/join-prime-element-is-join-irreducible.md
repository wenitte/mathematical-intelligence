Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \vee, \preceq}$ be a join semilattice.
Let $z \in S$ be a join-prime element.

Then:

$z$ is join-irreducible


Proof
By Dual Pairs (Order Theory):

join semilattice is dual to meet semilattice.
join prime element is dual to meet prime element.
join irreducible element is dual to meet irreducible element.
Thus the theorem holds by the duality principle applied to Characterization of Meet Irreducible Element.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$p, \neg p \vdash \bot$


Proof
We apply the Method of Truth Tables.
$\begin{array}{|cccc||c|} \hline
p & \land & \neg & p & \bot \\
\hline
F & F & T & F & F \\
T & F & F & T & F \\
\hline
\end{array}$
As can be seen by inspection, the truth value of the main connective, that is $\land$, is $F$ for each boolean interpretation for $p$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $m$ and $n$ be ordinals.

Then it is not the case that $m \in n$ and $n \in m$.


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $m \in n$ and $n \in m$.
Since $m$ is an ordinal, it is transitive.
Thus since $m \in n$ and $n \in m$, it follows that $m \in m$.
But this contradicts Ordinal is not Element of Itself.
$\blacksquare$

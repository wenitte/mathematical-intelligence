Theorem
Let $X$ be a random variable on some probability space with mean $\mu$. 
Then the first central moment $\mu_1$ of $X$ is equal to $0$.


Proof













\(\ds \mu_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \expect {X - \mu}\)





Definition of Central Moment














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \expect X - \mu\)





Expectation is Linear














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \mu - \mu\)





$\expect X = \mu$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)









$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The area $A$ of a circle is given by:

$A = \pi r^2$
where $r$ is the radius of the circle.


Proof
From Equation of Circle:

$x^2 + y^2 = r^2$

Let $A$ be the area of the circle whose equation is given by $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.
We have that:

$y = \pm \sqrt {r^2 - x^2}$
For the upper half of the circle:

$y = +\sqrt {r^2 - x^2}$
Thus for the right hand half of the upper half of the circle:














\(\ds \frac A 4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \int_0^r \sqrt {r^2 - x^2} \rd x\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\pi r^2} 4\)





Definite Integral from $0$ to $r$ of $\sqrt {r^2 - x^2}$



Hence the result.

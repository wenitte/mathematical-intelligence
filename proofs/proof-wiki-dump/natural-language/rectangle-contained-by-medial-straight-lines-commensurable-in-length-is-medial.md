Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

The rectangle contained by medial straight lines commensurable in length is medial.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $24$)


Proof
Let $x$ and $\lambda x$ be two medials such that:

$x \frown \lambda x$
where $\frown$ denotes that $x$ and $\lambda x$ are commensurable in length.
By Areas of Triangles and Parallelograms Proportional to Base:

$x^2 : x \cdot \lambda x = x : \lambda x$
From Commensurability of Elements of Proportional Magnitudes: 

$x^2 \frown x \cdot \lambda x$
From Medial is Irrational we have that $x^2$ is medial.
Therefore by Straight Line Commensurable with Medial Straight Line is Medial: Porism:

$x \cdot \lambda x$ is medial.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $24$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

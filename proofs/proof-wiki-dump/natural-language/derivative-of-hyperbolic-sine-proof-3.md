Theorem
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sinh x} = \cosh x$


Proof

The validity of the material on this page is questionable.In particular: The link to Derivative of Sine Function demonstrates the result in the real domain only.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by resolving the issues.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Questionable}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a right triangle with $c$ as the hypotenuse.
Then:

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$


Proof

The two squares both have the same area, that is, $\paren {a + b}^2$.
The one on the left has four triangles of area $\dfrac {a b} 2$ and a square of area $c^2$.
The one on the right has four triangles of area $\dfrac {a b} 2$ and two squares: one of area $a^2$ and one of area $b^2$.
Take away the triangles from both of the big squares and you are left with $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.
$\blacksquare$


Source of Name
This entry was named for Pythagoras of Samos.


Historical Note
This proof is the basis of the Aldous Huxley short story Young Archimedes.

Theorem
Let $\struct {\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr}$ be a probability space. 
Let $X$ be a real-valued random variable. 

Then $\size X$ is a real-valued random variable.


Proof
Since $X$ is a real-valued random variable, $X$ is $\Sigma$-measurable.
From Absolute Value of Measurable Function is Measurable, $\size X$ is $\Sigma$-measurable.
So $\size X$ is a real-valued random variable.
$\blacksquare$

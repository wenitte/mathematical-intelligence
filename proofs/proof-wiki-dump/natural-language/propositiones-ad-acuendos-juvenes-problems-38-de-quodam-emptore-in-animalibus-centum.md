Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $38$
De Quodam Emptore in Animalibus Centum
A Man Buying a Hundred Animals
A man wanted to buy $100$ assorted animals for $100$ shillings.
He was willing to pay $3$ shillings for a horse,
$1$ shilling for an ox,
and $1$ shilling for $24$ sheep.
How many horses, oxen and sheep did he buy?


Solution
$23$ horses, $29$ oxen and $48$ sheep.


Proof
Let $h$, $o$ and $s$ denote the number of horses, oxen and sheep respectively.
We have:














\(\ds 3 h + o + \dfrac s {24}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





the amount spent




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 72 h + 24 o + s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2400\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds h + o + s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





the total number of animals








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 71 h + 23 o\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2300\)





$(1) - (2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2300 - 71 h\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 23 o\)









Note that both $h$ and $o$ need to be (strictly) positive.
We need to find possible values of $h$ such that $2300 - 71 h$ is divisible by $23$.
This can happen only when $h$ itself is divisible by $23$.










\(\ds h = 0: \, \)



\(\ds 2300 - 71 \times 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2300\)

\(\ds = 23 \times 100\)














\(\ds h = 23: \, \)



\(\ds 2300 - 71 \times 23\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 667\)

\(\ds = 23 \times 29\)








It is implicit that there are at least some horses are bought, so the solution:

$h = 0, o = 100, s = 0$
is usually ruled out.
Hence we have:

$h = 23, o = 29, s = 48$
$\blacksquare$

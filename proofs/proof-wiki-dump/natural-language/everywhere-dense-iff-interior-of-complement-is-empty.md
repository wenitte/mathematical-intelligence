Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $A \subset S$.
Then $A$ is everywhere dense if and only if:

$\paren {\relcomp S A}^\circ = \O$

where $A^\circ$ is the interior of $A$.


Proof
By definition of everywhere dense, $A$ is everywhere dense if and only if:

$A^- = S$
where $A^-$ is the closure of $A$.

That happens if and only if:














\(\ds \paren {\relcomp S A}^\circ\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \relcomp S {A^-}\)





Complement of Interior equals Closure of Complement














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \relcomp S S\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \O\)





Relative Complement with Self is Empty Set



Hence the result.

Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
Open me and I, a spout with abundant flow, will fill the present cistern in four hours;
the one on my right requires four more hours to fill it,
and the third twice as much.
But if you bid them both join me in pouring forth a stream of water, we will fill it in a small part of the day.


Solution
Let $t$ be the number of hours it takes to fill the cistern.
Let $a, b, c$ be the flow rate in numbers of cisterns per hour of (respectively) the first, second and third spouts.

In $t$ hours, the various contributions of each of the spouts is $a t$, $b t$ and $c t$ respectively.
So for the total contribution to be $1$ cistern, we have:















\(\ds \paren {a + b + c} t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {a + b + c}\)










We have:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 4\)





that is, $1$ cistern in $4$ hours














\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 8\)





that is, $1$ cistern in $4 + 4$ hours














\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {16}\)





that is, $1$ cistern in $2 \times {\paren 4 + 4}$ hours




and so:














\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {a + b + c}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {\dfrac 1 4 + \dfrac 1 8 + \dfrac 1 {16} }\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {16} {4 + 2 + 1}\)





multiplying top and bottom by $16$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {16} 7\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \frac 2 7\)









So the cistern will be filled in $2 \frac 2 7$ hours.

Historical Note
In W.R. Paton's $1918$ translation of The Greek Anthology Book XIV, he gives the answer as $2 \frac 2 {11}$ hours.
The discrepancy between this and the $2 \frac 2 7$ reported in the calculation is explained by the imprecision of the wording of the epigram.

If we take:

the third twice as much
to mean:

the third spout takes twice as much time to fill a cistern as the second spout
then we deduce that the third spout takes $16$ hours (that is, twice four plus four hours) to fill the cistern.
Hence we arrive at the solution $2 \frac 2 7$ hours.

However, if we interpret:

the third twice as much
to mean:

the third spout takes twice as much longer (that is, eight hours) than the first spout than the second one does to fill a cistern
that would mean the third spout takes $4$ hours plus twice $4$ hours, that is $12$ hours, to fill a cistern.

If this assumption is made, then $2 \frac 2 {11}$ is correct.

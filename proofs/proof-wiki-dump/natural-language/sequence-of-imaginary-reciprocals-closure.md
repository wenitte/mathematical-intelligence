Theorem
Consider the subset $S$ of the complex plane defined as:

$S := \set {\dfrac i n : n \in \Z_{>0} }$
That is:

$S := \set {i, \dfrac i 2, \dfrac i 3, \dfrac i 4, \ldots}$
where $i$ is the imaginary unit.

The closure of $S$ is the set:

$\set {0, i, \dfrac i 2, \dfrac i 3, \dfrac i 3, \ldots}$


Proof
By definition, the closure of $S$ is the set $S$ along with all its limit points.
Sequence of Imaginary Reciprocals: Limit Points, $S$ has one limit point $z = 0$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

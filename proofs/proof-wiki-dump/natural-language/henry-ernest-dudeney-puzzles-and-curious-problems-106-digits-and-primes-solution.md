Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $106$
Digits and Primes
Using the $9$ digits once, and once only,
can you find prime numbers that will add up to the smallest total possible?


Solution
The solution given by Dudeney is:

   8 9
   6 1
   4 7
     5
     3
+    2
 -----
 2 0 7

but we also have:

   8 9
   6 7
   4 1
     5
     3
+    2
 -----
 2 0 7

Proof
From the start we make the assumption that we can do this using primes less than $100$.
We have that $4$, $6$ and $8$ must appear in the tens column.
Hence we must use one element of each of the following sets:

$\set {41, 43, 47}$
$\set {61, 67}$
$\set {83, 89}$
By inspection we can see that $41$, $67$ and $89$ use up $6$ digits each, while the remaining digits are primes on their own.
There can be no sum lower than this.
We also note that $41 + 67 = 47 + 61$, giving a second solution.

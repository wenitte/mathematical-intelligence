Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group.
Let $\struct {\powerset G, \circ_\PP}$ be the power structure of $\struct {G, \circ}$.

Then $\struct {\powerset G, \circ_\PP}$ is a semigroup.


Proof
By definition a group is also a semigroup.
The result then follows from Power Structure of Semigroup is Semigroup.

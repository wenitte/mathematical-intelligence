Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $84$
Find the Cube
A number increased by its cube is $592 \, 788$.
What is that number?


Solution
$84$


Proof
We are looking for $n$ such that:

$n^3 + n = 592 \, 788$
First we see that $\sqrt [3] {592 \, 788}$ is approximately $84 \cdotp 00...$
We calculate $84^3$ and get:

$84^3 = 592 \, 704$
and see that:

$84 + 592 \, 704 = 592 \, 788$
and our task is complete.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $D$ be a deck of $62$ cards.
Let $D$ be given a sequence of modified perfect faro shuffles.
Then after $6$ such shuffles, the cards of $D$ will be in the same order they started in.


Proof
From Number of Modified Perfect Faro Shuffles to return Deck of Cards to Original Order, the cards of $D$ will return to their original order after $n$ such shuffles, where:

$2^n \equiv 1 \pmod {63}$
We have that:

$63 = 2^6 - 1$
and so:

$2^6 \equiv 1 \pmod {63}$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

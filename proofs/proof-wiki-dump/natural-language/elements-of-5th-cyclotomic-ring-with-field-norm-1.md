Theorem
Let $\struct {\Z \sqbrk {i \sqrt 5}, +, \times}$ denote the $5$th cyclotomic ring.

The only elements of $\struct {\Z \sqbrk {i \sqrt 5}, +, \times}$ whose field norm equals $1$ are the units of $\struct {\Z \sqbrk {i \sqrt 5}, +, \times}$: $1$ and $-1$.


Proof
From Units of 5th Cyclotomic Ring, $1$ and $-1$ are the only units of $\struct {\Z \sqbrk {i \sqrt 5}, +, \times}$.

Let $\map N z$ denote the field norm of $z \in \Z \sqbrk {i \sqrt 5}$.
Let $z \in \Z \sqbrk {i \sqrt 5}$ such that $\map N z = 1$.

Let $z = x + i y$.
Then:














\(\ds \map N z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)





Field Norm on 5th Cyclotomic Ring








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 + 5 y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)


















\(\, \ds \land \, \)

\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)









The result follows.

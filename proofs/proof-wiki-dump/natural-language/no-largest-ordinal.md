Theorem
Let $a$ be a set of ordinals.
Then:

$\forall x \in a: x \prec \paren {\bigcup a}^+$


Proof
For this proof, we shall use $\prec$, $\in$, and $\subset$ interchangeably.
We are justified in doing this because of Ordering on Ordinal is Subset Relation and Transitive Set is Proper Subset of Ordinal iff Element of Ordinal.

Remark

This page has been identified as a candidate for refactoring of basic complexity.In particular: If this is "another means of proving the Burali-Forti Paradox", this needs to be proved therein rather than discussed here.Until this has been finished, please leave {{Refactor}} in the code.
New contributors: Refactoring is a task which is expected to be undertaken by experienced editors only.

Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.
This theorem allows us to create an ordinal strictly greater than any ordinal in the set.  Thus, this is another means of proving the Burali-Forti Paradox.  If the ordinals are a set, then we may construct an ordinal greater than the set of all ordinals, a contradiction.

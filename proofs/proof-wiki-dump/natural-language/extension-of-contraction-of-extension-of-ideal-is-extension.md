Theorem
Let $A$ and $B$ be commutative rings with unity.
Let $fÂ : A \to B$ be a ring homomorphism.
Let $\mathfrak a$ be an ideal of $A$.
Let ${\mathfrak a}^e$ be the extension of $\mathfrak a$ by $f$.
Let ${\mathfrak a}^{ec}$ be the contraction of ${\mathfrak a}^e$ by $f$.
Let ${\mathfrak a}^{ece}$ be the extension of ${\mathfrak a}^{ec}$ by $f$.

Then:

${\mathfrak a}^e = {\mathfrak a}^{ece}$


Proof
Since $\mathfrak a \subseteq {\mathfrak a}^{ec}$ by Ideal is Contained in Contraction of Extension:














\(\ds {\mathfrak a}^e\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds \paren { {\mathfrak a}^{ec} }^e\)





Extension of Ideals Preserves Inclusion Order














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds {\mathfrak a}^{ece}\)





Composition of Mappings is Associative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren { {\mathfrak a}^e }^{ce}\)





Composition of Mappings is Associative














\(\ds \)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds {\mathfrak a}^e\)





Ideal Contains Extension of Contraction

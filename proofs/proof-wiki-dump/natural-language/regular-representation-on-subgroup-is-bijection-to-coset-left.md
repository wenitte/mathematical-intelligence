Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.
Let $x, y \in G$.

Let $y H$ denote the left coset of $H$ by $y$.

The mapping $\lambda_x: H \to x H$, where $\lambda_x$ is the left regular representation of $H$ with respect to $x$, is a bijection from $H$ to $x H$.


Proof
Let $h \in H$.
Then:

$\map {\lambda_x} h = x h \in x H$
Thus:

$\forall h \in H: \map {\lambda_x} h \in x H$
demonstrating that $\lambda_x: H \to x H$ is a mapping.
A permutation is a bijection by definition.
As Regular Representations in Group are Permutations, it follows that $\lambda_x$ is a bijection.

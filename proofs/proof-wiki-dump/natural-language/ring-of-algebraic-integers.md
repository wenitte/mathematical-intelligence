Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.
Theorem
Let $K / \Q$ be a number field.
Let $\Z \sqbrk x$ denote the polynomial ring in one variable over $\Z$.
Let $\OO_K$ denote the set of all elements of $K / \Q$ which are a root of some monic polynomial $P \in \Z \sqbrk x$.
That is, let $\OO_K$ denote the algebraic integers over $K$.

Then $\OO_K$ is a ring, called the Ring of Algebraic Integers.


Proof
This is a special case of Integral Closure is Subring.
We have an extension of commutative rings with unity, $\Z \subseteq K$, and $\OO_K$ is the integral closure of $\Z$ in $K$.
The theorem says that $\OO_K$ is a subring of $K$.

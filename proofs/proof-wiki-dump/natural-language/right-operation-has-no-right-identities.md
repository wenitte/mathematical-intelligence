Theorem
Let $S$ be a set with more than $1$ element.
Let $\struct {S, \to}$ be an algebraic structure in which the operation $\to$ is the right operation.

Then $\struct {S, \to}$ has no right identities.


Proof
From Element under Right Operation is Left Identity, every element of $\struct {S, \to}$ is a left identity.
Because there are at least $2$ elements in $\struct {S, \to}$, it follows that $\struct {S, \to}$ has more than one left identity.
From More than one Left Identity then no Right Identity, it follows that $\struct {S, \to}$ has no right identity.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ denote the Arens-Fort space.

Then $T$ is zero dimensional.


Proof
Let $q \in S$ such that $q \ne \tuple {0, 0}$.
Then from Clopen Points in Arens-Fort Space, $\set q$ is clopen.
So $\forall q \in S, q \ne \tuple {0, 0}: \set {\set q}$ is a local basis for $q$.

If we take the neighborhoods of $\tuple {0, 0}$ that are open we get that they are also closed from Neighborhood of Origin of Arens-Fort Space is Closed.
The union of the local basis forms a basis for the topology.
This basis is formed with clopen sets.
So, by definition, $T$ is a zero dimensional space.

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $152$
The Length of a Lease
A friend's property had a $99$ years' lease.
When I asked him how much of this had expired, the reply was as follows:
Two-thirds of the time past was equal to four-fifths of the time to come,
so I had to work it out for myself.


Solution
$54$ years have elapsed, leaving $45$ years to go.


Proof
Let $t$ be the time elapsed on this lease.
We have:














\(\ds \dfrac 2 3 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 4 5 \paren {99 - t}\)





Two-thirds of the time past was equal to four-fifths of the time to come








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 10 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12 \paren {99 - t}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 12 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1188\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 54\)









and we see that:

$\dfrac 2 3 54 = 36 = \dfrac 4 5 45$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The system of axiomatic set theory that is Frege set theory is inconsistent.


Proof
From Russell's Paradox, the Axiom of Abstraction leads to a contradiction.
Let $q$ be such a contradiction:

$q = p \land \neg p$
for some statement $p$.
From the Rule of Explosion it then follows that every logical formula is a provable consequence of $q$.
Hence the result, by definition of inconsistent.
$\blacksquare$

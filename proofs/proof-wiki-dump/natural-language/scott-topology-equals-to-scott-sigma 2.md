Theorem
Let $\struct {T, \preceq, \tau}$ be a up-complete topological lattice with Scott topology.

Then $\tau = \map \sigma {T, \preceq}$
where $\map \sigma L$ denotes the Scott sigma of $L$.


Proof
This follows by Open iff Upper and with Property (S) in Scott Topological Lattice and definition Scott sigma.
$\blacksquare$

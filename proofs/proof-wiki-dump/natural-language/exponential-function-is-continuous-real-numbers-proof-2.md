Theorem
The real exponential function is continuous.
That is:

$\forall x_0 \in \R: \ds \lim_{x \mathop \to x_0} \exp x = \exp x_0$


Proof
This proof depends on the definition of the exponential function as the function inverse of the natural logarithm.

From Logarithm is Strictly Increasing, $\ln$ is strictly monotone on $\R_{>0}$.
From Real Natural Logarithm Function is Continuous, $\ln$ is continuous on $\R_{>0}$

Thus, from the Continuous Inverse Theorem, $\expÂ := \ln^{-1}$ is continuous.

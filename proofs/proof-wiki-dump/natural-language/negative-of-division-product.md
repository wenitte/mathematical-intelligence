Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $\struct {U_R, \circ}$ be the group of units of $\struct {R, +, \circ}$.

Then:

$\forall x \in R: -\dfrac x z = \dfrac {-x} z = \dfrac x {-z}$
where $\dfrac x z$ is defined as $x \circ \paren {z^{-1} }$, that is the division product of $x$ by $z$.


Proof
Follows directly from Product of Negative with Product Inverse and the definition of division product.
$\blacksquare$

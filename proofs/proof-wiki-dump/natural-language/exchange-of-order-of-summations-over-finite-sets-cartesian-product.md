Theorem
Let $\mathbb A$ be one of the standard number systems $\N, \Z, \Q, \R, \C$.
Let $S, T$ be finite sets.
Let $S \times T$ be their cartesian product.
Let $f: S \times T \to \mathbb A$ be a mapping.

Then we have an equality of summations over finite sets:

$\ds \sum_{s \mathop \in S} \sum_{t \mathop \in T} \map f {s, t} = \sum_{t \mathop \in T} \sum_{s \mathop \in S} \map f {s, t}$

Proof 2
Let $m$ be the cardinality of $S$ and $n$ be the cardinality of $T$.
Let $\N_{< m}$ denote an initial segment of the natural numbers.
Let $\sigma: \N_{< m} \to S$ and $\tauÂ : \N_{< n} \to T$ be bijections.
We have:

Proof 3
Let $n$ be the cardinality of $T$.
The proof goes by induction on $n$.


Basis for the Induction
Let $n = 0$.

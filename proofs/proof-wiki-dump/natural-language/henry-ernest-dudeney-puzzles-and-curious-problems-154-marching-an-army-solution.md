Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $154$
Marching an Army
A body of soldiers was marching in regular column, with $5$ men more in depth than in front.
When the enemy came in sight the front was increased by $845$ men,
and the whole was drawn up in $5$ lines.
How many men were there in all?


Solution
There were $4550$ men in the army.


Proof
Let $m$ be the total number of men.
Let $n$ be the number of men in front while marching.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n \paren {n + 5}\)





$5$ men more in depth than in front




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 \paren {n + 845}\)





the front was increased by $845$ men ... in $5$ lines.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n \paren {n + 5}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 \paren {n + 845}\)





eliminating $m$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4225\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 65\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 65 \times 70 = 4550\)









$\blacksquare$

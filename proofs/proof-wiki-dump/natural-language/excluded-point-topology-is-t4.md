Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_{\bar p} }$ be an excluded point space.

Then $T$ is a $T_4$ space.


Proof 1
We have that an Excluded Point Space is Ultraconnected.
That means none of its closed sets are disjount.
Hence, vacuously, any two of its disjoint closed subsets of $S$ are separated by neighborhoods.
The result follows by definition of $T_4$ space.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
We have:

Excluded Point Topology is Open Extension Topology of Discrete Topology
Open Extension Topology is $T_4$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 3
We have:

Excluded Point Topology is $T_5$
$T_5$ Space is $T_4$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem


Let $A$ and $C$ be arbitrary points on a circle in the plane.
Let $M$ be a point on the circle with arc $AM = $ arc $MC$.
Let $B$ lie on the minor arc of $AM$.
Draw chords $AB$ and $BC$.
Find $D$ such that $MD \perp BC$.
Then:

$AB + BD = DC$


Proof

Let $E$ be a point such that $BD = DE$.
Given:

arc $AM = $ arc $MC$
By Equal Arcs of Circles Subtended by Equal Straight Lines:

$AM = MC$
By Angles on Equal Arcs are Equal:

$\angle BAM = \angle MCB$
$BM$ is shared
We have Ambiguous Case for Triangle Side-Side-Angle Congruence for these three triangles:

$\triangle BAM$
$\triangle MBC$
$\triangle MEC$
Given:

$\angle MDC$ is a right angle
By External Angle of Triangle is Greater than Internal Opposite:

$\angle MEC$ is obtuse.
Since $AM = MC$ and $AC$ is the rest of the circumference:

the major arc of $AM$ is more than half the circle.
It follows that $\angle ABM$ is obtuse.

Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
Let fall a tear as you pass by; for we are those guests of Antiochus whom his house slew when it fell, and God gave us in equal shares this place for a banquet and a tomb.
Four of us from Tegea lie here,
twelve from Messene,
five from Argos,
and half of the banqueters were from Sparta,
and Antiochus himself.
A fifth of the fifth part of those who perished were from Athens,
and do thou, Corinth, weep for Hylas alone.


Solution
Let $n$ be the number of guests who were killed in the accident.

$4$ came from Tegea
$12$ came from Messene
$5$ came from Argos
$\dfrac n 2$ came from Sparta
$1$ was Antiochus
$\dfrac n {5 \times 5}$ came from Athens
$1$ (that is, Hylas) came from Corinth.

We have:














\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 + 12 + 5 + \dfrac n 2 + 1 + \dfrac n {25} + 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 50 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25 n + 2 n + 50 \times 23\)





multiplying through by $50 = \lcm \set {2, 25}$ and simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {50 - 25 - 2} n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 50 \times 23\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 23 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 50 \times 23\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 50\)










So there were $50$ guests.

$25$ came from Sparta
$2$ came from Athens
and the numbers of the remainder are specified explicitly.

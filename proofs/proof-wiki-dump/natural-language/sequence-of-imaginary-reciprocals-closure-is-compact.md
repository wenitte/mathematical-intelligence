Theorem
Consider the subset $S$ of the complex plane defined as:

$S := \set {\dfrac i n : n \in \Z_{>0} }$
That is:

$S := \set {i, \dfrac i 2, \dfrac i 3, \dfrac i 4, \ldots}$
where $i$ is the imaginary unit.

The closure $S^-$ of the set $S$ is compact.


Proof
From Topological Closure is Closed, $S^-$ is closed.
From Sequence of Imaginary Reciprocals: Boundedness, $S$ is bounded in $\C$.
It follows trivially that $S^-$ is also bounded in $\C$.

Hence the result by definition of compact.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {A, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a Banach algebra over $\C$. 
Let $\phiÂ : A \to \C$ be a character on $A$. 

Then $\phi$ is surjective.


Proof
As $\phi$ is non-zero, there exists an $x_0 \in A$ such that:

$\map \phi {x_0} \in \C \setminus \set 0$
Thus, for each $a \in \C$:














\(\ds \frac a {\map \phi {x_0} } x_0\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds A\)





as $A$ is a $\C$-algebra



and:














\(\ds \map \phi {\frac a {\map \phi {x_0} } x_0}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac a {\map \phi {x_0} } \map \phi {x_0}\)





as $\phi$ is a $\C$-algebra homomorphism














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a\)









$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a discrete topological space.
Let $A \subseteq S$.

Then:

$\partial A = \O$
where:

$\partial A$ is the boundary of $A$ in $T$.


Proof
Let $A \subseteq S$.
Then from Set in Discrete Topology is Clopen it follows that $A$ is both open and closed in $T$.
The result follows from Set Clopen iff Boundary is Empty.
$\blacksquare$

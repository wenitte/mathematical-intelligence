Theorem
Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. 
Let $fÂ : X \to \C$ be a function vanishing in a neighborhood of infinity. 

Then $f$ vanishes at infinity.


Proof
Let $\epsilon > 0$. 
Since $f$ vanishes in a neighborhood of infinity, there exists a compact $F \subseteq X$ such that:

$\map f x = 0$ for $x \in X \setminus F$
In particular:

$\cmod {\map f x} = 0 < \epsilon$ for each $x \in X \setminus F$.
Hence $f$ vanishes at infinity.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $x$ and $y$ be ordinals.
Let $y^+$ denote the successor of $y$.

Then:

$x \subseteq y^+ \iff \left({x \subseteq y \lor x = y^+}\right)$


Proof
Let $A \subset B$ denote that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$.
Let $A \in B$ denote that $A$ is an element of $B$.

From Transitive Set is Proper Subset of Ordinal iff Element of Ordinal, $\subset$ and $\in$ can be used interchangeably.
Thus:














\(\ds x \subseteq y\)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds x \subseteq y^+\)





Ordinal is Less than Successor














\(\ds x = y^+\)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds x \subseteq y^+\)





DefinitionÂ 2 of Set Equality



Conversely:














\(\ds x \subseteq y^+\)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds \paren {x \subset y^+ \lor x = y^+}\)




















\(\ds x \subset y^+\)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds x \in y^+\)





Transitive Set is Proper Subset of Ordinal iff Element of Ordinal














\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds \paren {x = y \lor x \in y}\)





Definition of Successor Set














\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds x \subseteq y\)





Transitive Set is Proper Subset of Ordinal iff Element of Ordinal

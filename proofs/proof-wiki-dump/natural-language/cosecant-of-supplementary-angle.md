Theorem
$\map \csc {\pi - \theta} = \csc \theta$
where $\csc$ denotes cosecant.

That is, the cosecant of an angle equals its supplement.


Proof













\(\ds \map \csc {\pi - \theta}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {\map \sin {\pi - \theta} }\)





Cosecant is Reciprocal of Sine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {\sin \theta}\)





Sine of Supplementary Angle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \csc \theta\)





Cosecant is Reciprocal of Sine



$\blacksquare$


Examples
Cosecant of $4 \theta - 180 \degrees$
$\map \csc {4 \theta - 180 \degrees} = -\map \csc {4 \theta}$

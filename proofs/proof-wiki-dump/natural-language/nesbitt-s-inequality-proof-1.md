Theorem
Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be (strictly) positive real numbers.
Then:

$\dfrac a {b + c} + \dfrac b {a + c} + \dfrac c {a + b} \ge \dfrac 3 2$


Proof













\(\ds \frac a {b + c} + \frac b {a + c} + \frac c {a + b}\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds \dfrac 3 2\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac {a + b + c} {b + c} + \frac {a + b + c} {a + c} + \frac {a + b + c} {a + b}\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds \frac 9 2\)





by adding $3$








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac {a + b + c} {b + c} + \frac {a + b + c} {a + c} + \frac {a + b + c} {a + b}\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds \frac {9 \paren {a + b + c} } {\paren {b + c} + \paren {a + c} + \paren {a + b} }\)





as $\dfrac {a + b + c} {\paren {b + c} + \paren {a + c} + \paren {a + b} } = \dfrac 1 2$








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac {\frac 1 {b + c} + \frac 1 {a + c} + \frac 1 {a + b} } 3\)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds \frac 3 {\paren {b + c} + \paren {a + c} + \paren {a + b} }\)





dividing by $3 \paren {a + b + c}$



These are the arithmetic mean and the harmonic mean of $\dfrac 1 {b + c}$, $\dfrac 1 {a + c}$ and $\dfrac 1 {a + b}$.
From AM-HM Inequality the last inequality is true.
Thus Nesbitt's Inequality holds.
$\blacksquare$

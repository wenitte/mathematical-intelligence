Theorem
Let $\C$ be the complex plane.
Let $H$ be a hyperbola in $\C$ whose major axis is $d \in \R_{>0}$ and whose foci are at $\alpha, \beta \in \C$.

Then $C$ may be written as:

$\cmod {z - \alpha} - \cmod {z - \beta} = d$
where $\cmod {\, \cdot \,}$ denotes complex modulus.


Proof
By definition of complex modulus:

$\cmod {z - \alpha}$ is the distance from $z$ to $\alpha$
$\cmod {z - \beta}$ is the distance from $z$ to $\beta$.
Thus $\cmod {z - \alpha} - \cmod {z - \beta}$ is the difference of the distance from $z$ to $\alpha$ and from $z$ to $\beta$.
This is precisely the equidistance property of the hyperbola.
From Equidistance of Hyperbola equals Transverse Axis, the constant distance $d$ is equal to the transverse axis of $H$.

Examples
Example: Foci at $3$ and $-3$, Transverse Axis $4$
The hyperbola in the complex plane whose transverse axis is of length $4$ and whose foci are at the points corresponding to $-3$ and $3$ is given by the equation:

$\cmod {z + 3} - \cmod {z - 3} = 4$

The equation:

$\map \Im {z^2} = 4$

Example of Problem from Chiu Chang Suann Jing
There is a pool $10$ feet square, with a reed growing vertically in the centre,
its roots at the bottom of the pool, which rises $1$ foot above the surface;
when drawn towards the shore it reaches exactly to the brink of the pool;
what is the depth of the water?


Solution
The water is $12$ feet deep.


Proof
Let the depth of the water be $d$.
The length of the reed is $d + 1$.
When drawn to the edge of the pool, the reed forms the hypotenuse  of a right triangle.
One of the legs of that right triangle is the depth of the pool, which is $d$.
The other leg is the distance from the centre of the pool, which is $5$ feet.
Hence:














\(\ds \paren {d + 1}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds d^2 + 5^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 d + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25\)





simplification








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)





simplification




The right triangle in question here is the $\text{5-12-13}$ triangle.
$\blacksquare$

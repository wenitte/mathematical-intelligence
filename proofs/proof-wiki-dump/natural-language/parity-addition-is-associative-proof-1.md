Theorem
Let $RÂ := \struct {\set {\text{even}, \text{odd} }, +, \times}$ be the parity ring.

The operation $+$ is associative:

$\forall a, b, c \in R: \paren {a + b} + c = a + \paren {b + c}$


Proof
From Isomorphism between Ring of Integers Modulo 2 and Parity Ring:

$\struct {\set {\text {even}, \text {odd} }, +, \times}$ is isomorphic with $\struct {\Z_2, +_2, \times_2}$
the ring of integers modulo $2$.

The result follows from:

Modulo Addition is Associative
and:

Isomorphism Preserves Associativity.

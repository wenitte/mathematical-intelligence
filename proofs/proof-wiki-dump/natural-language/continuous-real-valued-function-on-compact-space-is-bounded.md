Theorem
Let $\struct {K, \tau}$ be a compact space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $f: S \to \R$ be a continuous real-valued function.

Then:

$f$ is bounded.


Proof
From Compact Space is Pseudocompact:

$\struct {K, \tau}$ is pseudocompact
By definition of pseudocompact:

$f$ is bounded.
$\blacksquare$

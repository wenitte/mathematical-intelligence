Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.

Then there is no injection from $\powerset S$ into $S$.


Proof
Lemma
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\powerset S$ be the power set of $S$.

Then there does not exist a set $B$ such that there is an injection from $B$ into $S$ and a surjection from $B$ onto $\powerset S$.
$\Box$

The identity mapping $I_{\powerset S}: \powerset S \to \powerset S$ is a surjection by Identity Mapping is Surjection.
Thus, by the lemma, there can be no injection from $\powerset S$ into $S$.
$\blacksquare$

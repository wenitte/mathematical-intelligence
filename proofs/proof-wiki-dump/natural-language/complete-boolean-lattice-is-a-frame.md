Theorem
Let $\struct{B, \vee, \wedge, \neg, \preceq}$ be a complete Boolean lattice.

Then:

$\struct{B, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ is a frame.
Proof
From Boolean Lattice is Heyting Lattice:

$\struct{B, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ is a complete Heyting lattice.
From Characterization of Locale:

$\struct{B, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ is a frame.
$\blacksquare$

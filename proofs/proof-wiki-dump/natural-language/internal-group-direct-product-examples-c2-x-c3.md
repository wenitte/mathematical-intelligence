Example of Internal Group Direct Product
The direct product of the cyclic groups $C_2$ and $C_3$ is isomorphic to the cyclic groups $C_6$.
Hence it is seen to be an internal group direct product.


Proof
Let $x$ be a generator for $C_6$.
Let $G_1$ be the subgroup of $C_6$ generated by $x^2$.
Let $G_2$ be the subgroup of $C_6$ generated by $x^3$.
From Subgroup of Abelian Group is Normal, both $G_1$ and $G_2$ are normal in $G$.

Then we have:














\(\ds e\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e \cdot e\)





where $e$ is the identity of $G$, $G_1$ and $G_2$














\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {x^2}^2 \cdot x^3\)




















\(\ds x^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x^2 \cdot e\)




















\(\ds x^3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e \cdot x^3\)




















\(\ds x^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {x^2}^2 \cdot e\)




















\(\ds x^5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x^2 \cdot x^3\)









and so the conditions are fulfilled for $G_1 \times G_2$ to be an internal group direct product.

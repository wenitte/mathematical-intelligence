Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $H \le G$, where $\le$ denotes the property of being a subgroup.
Let $x \in H$.

Then the order of $x$ in $H$ equals the order of $x$ in $G$.


Proof
Let $\gen x$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by $x$.
By definition, $\gen x \le G$.
All the elements of $\gen x$ are powers of $x$.
As $x \in H$ it follows by Group Axiom $\text G 0$: Closure that all the powers of $x$ are elements of $H$.
That is:

$\gen x \le H$
By Order of Cyclic Group equals Order of Generator:

$\order x = \order {\gen x}$
But $\gen x$ is the same cyclic group whether it is considered as embedded in $H$ or $G$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

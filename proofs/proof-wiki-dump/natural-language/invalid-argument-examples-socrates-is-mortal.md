Example of Invalid Argument
This argument is technically invalid:

Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.


Proof
It may be thought that the conclusion may hence be deduced from the premise.
However, this does so purely because of the a priori knowledge that:

if $A$ is a man, then $A$ is mortal.
Hence while the conclusion follows from the premise, this does not happen purely by means of deduction from the argument itself.

Let $P$ denote the simple statement Socrates is a man..
Let $Q$ denote the simple statement Socrates is mortal..

The argument can then be expressed as:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds P\)

\(\)







\(\ds \)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \therefore \ \ \)





\(\ds Q\)

\(\)







\(\ds \)









But this is not a valid argument form.

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $237$
The Mudbury War Memorial
The inhabitants of Mudbury recently erected a war memorial,
and they proposed to enclose a piece of ground on which it stands with posts.
They found that if they set up the posts $1$ foot asunder they would have too few by $150$.
But if they placed them a yard asunder there would be too many by $70$.
How many posts had they in hand?


Solution
They had $180$ posts.
The memorial ground was $110$ yards, that is $330$ feet, around.


Proof
Recall there are $3$ feet to the yard.
Let $d$ yards be the length of the perimeter of the war memorial ground.
Let $p$ be the number of posts they have.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 3 d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds p + 150\)





They found that if they set up the posts $1$ foot asunder they would have too few by $150$.




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds p - 70\)





But if they placed them a yard asunder there would be too many by $70$.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 220\)





$(1) - (2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 110\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 110 + 70 = 180\)





substituting from $(2)$



Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

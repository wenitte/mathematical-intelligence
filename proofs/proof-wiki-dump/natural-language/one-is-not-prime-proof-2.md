Theorem
The integer $1$ (one) is not a prime number.


Proof
From Divisor Sum of Prime Number, the sum $\map {\sigma_1} p$ of all the positive integer divisors of a prime number $p$ is $p + 1$.
But from Divisor Sum of 1, $\map {\sigma_1} 1 = 1$.
If $1$ were to be classified as prime, then $\map {\sigma_1} 1$ would be an exception to the rule that $\map {\sigma_1} p = p + 1$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The reasoning that $1$ should be excluded from the set of prime numbers based on its divisor sum was by Leonhard Paul Euler.

Theorem
Let $x$ be an ordinal.
Let $\card x$ denote the cardinal number of $x$.

Then:

$x \sim \card x$
where $\sim$ denotes set equivalence.


Proof
From Set is Equivalent to Itself:

$x \sim x$
Therefore, $x$ is equivalent to some ordinal.
By Condition for Set Equivalent to Cardinal Number:

$x \sim \card x$
$\blacksquare$

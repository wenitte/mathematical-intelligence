Theorem
Let $\struct {A, \ast, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a $\text C^\ast$-algebra.
Let $\le$ be the canonical preordering on $A$.
Let $a, b \in A$ be such that $a \le b$. 
Let $c \in A$.

Then $c^\ast a c \le c^\ast b c$.


Proof
Since $a \le b$, we have that $b - a$ is positive.
Hence $c^\ast \paren {b - a} c$ is positive by Conjugation in C*-Algebra preserves Positivity.
Hence $c^\ast b c - c^\ast a c$ is positive.
By the definition of $\le$, we have $c^\ast a c \le c^\ast b c$. 
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group on $n$ letters.
Every finite group is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$ for some $n \in \Z$.


Proof
Let $H = \set e$.
We can apply Permutation of Cosets to $H$ so that:

$\mathbb S = G$
and:

$\map \ker \theta = \set e$
The result follows by the First Isomorphism Theorem for Groups.
$\blacksquare$

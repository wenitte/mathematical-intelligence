Theorem
The classical probability model is a probability measure.


Proof
We check all the Kolmogorov axioms in turn:


First Axiom
From Empty Set is Subset of All Sets and from the definitions of the event space and sample space:

$\O \subseteq \Sigma \subseteq \Omega$
From Cardinality of Empty Set and Cardinality of Subset of Finite Set:

$0 \le \card \Sigma \le \card \Omega$
Dividing all terms by $\card \Omega$:

$0 \le \dfrac {\card \Sigma} {\card \Omega} \le 1$
The middle term is the asserted definition of $\map \Pr {\, \cdot \,}$.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Link to a page expanding on that statement -- perhaps better to say that it's the definition of the image of Pr?You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
$\Box$


Second Axiom
By hypothesis:

$\map \Pr \Omega = \dfrac {\card \Omega} {\card \Omega} = 1$
$\Box$


Third Axiom
Follows from Cardinality is Additive Function and the corollary to the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.
$\blacksquare$

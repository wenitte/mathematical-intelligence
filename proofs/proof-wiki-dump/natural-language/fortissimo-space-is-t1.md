Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a Fortissimo space.

Then $T$ is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.


Proof
From Fortissimo Space is Excluded Point Space with Countable Complement Space, $T$ is an expansion of a countable complement space.
Then we have that a Countable Complement Space is $T_1$.

Then from Separation Properties Preserved by Expansion we have that as a cuntable  complement space is a $T_1$ space, then so is $T$.
$\blacksquare$

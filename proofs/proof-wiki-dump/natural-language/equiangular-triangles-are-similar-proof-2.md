Theorem
Equiangular Triangles are Similar

Proof

Let $\triangle ABC$ be any triangle.
Let $\triangle ADE$ be equiangular with it.
Draw the triangles so they coincide at one vertex and the bases are parallel.
By Equal Alternate Angles implies Parallel Lines:

$BC \parallel DE$
Draw the altitude $AFG$ to both $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ADE$.  
(For an obtuse triangle, the altitude need not lie inside $\triangle ADE$).  
$\triangle ABF$, $\triangle ADG$, $\triangle ACF$ and $\triangle AEF$ are all right triangles.
By what we had above:
$\triangle ABF$ and $\triangle ADG$ are equiangular.
The same is true of $\triangle ACF$ and $\triangle AEG$.
By Equiangular Right Triangles are Similar:

$\dfrac {AB} {AD} = \dfrac {AF} {AG}$
$\dfrac {AC} {AE} = \dfrac {AF} {AG}$
Rearranging:

$\dfrac {AB} {AD} = \dfrac {AC} {AE}$
We have equal ratios of sides.
But we can do this for any two sides of the two triangles.

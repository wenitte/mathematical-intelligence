Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
We three Loves stand here pouring out water for the bath, sending streams into the fair-flowing tank.
I on the right, from my long-winged feet, fill it full in the sixth part of a day;
I on the left, from my jar, fill it in four hours;
and I in the middle, from my bow, in just half a day.
Tell me in what a short time we should fill it, pouring water from wings, bow and jar all at once.


Solution
First note that the day in this context is taken to be $12$ hours long.

Let $t$ be the number of days it takes to fill the tank.
Let $a, b, c$ be the flow rate in numbers of tanks per day of (respectively) the Loves on the right, the left and the middle.

In $t$ days, the various contributions of each of the spouts is $a t$, $b t$ and $c t$ respectively.
So for the total contribution to be $1$ tank, we have:















\(\ds \paren {a + b + c} t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {a + b + c}\)










We have:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)





that is, $1$ tank in $\dfrac 1 6$ of a day














\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {12} 4 = 3\)





that is, $1$ tank in $4$ hours which is $\dfrac 4 {12}$ of a day














\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)





that is, $1$ tank in $\dfrac 1 2$ days




and so:














\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {a + b + c}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {6 + 3 + 2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {11}\)









So the tank will be filled in $\dfrac 1 {11}$ of a day.
$\blacksquare$

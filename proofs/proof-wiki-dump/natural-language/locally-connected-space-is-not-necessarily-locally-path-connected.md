Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is locally connected.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $T$ is also an locally patj-connected space.


Proof
Let $T$ be a countable finite complement Space.
From Finite Complement Space is Locally Connected, $T$ is a locally connected space.
From Countable Finite Complement Space is not Locally Path-Connected, $T$ is not a locally path-connected space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

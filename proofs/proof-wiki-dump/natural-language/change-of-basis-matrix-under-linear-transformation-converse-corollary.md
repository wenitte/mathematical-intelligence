Corollary to Change of Basis Matrix under Linear Transformation: Converse
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $G$ be a free unitary $R$-module of finite dimensions $n$.
Let $\sequence {a_n}$ be an ordered basis of $G$.

Let $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ be square matrices of order $n$ over $R$.
Let there exist an nonsingular matrix $\mathbf P$ of order $n$ such that:

$\mathbf B = \mathbf P^{-1} \mathbf A \mathbf P$

Then there exist:

a linear operator $u$ on $G$
an ordered basis $\sequence { {a_n}'}$ of $G$
such that:

$\mathbf A = \sqbrk {u; \sequence {a_n} }$
$\mathbf B = \sqbrk {u; \sequence { {a_n}'} }$
where $\sqbrk {u; \sequence {a_n} }$ denotes the matrix of $u$ relative to $\sequence {a_n}$.


Proof
Follows directly from Change of Basis Matrix under Linear Transformation: Converse.

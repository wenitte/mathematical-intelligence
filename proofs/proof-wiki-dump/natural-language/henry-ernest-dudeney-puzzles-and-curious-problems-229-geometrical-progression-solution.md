Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $229$
Geometrical Progression
Write out a series of whole numbers in geometrical progression, starting from $1$,
so that the numbers should add up to a square.
Thus, $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63$.
But this is one short of being a square.


Solution
$121 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = 11^2$
$400 = 7^0 + 7^1 + 7^2 + 7^3 = 20^2$


Proof
This is explored in Square Numbers which are Sum of Consecutive Powers.
$\blacksquare$

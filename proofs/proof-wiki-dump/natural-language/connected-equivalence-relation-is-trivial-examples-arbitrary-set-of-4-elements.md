Example of Connected Equivalence Relation is Trivial
Let $V = \set {a, b, c, d}$.
Let $S \subseteq V \times V$ such that:

$S = \set {\tuple {a, b}, \tuple {b, c}, \tuple {c, d} }$
Let $\RR$ be an equivalence relation on $V$ such that:

$S \subseteq \RR$
Then $\RR$ is the trivial relation on $S$.


Proof
By definition, $\RR$ is connected.
We also have that $\RR$ is an equivalence relation.
The result follows from Connected Equivalence Relation is Trivial.
$\blacksquare$

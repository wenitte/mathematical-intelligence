Example of Linear Congruence
The linear congruence:

$15 x \equiv 6 \pmod {18}$
has $3$ solutions:

$x = 4, 10, 16$


Proof
We have that:

$\gcd \set {15, 18} = 3$
Then we note that $3$ is a divisor of $6$.
Hence by Solution of Linear Congruence, $15 x \equiv 6 \pmod {18}$ has $3$ solutions in the integers, given by:

$\dfrac {15} 3 x \equiv \dfrac 6 3 \paren {\bmod \dfrac {18} 3}$
that is:

$5 x \equiv 2 \pmod 6$
which leads us to:

$x = 4 + 2 t$
for $t = 0, 1, 2$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

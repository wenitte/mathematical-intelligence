Theorem
Every proposition entails itself:

$\vdash p \implies p$


Proof
We apply the Method of Truth Tables to the proposition.
As can be seen by inspection, the truth value under the main connective is $\T$ throughout.
$\begin{array}{|ccc|} \hline
p & \implies & p \\
\hline
\F & \T & \F \\
\T & \T & \T \\
\hline
\end{array}$
$\blacksquare$

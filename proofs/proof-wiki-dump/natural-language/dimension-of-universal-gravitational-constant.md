Theorem
The dimension of the universal gravitational constant $G$ is $M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}$.


Proof
From Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:

$\mathbf F = \dfrac {G m_1 m_2 \mathbf r} {r^3}$
We have that:

The dimension of force is $M L T^{-2}$
The dimension of displacement is $L$
The dimension of mass is $M$.
Let $x$ be the dimension of $G$.
Then we have:

$M L T^{-2} = x \dfrac {M^2 L}{L^3}$
Hence, after algebra:

$x = M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}$
$\blacksquare$

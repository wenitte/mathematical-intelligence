Theorem
A metric space is separable if and only if it is second-countable.


Proof
Follows directly from:

Separable Metric Space is Second-Countable
Second-Countable Space is Separable
$\blacksquare$


Axiom of Countable Choice
This theorem depends on the Axiom of Countable Choice, by way of Second-Countable Space is Separable.
Although not as strong as the Axiom of Choice, the Axiom of Countable Choice is similarly independent of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms.
As such, mathematicians are generally convinced of its truth and believe that it should be generally accepted.

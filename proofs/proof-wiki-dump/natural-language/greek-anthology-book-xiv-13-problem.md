Problem
We both of us together weigh twenty minae, I, Zethus, and my brother;
and if you take the third part of me and the fourth part of Amphion here, you will find it makes six,
and you will have found the weight of our mother.


Solution
Let $z$ be the weight in minae of Zethus.
Let $a$ be the weight in minae of Amphion.

We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds z + a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \frac z 3 + \frac a 4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4 z + 3 a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 72\)





multiplying $(2)$ by $12$ to clear fractions




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4 z + 4 a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 80\)





multiplying $(1)$ by $4$




\(\text {(5)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8\)





subtracting $(3)$ from $(4)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)





substituting for $a$ in $(1)$ and simplifying




So:

Zethus weighs $12$ minae
Amphion weighs $8$ minae
and (presumably):

their mother weighs $6$ minae.
$\blacksquare$

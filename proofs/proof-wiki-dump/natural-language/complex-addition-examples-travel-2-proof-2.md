Example of Complex Addition
An airplane travels:

$150$ kilometres southeast
then:

$100$ kilometres due west
then:

$225$ kilometres $30 \degrees$ north of east
then:

$323$ kilometres northeast.

Assuming the curvature of Earth to be negligible at this scale, at the end of this travel, the plane is $490$ kilometres in a direction $28.7 \degrees$ north of east from its starting point.


Proof
By plotting the points in a graphics package, or on paper with a ruler and protractor:




$\blacksquare$

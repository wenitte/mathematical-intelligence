Theorem
Let $\RR_1 \subseteq S_1 \times T_1$ and $\RR_2 \subseteq S_2 \times T_2$ be relations.
Let $\RR_2 \circ \RR_1 \subseteq S_1 \times T_2$ be the composition of $\RR_1$ and $\RR_2$.
Let $x \in S_1$.

Then:

$\RR_2 \sqbrk {\map {\RR_1} x \cap S_2} = \map {\paren{\RR_2 \circ \RR_1}} x$


Proof
We have:














\(\ds \RR_2 \sqbrk {\map {\RR_1} x \cap S_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \RR_2 \sqbrk {\RR_1 \sqbrk {\set x} \cap S_2}\)

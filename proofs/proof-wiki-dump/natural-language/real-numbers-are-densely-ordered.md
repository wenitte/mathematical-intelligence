Corollary to Between two Real Numbers exists Rational Number
$\forall a, b \in \R: a < b \implies \paren {\exists c \in \R: a < c < b}$

That is, the set of real numbers is densely ordered.


Proof 1
We can express $a$ and $b$ as:

$a = \dfrac a 1, b = \dfrac b 1$
Thus from Mediant is Between:

$\dfrac a 1 < \dfrac {a + b} {1 + 1} < \dfrac b 1$
Hence $c = \dfrac {a + b} 2$ is an element of $\R$ between $a$ and $b$.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
From Between two Real Numbers exists Rational Number:

$\exists r \in \Q: a < r < b$
Since a rational number is also a real number, the result follows by definition.
$\blacksquare$

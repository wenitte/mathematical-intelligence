Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $33$
De Alio Patrefamilias Erogante Suae Familiae Annonam
Another Landlord Apportioning Grain
A gentleman has a household of $30$ persons and directs that they be given $30$ measures of grain.
He directs that:
each man should receive $3$ measures,
each woman $2$ measures,
and each child $\frac 1 2$ a measure.
How many men, women and children must there be?


$\text {33 a}$: Variant
A gentleman has a household of $90$ persons and ordered that they be given $90$ measures of grain.
He directs that:
each man should receive $3$ measures,
each woman $2$ measures,
and each child $\frac 1 2$ a measure.
How many men, women and children must there be?


Solution
$3$ men, $5$ women and $22$ children.


Proof
Let $m$, $w$ and $c$ denote the number of men, women and children respectively.
We have:














\(\ds 3 m + 2 w + \dfrac c 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 30\)





apportioning the measures of grain




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 m + 4 w + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds m + w + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 30\)





the total number of people








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 m + 3 w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 30\)





$(1) - (2)$



We note that $5 m$ is a multiple of $5$.
Hence $3 w$ also has to be a multiple of $5$.
Thus $w$ has to be a multiple of $5$.
Hence the following possible solutions for $m$ and $w$:














\(\ds w = 0\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 6\)




















\(\ds w = 5\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 3\)




















\(\ds w = 10\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 0\)









It is implicit that there are at least some men and some women in the household, so the solutions:

$m = 6, w = 0, c = 24$
$m = 0, w = 10, c = 20$
are usually ruled out.
Hence we have:

$m = 3, w = 5, c = 22$
$\blacksquare$

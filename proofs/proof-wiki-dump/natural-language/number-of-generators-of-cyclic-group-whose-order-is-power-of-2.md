Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite cyclic group.
Let the order of $G$ be $2^k$ for some $k \in \Z_{>0}$.

Then $G$ has $2^{n - 1}$ distinct generators.


Proof
From Finite Cyclic Group has Euler Phi Generators, $G$ has $\map \phi {2^n}$ generators.
The result follows from corollary to Euler Phi Function of Prime Power.
$\blacksquare$

It has been suggested that this page be renamed.In particular: This can't really be a corollary of an equivalence definitionTo discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.
Theorem
Let $V$ be a normed vector space, and let $L$ be a bounded linear functional on $V$.

For all $v \in V$, the following inequality holds:

$\size {L v} \le \norm L \norm v$

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Define $\norm L$ and $\norm v$You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.


Proof
If $v = \mathbf 0$ there is nothing to prove.
Let $v \ne \mathbf 0$.
By the definition of the supremum:

$\dfrac {\size {L v} } {\norm v} \le \norm L_3 = \norm L$

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: What is this $\norm L_3$You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
whence:

$\size {L v} \le \norm L \norm v$
$\blacksquare$

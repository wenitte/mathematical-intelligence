Theorem
$S \subseteq T \iff S \cap \map \complement T = \O$
where:

$S \subseteq T$ denotes that $S$ is a subset of $T$
$S \cap T$ denotes the intersection of $S$ and $T$
$\O$ denotes the empty set
$\complement$ denotes set complement.


Corollary
$S \cap T = \O \iff S \subseteq \relcomp {} T$


Proof













\(\ds S\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds T\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds S \setminus T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \O\)





Set Difference with Superset is Empty Set‎








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds S \cap \map \complement T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \O\)





Set Difference as Intersection with Complement

Also presented as
Some sources present this as an alternative definition of a subset:

Set $A$ is a subset of set $B$ if set $A$ contains no member that is not also in set $B$
but this is not mainstream.

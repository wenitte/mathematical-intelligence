Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a regular space.
Let $\BB$ be a $\sigma$-locally finite basis.

Then:

$T$ is a normal space
Proof
By definition of regular space:

$T$ is a $T_3$ space
$T$ is a $T_0$ (Kolmogorov) space
From Regular Space is $T_2$ Space:

$T$ is a $T_2$ space
From $T_2$ Space is $T_1$ Space:

$T$ is a $T_1$ space
From $T_3$ Space with Sigma-Locally Finite Basis is $T_4$ Space:

$T$ is a $T_4$ space
By definition, $T$ is a normal space.
$\blacksquare$

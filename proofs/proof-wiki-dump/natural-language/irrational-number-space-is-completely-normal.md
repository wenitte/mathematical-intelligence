Theorem
Let $\struct {\R \setminus \Q, \tau_d}$ be the irrational number space under the Euclidean topology $\tau_d$.

Then $\struct {\R \setminus \Q, \tau_d}$ is a completely normal space.


Proof
From Euclidean Space is Complete Metric Space, a Euclidean space is a metric space.
Hence in particular $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ is a metric space.
From Subspace of Metric Space is Metric Space, it follows that $\struct {\R \setminus \Q, \tau_d}$ is likewise a metric space.
From Metric Space fulfils all Separation Axioms it follows that $\struct {\R \setminus \Q, \tau_d}$ is a completely normal space.

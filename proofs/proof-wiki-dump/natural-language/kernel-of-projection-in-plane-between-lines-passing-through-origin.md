Theorem
Let $M$ and $N$ be distinct lines in the plane both of which pass through the origin $O$.

Let $\pr_{M, N}$ be the projection on $M$ along $N$:

$\forall x \in \R^2: \map {\pr_{M, N} } x =$ the intersection of $M$ with the line through $x$ parallel to $N$.

Then $N$ is the kernel of $\pr_{M, N}$.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: As the kernel is a concept defined in relation to a homomorphism, it needs to be clarified what homomorphism is being considered.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Proof
Let $\LL$ be the straight line through $x$ which is parallel to $N$.
Let $\map {\pr_{M, N} } x = \tuple {0, 0}$.
By definition, $\map {\pr_{M, N} } x$ is the intersection of $M$ with $\LL$.
However, as $\map {\pr_{M, N} } x = \tuple {0, 0}$, it follows that $\LL$ is coincident with $N$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

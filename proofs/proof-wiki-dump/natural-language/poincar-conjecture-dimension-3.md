Theorem
Let $\Sigma^3$ be a smooth $3$-manifold.
Let $\Sigma^3$ satisfy:

$H_0 \struct {\Sigma; \Z} = 0$
and:

$H_3 \struct {\Sigma; \Z} = \Z$
Then $\Sigma^3$ is homeomorphic to the $3$-sphere $\Bbb S^3$.

Historical Note
The Poincar√© Conjecture for a long time was settled for all dimensions but $3$.
Grigori Perelman finally provided the missing piece by demonstrating the truth of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture in $2003$.

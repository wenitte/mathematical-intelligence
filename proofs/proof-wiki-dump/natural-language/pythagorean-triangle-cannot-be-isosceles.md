Theorem
Let $P$ be a Pythagorean triangle.
Then $P$ is not isosceles.


Theorem
Let $P$ be a Pythagorean triangle.
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $P$ is an isosceles.
Let the legs of $P$ be of length $a$.
Let the hypotenuse of $P$ be of length $h$.
We have from Pythagoras's Theorem that:

$2 a^2 = h^2$
and so:

$\dfrac h a = \sqrt 2$
By definition, $h$ and $a$ are integers.
Hence, by definition, $\sqrt 2$ is a rational number.
But that contradicts the result Square Root of 2 is Irrational.
By Proof by Contradiction, it follows that $P$ cannot be isosceles.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $F$ be a mapping.
Let $A$ be a small class.

Then the restriction $F {\restriction_A}$ is a small class.


Proof
The domain of $F {\restriction_A}$ is a subset of $A$.
By Axiom of Subsets Equivalents, the domain is a small class.
By Mapping whose Domain is Small Class is Small, it follows that $F {\restriction_A}$ is a small class.

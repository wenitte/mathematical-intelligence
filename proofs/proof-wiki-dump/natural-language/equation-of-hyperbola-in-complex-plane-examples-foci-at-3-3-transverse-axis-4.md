Example of Equation of Hyperbola in Complex Plane
The hyperbola in the complex plane whose transverse axis is of length $4$ and whose foci are at the points corresponding to $-3$ and $3$ is given by the equation:

$\cmod {z + 3} - \cmod {z - 3} = 4$


Proof
From Equation of Hyperbola in Complex Plane, the hyperbola whose transverse axis is $d$ and whose foci are at the points corresponding to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is given by:

$\cmod {z - \alpha} - \cmod {z - \beta} = d$




The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

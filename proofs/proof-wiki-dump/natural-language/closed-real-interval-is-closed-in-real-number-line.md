Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.
Let $\closedint a b$ be a closed interval of $\R$.

Then $\closedint a b$ is closed (in the topological sense) in $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$.


Proof
From Open Sets in Real Number Line:

$U := \openint \gets a \cup \openint b \to$
is an open set in $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$.
Consider the complement relative to $\R$:

$V := \relcomp \R U = \closedint a b$
By definition, $\relcomp \R U$ is closed (in the topological sense) in $\struct {\R, \tau_d}$.
But by construction:

$\relcomp \R U = \closedint a b$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq_1}$ be an ordered set.
Let $\struct {S, \preceq_2}$ be a dual ordered set of $\struct {S, \preceq_1}$
Let $X \subseteq S$.

Then:

$X$ is filtered in $\struct {S, \preceq_1}$
if and only if:

$X$ is directed in $\struct {S, \preceq_2}$


Proof
By Dual of Dual Ordering:

$\struct {S, \preceq_1}$ is the dual of $\struct {S, \preceq_2}$.
Thus by Directed iff Filtered in Dual Ordered Set:

$X$ is filtered in $\struct {S, \preceq_1}$
if and only if:

$X$ is directed in $\struct {S, \preceq_2}$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be the Arens-Fort space.

Every neighborhood of $\tuple {0, 0}$ is closed in $T$.


Proof
Let $H \subseteq S$ such that:

$\exists U \in \tau: \tuple {0, 0} \in U \subseteq H \subseteq S$
that is: such that $H$ is a neighborhood of $\tuple {0, 0}$ in $T$.
As $\tuple {0, 0} \in H$ it follows that $\tuple {0, 0} \notin \relcomp S H$.
So, by definition of the Arens-Fort space, $\relcomp S H$ is open in $T$.
So by definition, we have that $H$ is closed.
$\blacksquare$

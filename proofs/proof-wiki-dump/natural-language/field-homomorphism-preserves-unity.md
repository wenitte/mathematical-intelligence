Theorem
Let $\phi: \struct {F_1, +_1, \times_1} \to \struct {F_2, +_2, \times_2}$ be a field homomorphism.
Let:

$1_{F_1}$ be the unity of $F_1$
$1_{F_2}$ be the unity of $F_2$.

Then:

$\map \phi {1_{F_1} } = 1_{F_2}$


Proof
By definition, if $\struct {F_1, +_1, \times_1}$ and $\struct {F_2, +_2, \times_2}$ are fields then $\struct {F_1^*, \times_1}$ and $\struct {F_2^*, \times_2}$ are groups.
Again by definition:

the unity of $\struct {F_1, +_1, \times_1}$ is the identity of $\struct {F_1^*, \times_1}$
the unity of $\struct {F_2, +_2, \times_2}$ is the identity of $\struct {F_2^*, \times_2}$.

The result follows from Group Homomorphism Preserves Identity.

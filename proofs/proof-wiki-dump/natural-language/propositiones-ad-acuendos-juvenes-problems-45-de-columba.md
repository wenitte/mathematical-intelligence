Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $45$
De Columba
A Pigeon
A pigeon sitting in a tree saw others flying, and said to them:
"I wish there were others with you --
the same number again and a third time.
Then with one of me, there would be $100$."
How many pigeons were there at first?


Solution
$33$


Proof
Let $x$ years be the number of pigeons there at first.
Then we have:














\(\ds \paren {x + x + x} + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





The number plus the same number plus the same number again plus $1$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 3 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 99\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 33\)









$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau_{\bar p}}\right)$ be an excluded point space.

Then $T^*_{\bar p}$ is a connected space.


Proof 1
We have:

Excluded Point Topology is Open Extension Topology of Discrete Topology
Open Extension Space is Connected
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
The only open set of $T$ which contains $p$ is $S$.
Therefore it is impossible to set up a separation of $T$, as $S$ will always need to be an element of such a separation.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 3
Excluded Point Space is Ultraconnected
Ultraconnected Space is Path-Connected
Path-Connected Space is Connected
$\blacksquare$

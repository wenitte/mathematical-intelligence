Theorem
Let $\map u x$ be a differentiable real function of $x$.
Let $n$ be a real number such that $n \ne -1$.
Then:

$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\map u x^n} = n \map u x^{n - 1} \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\map u x}$


Proof













\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {\map u x^n}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d u} } {\map u x^n} \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {\map u x}\)

Theorem
Let $\NN$ denote the class of all cardinal numbers.
Let $x$ be an ordinal.

Then:

$x \in \NN \iff x = \card x$


Proof
Necessary Condition
Suppose $x = \card x$.
Then $x = \card y$ for some $y$ by Existential Generalisation.
By definition of class of all cardinals:

$\NN = \set {x \in \On: \exists y: x = \card y}$
It follows that $x \in \NN$.

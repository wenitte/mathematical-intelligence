Example of Diophantine Problem
To find $3$ numbers such that the product of any $2$ of them added to the $3$rd gives a square.
That is, let $\set {p, q, r}$ be a set of $3$ natural numbers such that:

$p q + r$ is square
$q r + p$ is square
$r p + q$ is square
What are those $3$ numbers?


Solution
The solution given by Diophantus of Alexandria is:

$\set {1, 7, 9}$
As can be seem:














\(\ds 1 \times 7 + 9\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4^2\)




















\(\ds 7 \times 9 + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 64\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8^2\)




















\(\ds 9 \times 1 + 7\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4^2\)











Proof
Take a square and subtract part of it for $r$.
Let $x^2 + 6 x + 9$ be $p q + r$, and let $r = 9$.
Hence:

$p q = x^2 + 6 x = x \paren {x + 6}$
Let $p = x$ so that $q = x + 6$.
By the two remaining conditions:

$10 x + 54$
$10 x + 6$
are both square.
Thus we need to find $2$ squares whose difference is $48$.
In the words of Diophantus of Alexandria:

This is easy and can be done in an infinite number of ways.
This of course is not true, but the squares $16$ and $64$ come directly to mind.
Equating these to the given expressions:














\(\ds 10 x + 54\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 64\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)









and also:














\(\ds 10 x + 6\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)









and so $p = 1$.
The final number $q = x + 6$ yields that $q = 7$.
$\blacksquare$

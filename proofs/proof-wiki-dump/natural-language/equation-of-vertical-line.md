Theorem
Let $\LL$ be a vertical line embedded in the Cartesian plane $\CC$.

Then the equation of $\LL$ can be given by:

$x = a$
where $\tuple {a, 0}$ is the point at which $\LL$ intersects the $x$-axis.





Proof
From the Normal Form of Equation of Straight Line in Plane, a general straight line can be expressed in the form:

$x \cos \alpha + y \sin \alpha = p$
where:

$p$ is the length of a perpendicular $\PP$ from $\LL$ to the origin.
$\alpha$ is the angle made between $\PP$ and the $x$-axis.
As $\LL$ is vertical, then by definition $\PP$ is horizontal.
By definition, the horizontal line through the origin is the $x$-axis itself.
Thus $\alpha = 0$ and $p = a$
Hence the equation of $\LL$ becomes:














\(\ds x \cos 0 + y \sin 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a\)





Sine of Zero is Zero, Cosine of Zero is One



Hence the result.

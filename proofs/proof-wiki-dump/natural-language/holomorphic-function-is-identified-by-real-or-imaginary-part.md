Theorem
Let $D \subseteq \C$ be an open subset of the set of complex numbers $\C$.
Let $f, gÂ : D \to \C$ be holomorphic functions such that either:

$\map \Re f = \map \Re g$
or:

$\map \Im f = \map \Im g$

Then $f = g$. 


Proof
From Combination Theorem for Complex Derivatives: Combined Sum Rule, we have:

$f - g$ is holomorphic.
Suppose first that:

$\map \Re f = \map \Re g$
Then:

$\map \Re {f - g} = 0$
Hence from Holomorphic Function with Constant Imaginary Part is Constant: Corollary, we have $f = g$. 
Suppose also that:

$\map \Im f = \map \Im g$
Then:

$\map \Im {f - g} = 0$
Hence from Holomorphic Function with Constant Imaginary Part is Constant, we have $f = g$.

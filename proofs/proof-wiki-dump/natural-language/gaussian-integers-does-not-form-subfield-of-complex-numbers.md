Theorem
The ring of Gaussian integers:

$\struct {\Z \sqbrk i, +, \times}$
is not a subfield of $\C$.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample:
We have that:

$2 + 0 i \in \Z \sqbrk i$
However there is no $z \in \Z \sqbrk i$ such that:

$x \paren {2 + 0 i} = 1 + 0 i$
So, by definition, $\Z \sqbrk i$ is not a field.
Thus $\Z \sqbrk i$ is not a subfield of $\C$.
$\blacksquare$

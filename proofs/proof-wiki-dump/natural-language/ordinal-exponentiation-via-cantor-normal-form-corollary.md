Theorem
Let $x$ and $y$ be ordinals.
Let $x$ be a limit ordinal and let $y > 0$.
Let $\sequence {a_i}$ be a sequence of ordinals that is strictly decreasing on $1 \le i \le n$.
Let $\sequence {b_i}$ be a sequence of natural numbers.

Then:

$\ds \paren {\sum_{i \mathop = 1}^n x^{a_i} \times b_i}^{x^y} = x^{a_1 \mathop \times x^y}$

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: what "Cantor normal form" is in the exposition of the above.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Proof
By the hypothesis, $x^y$ is a limit ordinal by Limit Ordinals Closed under Ordinal Exponentiation.

The result follows from Ordinal Exponentiation via Cantor Normal Form/Limit Exponents.
$\blacksquare$

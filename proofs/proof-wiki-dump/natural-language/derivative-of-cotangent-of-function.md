Theorem
Let $u$ be a differentiable real function of $x$.
Then:

$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\cot u} = -\csc^2 u \dfrac {\d u} {\d x}$
where $\cot$ is the cotangent function and $\csc$ is the cosecant function.


Proof













\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {\cot u}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d u} } {\cot u} \frac {\d u} {\d x}\)





Chain Rule for Derivatives














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\csc^2 u \frac {\d u} {\d x}\)

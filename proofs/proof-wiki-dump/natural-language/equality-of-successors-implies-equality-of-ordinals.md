Theorem
Let $\On$ denote the class of all ordinals.
Then:

$\forall \alpha, \beta \in \On: \alpha^+ = \beta^+ \implies \alpha = \beta$


Proof
From Class of All Ordinals is Well-Ordered by Subset Relation:

$\alpha^+$ is the immediate successor of $\alpha$
$\beta^+$ is the immediate successor of $\beta$
and no two distinct elements of $\On$ can have the same immediate successor.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

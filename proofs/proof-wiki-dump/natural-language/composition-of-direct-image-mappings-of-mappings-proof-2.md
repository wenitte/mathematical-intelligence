Theorem
Let $A, B, C$ be non-empty sets.
Let $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$ be mappings.

Let:

$f^\to: \powerset A \to \powerset B$
and

$g^\to: \powerset B \to \powerset C$
be the direct image mappings of $f$ and $g$.

Then:

$\paren {g \circ f}^\to = g^\to \circ f^\to$


Proof
We have that a mapping is a relation.
Hence Composition of Direct Image Mappings of Relations applies.

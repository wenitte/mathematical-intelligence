Theorem
The magic constant of a magic cube of order $n$ is given by:

$C_n = \dfrac {n \paren {n^3 + 1} } 2$


Proof
Let $M_n$ denote a magic cube of order $n$.
By Sum of Terms of Magic Cube, the total of all the entries in $M_n$ is given by:

$T_n = \dfrac {n^3 \paren {n^3 + 1}} 2$
There are $n^2$ rows in $M_n$, each one with the same magic constant.
Thus the magic constant $C_n$ of the magic cube $M_n$ is given by:














\(\ds C_n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {T_n} {n^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {n^3 \paren {n^3 + 1} } {2 n^2}\)





Sum of Terms of Magic Cube














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {n \paren {n^3 + 1} } 2\)

Sequence
The sequence of the magic constants of magic cubes of order $n$ begins:

$1, (9,) \, 42, 130, 315, 651, 1204, 2052, 3285, 5005, 7326, 10 \, 374, 14 \, 287, 19 \, 215, 25 \, 320, 32 \, 776, \ldots$
However, note that while $9 = \dfrac {2 \paren {2^3 + 1} } 2$, a magic cube of order $2$ does not actually exist.

Example of Generators of Cyclic Group
Consider the multiplicative group of real numbers $\struct {\R_{\ne 0}, \times}$.
Consider the subgroup $\gen 2$ of $\struct {\R_{\ne 0}, \times}$ generated by $2$.

Then:

$\dfrac 1 2$ is also a generator of $\gen 2$
but:

$4$ is not a generator of $\gen 2$.


Proof
We have that:

$\dfrac 1 2 = 2^{-1}$
and so:

$\dfrac 1 2 \in \gen 2$
Now let $x \in \gen 2$.
Then $x = 2^m$ for some $m \in \Z$.
It follows that:

$x = \paren {\dfrac 1 2}^{-m}$
for $-m \in \Z$.
Similarly, consider $\gen {\dfrac 1 2}$.
Let $y \in \gen {\dfrac 1 2}$.
Then $y = \paren {\dfrac 1 2}^{-r}$ for some $r \in \Z$.
It follows that:

$y = 2^{-r}$
for $-r \in \Z$.
Thus it is seen that:

$\gen 2 = \gen {\dfrac 1 2}$
and so $\dfrac 1 2$ is a generator of $\gen 2$.

From the argument in Element of Cyclic Group is not necessarily Generator it is seen that $4$ is not a generator of $\gen 2$.

Theorem
Let $M$ be a topological manifold.

The following definitions of the concept of Connected Manifold are equivalent:

Definition 1
$M$ is called a connected manifold if and only if $M$ is a connected topological space.

Definition 2
$M$ is called a (path-) connected manifold if and only if $M$ is a path-connected topological space.


Proof
Definition 1 implies Definition 2
Let $M$ be connected.
From Topological Manifold is Locally Path-Connected:

$M$ is locally path-connected.
From Connected and Locally Path-Connected Implies Path Connected:

$M$ is path-connected.
$\Box$


Definition 2 implies Definition 1
Follows immediately from Path-Connected Space is Connected.
$\blacksquare$

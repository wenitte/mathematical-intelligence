Theorem
Let $\KK$ be a rectangular hyperbola.
The asymptotes of $\KK$ are perpendicular.


Proof
Let $\KK$ be embedded in a cartesian plane in reduced form with the equation:

$x^2 - y^2 = a^2$
From Asymptotes to Hyperbola in Reduced Form, the asymptotes of $\KK$ can be expressed in the form:

$y = \pm \dfrac b a x$

By definition of a rectangular hyperbola, $\KK$ is such that:

$a = b$
Hence the asymptotes of $\KK$ can be expressed in the form:

$y = \pm x$
The slope of $y = x$ is $1$.
The slope of $y = -x$ is $-1$.
We have that:

$1 = - \dfrac 1 {-1}$
Hence the result, from Condition for Straight Lines in Plane to be Perpendicular: Slope Form.
$\blacksquare$

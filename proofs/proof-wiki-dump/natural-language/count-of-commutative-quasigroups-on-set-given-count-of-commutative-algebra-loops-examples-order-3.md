Examples of Use of Count of Commutative Quasigroups on Set given Count of Commutative Algebra Loops
Let $S$ have exactly $3$ elements.
There are $6$ quasigroups $\struct {S, \otimes}$ on $S$ such that $\otimes$ is a commutative operation.


Proof
Let $e \in S$ be a distinguished element of $S$.
Let $N$ be the number of quasigroups $\struct {S, \otimes}$ on $S$ such that $\otimes$ is a commutative operation.
From Count of Commutative Quasigroups on Set given Count of Commutative Algebra Loops we have that:

$N = n! m$
where:

$n$ is the cardinality of $S$
$m$ is the number of commutative operations $\oplus$ on $S$ such that $\struct {S, \oplus}$ is an algebra loop whose identity is $e$.
In this case, we have:

$n = 3$ by hypothesis
$m = 1$ from Algebra Loops of Order 3
Hence:

$N = 3! \times 1 = 6$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers.

The integers $\Z$ are dense in the closed ball $\map {B^-_1} 0$.


Proof
We have:














\(\ds \map {B^-_1} 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {B^-_{p^0} } 0\)





Zeroth Power of Real Number equals One














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0 + p^0 \Z_p\)





Closed Balls of P-adic Number














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0 + 1 \cdot \Z_p\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0 + \Z_p\)





Definition of Multiplicative Identity














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \Z_p\)





Definition of Additive Identity




From Integers are Dense in P-adic Integers, the integers $\Z$ are dense in the closed ball $\map {B^-_1} 0$.

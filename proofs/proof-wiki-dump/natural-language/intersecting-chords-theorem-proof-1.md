Theorem
Let $AC$ and $BD$ both be chords of the same circle.
Let $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$.

Then $AE \cdot EC = DE \cdot EB$.


Proof

Let $AC$ and $BD$ be intersecting chords of circle $ABCD$.
Let the point of intersection be $E$.
If $E$ is the center of $ABCD$ the solution is trivial, as $AE = EC = BE = ED$ and so $AE \cdot EC = BE \cdot ED$.
Otherwise, let $F$ be the center of $ABCD$.
Let $FG$ be drawn perpendicular to $AC$, and $FH$ be drawn perpendicular to $BD$.
From Conditions for Diameter to be Perpendicular Bisector, $G$ bisects $AC$ and $H$ bisects $BD$.
So $AG = GC$ and $BH = HD$.
From Difference of Two Squares we have that $AE \cdot EC + EG^2 = GC^2$.
Let us add $GF^2$ to these.
So $AE \cdot EC + EG^2 + GF^2 = GC^2 + GF^2$.
But from Pythagoras's Theorem we have that:

$GC^2 + GF^2 = CF^2$
$EG^2 + GF^2 = EF^2$
So:

$AE \cdot EC + EF^2 = CF^2$
Using the same construction, we have that:

$DE \cdot EB + EF^2 = BF^2$
But $BF = CF$ as both are the radius of the circle $ABCD$.
That gives us:

$AE \cdot EC + EF^2 = DE \cdot EB + EF^2$
It follows that $AE \cdot EC = DE \cdot EB$
$\blacksquare$

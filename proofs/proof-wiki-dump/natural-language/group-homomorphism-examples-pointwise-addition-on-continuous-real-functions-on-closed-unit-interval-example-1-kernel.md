Example of Group Homomorphism
Let $J \subseteq \R$ denote the closed unit interval $\closedint 0 1$.
Let $\map {\mathscr C} J$ denote the set of all continuous real functions from $J$ to $\R$.
Let $G = \struct {\map {\mathscr C} J, +}$ denote the group formed on $\map {\mathscr C} J$ by pointwise addition.
Let $\struct {\R, +}$ denote the additive group of real numbers.
Let $I_J$ denote the identity mapping on $J$:

$\forall x \in J: \map {I_J} x = x$

Let $\phi: \struct {\map {\mathscr C} J, +} \to \struct {\R, +}$ be the homomorphism defined as:

$\forall f \in \map {\mathscr C} J: \map \phi f = \map f 1$

The kernel of $\phi$ is given by:

$\map \ker \phi = I_J - f_m$
where:

$f_m: \R \to \R$ denotes the constant mapping on $\R$
$m = 1$
$I_J$ denotes the identity mapping on $J$.


Proof
From Group Homomorphism: Example 1, we have that $\phi$ is indeed a homomorphism.
For all $c \in \R$, let $f_c: \R \to \R$ be the constant mapping:

$\forall x \in \R: \map {f_c} x = c$

First we show that:

$\forall c \in \R: \map \phi {f_c} = c$

Let $c \in \R$ be arbitrary.
We have:














\(\ds \map \phi {f_c}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {f_c} 1\)





Definition of $\phi$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds c\)





Definition of Constant Mapping



$\Box$

Then we show that there exists a unique $m \in \R$ such that:

$\map \phi {I_J - f_m} = 0$
where in this case:

$m = 1$

We have:














\(\ds \map \phi {I_J - f_m}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {\paren {I_J - f_m} } 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





Definition of $\phi$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {I_J} 1 + \paren {-\map {f_m} 1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





Definition of Pointwise Addition of Real-Valued Functions








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 1 + \paren {-m}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





Definition of Identity Mapping, Definition of Constant Mapping








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)









Hence the result by definition of kernel.

Solution


Mistake
How can two regular hexagons, of different sizes, be dissected into seven pieces which fit together to make one, larger, regular hexagon?


Correction
The number of pieces needed in the construction given is in fact $13$.
The smaller regular hexagon is $1$ piece.
The larger regular hexagon is cut into $6$ triangles.
Each of these triangles is then each cut into $2$ pieces which are then assembled around the outside of the smaller regular hexagon
Thus a total of $13$ pieces.
$\blacksquare$

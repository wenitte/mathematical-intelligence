Theorem
The magic constant of the order $3$ magic square is $15$.


Proof
Let $M_n$ denote the magic square of order $n$.
By Magic Constant of Magic Square, the magic constant of $M_n$ is given by:

$S_n = \dfrac {n \left({n^2 + 1}\right)} 2$
Setting $n = 3$:

$S_3 = \dfrac {3 \times 10} 2 = 15$
$\blacksquare$

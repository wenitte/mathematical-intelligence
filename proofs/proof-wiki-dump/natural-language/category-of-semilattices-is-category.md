Theorem
Let $\mathbf{SLat}$ denote the category of semilattices.

Then:

$\mathbf{SLat}$ is a metacategory
Proof
Let us verify the axioms $(\text C 1)$ up to $(\text C 3)$ for a metacategory.

For any two semilattice homomorphisms their composition (in the usual set theoretic sense) is again a semilattice homomorphism by Composite Semilattice Homomorphisms is Semilattice Homomorphism.

For any semilattice $\struct{S, \circ}$, we have the identity mapping $\operatorname{id}_S$.
From Identity Mapping is Semilattice Homomorphism we have $\operatorname{id}_S$ is a semilattice homomorphism.
By Identity Mapping is Left Identity and Identity Mapping is Right Identity, this is the identity morphism for $\struct{S, \circ}$.

Finally by Composition of Mappings is Associative, the associative property is satisfied.

Hence $\mathbf{SLat}$ is a metacategory.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
A sequentially compact metric space is compact.


Proof
Follows directly from:

Sequentially Compact Space is Countably Compact
Countably Compact Metric Space is Compact
$\blacksquare$


Axiom of Countable Choice
This theorem depends on the Axiom of Countable Choice, by way of Countably Compact Metric Space is Compact.
Although not as strong as the Axiom of Choice, the Axiom of Countable Choice is similarly independent of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms.
As such, mathematicians are generally convinced of its truth and believe that it should be generally accepted.

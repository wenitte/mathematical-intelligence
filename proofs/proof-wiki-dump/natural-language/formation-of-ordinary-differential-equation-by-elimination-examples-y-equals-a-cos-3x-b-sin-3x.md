Examples of Formation of Ordinary Differential Equation by Elimination
Consider the equation:

$(1): \quad y = A \cos 3 x + B \sin 3 x$

This can be expressed as the ordinary differential equation of order $2$:

$\dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2} + 9 y = 0$


Proof
Differentiating twice with respect to $x$:














\(\ds \dfrac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -3 A \sin 3 x + 3 B \cos 3 x\)





Derivative of Cosine Function, Derivative of Sine Function








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -9 A \cos 3 x - 9 B \sin 3 x\)





Derivative of Cosine Function, Derivative of Sine Function














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -9 y\)





substituting from $(1)$



$\blacksquare$

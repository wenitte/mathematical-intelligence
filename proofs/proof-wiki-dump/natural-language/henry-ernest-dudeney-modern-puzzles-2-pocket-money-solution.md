Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $2$
Pocket-money
I went down the street with a certain amount of money in my pocket,
and when I returned home I discovered that I had spent just half of it,
and that I now had just as many shillings as I previously had pounds,
and half as many pounds as I then had shillings.
How much money had I spent?


Solution
The amount spent was $\pounds 9 \ 19 \shillings$


Proof
Let $S$ be the amount I started with: $S_L$ pounds and $S_s$ shillings.
Let $F$ be the amount I finished with: $F_L$ pounds and $F_s$ shillings.
We have that:

$2 F = S$
and so the amount spent is equal to $2 F - F = F$, that is, the amount I finished with.

We recall the conversion factors:

$20$ shillings make one pound.
Hence any shilling quantities in either $S$ or $F$ cannot be greater than $19$.
That is:

$S_s < 20$
$F_s < 20$
It is assumed that $S_s$ and $F_s$ are both integers, that is: both $S$ and $F$ are a whole number of shillings.

We are given that:














\(\ds S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 F\)





... and when I returned home I discovered that I had spent just half of it,














\(\ds F_s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds S_L\)





and that I now had just as many shillings as I previously had pounds,














\(\ds 2 F_L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds S_s\)





and half as many pounds as I then had shillings.



We have that:














\(\ds S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20 S_L + S_s\)





where $S$ shillings is the money I started out with














\(\ds F\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20 F_L + F_s\)





where $F$ shillings is the money I came home with














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20 \dfrac {S_s} 2 + S_L\)





as $2 F_L = S_s$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10 S_s + S_L\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 20 S_L + S_s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \paren {10 S_s + S_L}\)





as $2 F = S$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 18 S_L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 19 S_s\)





simplifying




The smallest values of $S_L$ and $S_s$ that satisfy the above equation are:














\(\ds S_L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 19\)




















\(\ds S_s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 18\)









As $S_s \le 19$ it follows that there can be no other solution.
Hence:














\(\ds F\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\pounds 19 \ 18 \shillings} 2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \pounds 9 \ 19 \shillings\)









which is equal to the amount spent.
$\blacksquare$

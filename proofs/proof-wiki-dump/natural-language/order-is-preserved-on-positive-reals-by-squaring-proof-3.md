Theorem
$x < y \iff x^2 < y^2$


Proof
From Real Numbers form Totally Ordered Field, the real numbers form a totally ordered field.
By definition, a totally ordered field is a totally ordered ring without proper zero divisors.
The result follows from Order of Squares in Totally Ordered Ring without Proper Zero Divisors.
$\blacksquare$

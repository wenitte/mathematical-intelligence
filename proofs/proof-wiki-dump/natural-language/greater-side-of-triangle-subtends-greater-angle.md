Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

In any triangle, the greater side subtends the greater angle.
(The Elements: Book $\text{I}$: Proposition $18$)


Proof

Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle such that $AC$ is greater than $AB$.
Let $AD$ be made equal to $AB$.
Let $BD$ be joined.
Then $\angle ADB$ is an exterior angle of the triangle $\triangle BCD$.
Therefore $\angle ADB$ is greater than $\angle ACB$.
As $AD = AB$, the triangle $\triangle ABD$ is isosceles.
From Isosceles Triangle has Two Equal Angles, $\angle ADB = \angle ABD$.
Therefore $\angle ABD$ is greater than $\angle ACB$.
Therefore, as $\angle ABC = \angle ABD + \angle DBC$, it follows that $\angle ABC$ is greater than $\angle ACB$.

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $18$ of Book $\text{I}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $19$: Greater Angle of Triangle Subtended by Greater Side.

Example of Primitive Semiperfect Number
$1190$ is a primitive semiperfect number:

$1 + 2 + 5 + 10 + 14 + 17 + 34 + 70 + 85 + 119 + 238 + 595 = 1190$


Proof
First it is demonstrated that $1190$ is semiperfect.
The aliquot parts of $1190$ are enumerated at $\sigma_0$ of $1190$:

$1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 17, 34, 35, 70, 85, 119, 170, 238, 595$
$1190$ is the sum of a subset of its aliquot parts:

$1 + 2 + 5 + 10 + 14 + 17 + 34 + 70 + 85 + 119 + 238 + 595$
Thus $1190$ is semiperfect by definition.

By inspecting the divisor sums of each of those aliquot parts, they are seen to be deficient except for $70$.
By Semiperfect Number is not Deficient, none of the deficient aliquot parts are themselves semiperfect.
As for $70$ itself, it is seen to be a weird number.
So, by definition, $70$ is not semiperfect.
Hence the result, by definition of primitive semiperfect number.

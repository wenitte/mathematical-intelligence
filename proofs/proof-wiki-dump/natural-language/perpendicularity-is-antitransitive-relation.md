Theorem
Let $S$ be the set of straight lines in the plane.
For $l_1, l_2 \in S$, let $l_1 \perp l_2$ denote that $l_1$ is perpendicular to $l_2$.

Then $\perp$ is an antitransitive relation on $S$.


Proof
Let $l_1 \perp l_2$ and $l_2 \perp l_3$.
Then $l_1$ and $l_3$ are parallel, and not perpendicular.
Thus $\perp$ is seen to be antitransitive.
$\blacksquare$

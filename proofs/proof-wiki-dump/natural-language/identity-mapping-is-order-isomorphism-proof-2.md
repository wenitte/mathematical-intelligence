Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
The identity mapping $I_S$ is an order isomorphism from $\struct {S, \preceq}$ to itself.


Proof
An ordered set is a relational structure where order isomorphism is a special case of relation isomorphism.
The result follows directly from Identity Mapping is Relation Isomorphism.

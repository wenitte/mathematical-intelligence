Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a partition topological space.
Then each of its open sets are components of $T$.


Proof
Let the partition $\PP$ be a basis of $T$.
From Open Set in Partition Topology is also Closed, open sets are in fact clopen.
So the elements of $\PP$ are clopen.
The result follows from the definition of components.

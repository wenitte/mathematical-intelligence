Theorem
Let $E / F$ be an algebraic field extension.

Then the relative separable closure $K = F^{sep}$ in $E$ is the unique intermediate field with the following properties:

$K / F$ is separable
$E / K$ is purely inseparable.


Proof
Let $K = F^{sep}$ be the set of elements of $E$ which are separable over $F$.
This is a subextension by Separable Elements Form Field.
Then elements of $E \setminus K$ are not separable over $F$, since all elements that are separable over $F$ are in $K$.
Then elements of $E \setminus K$ are not separable over $K$, since if an element of $E$ is separable over $K$, then it is separable over $F$, by Transitivity of Separable Field Extensions.
By definition of purely inseparable field extension, $E/K$ is purely inseparable.
$\blacksquare$

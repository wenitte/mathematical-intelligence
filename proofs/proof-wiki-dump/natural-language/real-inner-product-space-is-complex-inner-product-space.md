Theorem
Let $\struct{V, \innerprod \cdot \cdot}$ be a real inner product space.

Then $\struct{V, \innerprod \cdot \cdot}$ is a complex inner product Space.

Proof
This follows immediately from:

Definition of Real Inner Product Space
Definition of Complex Inner Product Space
Real Inner Product is Complex Inner Product
$\blacksquare$

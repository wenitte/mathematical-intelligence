Corollary to Euclid's Theorem
There is no largest prime number.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose there exists a largest prime number $p$.
Let $b = p! + 1$.
Let $q$ be a prime number that divides $b$.
Since $p$ is the largest prime number, $q \le p$.
However, no positive integer $d \le p$ is a divisor of $b$.
Hence $q \not \le p$.

Hence the result, by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

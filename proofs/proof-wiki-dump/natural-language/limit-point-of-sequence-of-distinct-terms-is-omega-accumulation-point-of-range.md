Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a sequence of distinct terms of $S$.
Let $\alpha$ be a limit point of $\sequence {x_n}$.

Then $\alpha$ is also an $\omega$-accumulation point of $\set {x_n: n \in \N}$.


Proof
Let $\alpha$ be an limit point of $\sequence {x_n}$.
From Limit of Sequence is Accumulation Point‎, $\alpha$ is an accumulation point of $\sequence {x_n}$.
From Accumulation Point of Sequence of Distinct Terms is Omega-Accumulation Point of Range, $\alpha$ is an $\omega$-accumulation point of $\set {x_n: n \in \N}$.
$\blacksquare$

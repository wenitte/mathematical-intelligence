Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If two incommensurable magnitudes be added together, the whole will also be incommensurable with one of them; and, if the whole be incommensurable with one of them, the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $16$)


Proof
Let $AB$ and $BC$ be incommensurable magnitudes which are added together to make $AC$.
Suppose $AC$ and $AB$ are not incommensurable.
Then some magnitude $D$ will measure them both.
Since $D$ measures both $AC$ and $AB$, $D$ also measures the remainder $BC$.
That is, $D$ measures $AB$ and $BC$.
Therefore from Book $\text{X}$ Definition $1$: Commensurable, $AB$ and $BC$ are commensurable.
But by hypothesis $AB$ and $BC$ are incommensurable.
Therefore no magnitude $D$ will measure both $AC$ and $AB$.
Therefore $AC$ and $AB$ are incommensurable.

In the same way it is shown that $AC$ and $BC$  are also incommensurable.
$\Box$

Now let $AC$ be incommensurable with one of either $AB$ and $BC$.
Without loss of generality, let $AC$ be incommensurable $AB$.
Suppose $AB$ and $BC$ are not incommensurable.
Then some magnitude $D$ will measure them both.
Since $D$ measures both $AB$ and $BC$, $D$ also measures the whole $AC$.
But $D$ measures $AB$.
Therefore $D$ measures both $AC$ and $AB$.
Therefore $AC$ and $AB$ are commensurable.
But by hypothesis $AB$ and $AC$ are incommensurable.
Therefore no magnitude will measure both $AB$ and $BC$.
Therefore $AB$ and $BC$ are incommensurable.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $16$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

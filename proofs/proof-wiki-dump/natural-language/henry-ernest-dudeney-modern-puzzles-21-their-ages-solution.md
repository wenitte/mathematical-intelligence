Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $21$
Their Ages
If you add the square of Tom's age to the age of Mary,
the sum is $62$;
but if you add the square of Mary's age to the age of Tom,
the result is $176$.
Can you say what are the ages of Tom and Mary?


Solution
Tom is $7$ and Mary is $13$.


Proof
Let $T$ be the age of Tom and $M$ be the age of Mary.
Expressing one variable in terms of another and eliminating one of them results in a quartic:














\(\ds T^2 + M\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 62\)




















\(\ds M^2 + T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 176\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds M\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 62 - T^2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {62 - T^2}^2 + T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 176\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds T^4 - 124 T^2 + T + 62^2 - 176\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)









Good luck with that.

So, let us assume that both $T$ and $M$ are natural numbers.

It is apparent that $T < 8$ and $M < 14$, otherwise the totals will be such that either $T$ or $M$ will be negative.
So:

$176 - M^2 < 8$
which leads us to:

$M^2 = 169$
giving us:

$M = 13$
and:

$T = 176 - 169 = 7$
We check the other equation:

$7^2 + 13 = 49 + 13 = 62$
and all is well.
$\blacksquare$

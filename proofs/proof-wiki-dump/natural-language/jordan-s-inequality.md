Theorem
  
$\dfrac {2 x} \pi \le \sin x \le x$
for all $x$ in the interval $\closedint 0 {\dfrac \pi 2}$


Proof
The right hand side inequality is true by Sine Inequality.
The left hand side inequality is true for $x = 0$ and $x = \dfrac \pi 2$, where we have equality.
Now consider $x \in \openint 0 {\dfrac \pi 2}$.
From Shape of Sine Function, $\sin x$ is concave on the interval $\closedint 0 \pi$.
Letting $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = x$ and $x_3 = \dfrac \pi 2$ in the definition of Concave Real Function we obtain:

$\dfrac {\sin x} x \ge \dfrac {1 - \sin x} {\dfrac \pi 2 - x}$
Rearranging gives the desired inequality.
$\blacksquare$

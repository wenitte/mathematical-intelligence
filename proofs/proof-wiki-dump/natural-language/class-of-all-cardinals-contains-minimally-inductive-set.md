Theorem
Let $\NN$ denote the class of all cardinal numbers.

Then:

$\omega \subseteq \NN$
where $\omega$ denotes the minimally inductive set.


Proof
Suppose $n \in \omega$.
By Cardinal of Finite Ordinal, $n = \card n$.
By Cardinal of Cardinal Equal to Cardinal/Corollary, $n \in \NN$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $Q = \set {q_1, q_2, \ldots}$ be a set of point charges.
Let $S$ be a closed surface surrounding $Q$.
The total electric flux through $S$ is given by:

$\ds F = \dfrac 1 {\varepsilon_0} \sum_Q q_i$


Proof
From Electric Flux out of Closed Surface surrounding Point Charge:

$F_i = \dfrac {q_i} {\varepsilon_0}$
where $F_i$ is the part of $F$ brought about by $q_i$.
The result follows from Electric Field satisfies Principle of Superposition.
$\blacksquare$

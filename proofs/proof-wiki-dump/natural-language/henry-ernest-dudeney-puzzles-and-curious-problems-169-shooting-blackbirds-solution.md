Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $169$
Shooting Blackbirds
Twice four and twenty blackbirds
Were sitting in the rain;
I shot and killed a seventh part,
How many did remain?


Solution
$4$.


Proof
The reader is initially tempted into thinking of:

Twice four and twenty
as meaning:

$2 \times 24$
and then is left scratching one's head at the absurdity of finding an integer solution to $x = \dfrac {48} 7$.
In fact:

Twice four and twenty
is interpreted as:

$\paren {2 \times 4} + 20$
which gives $28$.
Hence $\dfrac {28} 4 = 4$ were shot, leaving $24$ remaining.

But no! This is a trick puzzle.
The $24$ which were not shot flew away, leaving $4$ (dead) blackbirds remaining.
I hope Dudeney was pleased with himself.
$\blacksquare$

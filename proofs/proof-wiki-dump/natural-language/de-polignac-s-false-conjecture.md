Famous False Conjecture
Every odd number greater than $1$ can be expressed as the sum of a power of $2$ and a prime.


Investigation
It is seen by direct investigation that the first few integers support the conjecture.


Refutation
The smallest integer for which this conjecture fails is $127$:














\(\ds 127 - 2^0\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds 126 \, \)

\(\, \ds = \, \)



\(\ds 2 \times 3^2 \times 7\)





not prime














\(\ds 127 - 2^1\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds 125 \, \)

\(\, \ds = \, \)



\(\ds 5^3\)





not prime














\(\ds 127 - 2^2\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds 123 \, \)

\(\, \ds = \, \)



\(\ds 3 \times 41\)





not prime














\(\ds 127 - 2^3\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds 119 \, \)

\(\, \ds = \, \)



\(\ds 7 \times 17\)





not prime














\(\ds 127 - 2^4\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds 111 \, \)

\(\, \ds = \, \)



\(\ds 3 \times 37\)





not prime














\(\ds 127 - 2^5\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds 95 \, \)

\(\, \ds = \, \)



\(\ds 5 \times 19\)





not prime














\(\ds 127 - 2^6\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds 63 \, \)

\(\, \ds = \, \)



\(\ds 3^2 \times 7\)





not prime














\(\ds 127 - 2^7\)

\(=\)

\(\, \ds -1 \, \)





\(\ds \)





and we have fallen off the end

Historical Note
Alphonse de Polignac proposed his false conjecture in $1848$, claiming that he had verified it up to $3$ million.
This was clearly an exaggeration, as the conjecture fails for the modestly small number $127$.

David Wells, in his Curious and Interesting Numbers of $1986$, mentions that this topic is discussed by Nigel Boston in Quarch, no. $6$.
This needs to be corroborated.

Theorem
Let the notation $\paren {abc}_n$ be interpreted to mean $n$ consecutive repetitions of a string of digits $abc$ concatenated in the decimal representation of an integer.

The integer:

$\paren {10987654321234567890}_{42} 1$
has the following properties:

it is a palindromic prime with $841$ digits
its digits are alternately odd and even.


Proof
It was checked that it is a prime number using the "Alpertron" Integer factorisation calculator on $22$nd March $2022$.
This took approximately $0.4$ seconds.
This number has $20 \times 42 + 1 = 841$ digits.
The remaining properties of this number is obvious by inspection.
$\blacksquare$

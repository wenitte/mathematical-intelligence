Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \cdot}$ be a group whose identity is $e$.
Let $\map {\MM_G} {m, n}$ be a $m \times n$ matrix space over $\struct {G, \cdot}$.
Then $\struct {\map {\MM_G} {m, n}, \circ}$, where $\circ$ is Hadamard product, is also a group.


Proof
As $\struct {G, \cdot}$, being a group, is a monoid, it follows from Matrix Space Semigroup under Hadamard Product that $\struct {\map {\MM_G} {m, n}, \circ}$ is also a monoid.
As $\struct {G, \cdot}$ is a group, it follows from Negative Matrix is Inverse for Hadamard Product that all elements of $\struct {\map {\MM_G} {m, n}, \circ}$ have an inverse.
The result follows.

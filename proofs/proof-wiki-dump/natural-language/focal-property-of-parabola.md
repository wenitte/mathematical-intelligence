Theorem
Let $\KK$ be a parabola whose focus is at $F$ and whose directrix is $D$.
Let $P$ be an arbitrary point on $\KK$.

The tangent to $\KK$ at $P$ bisects the angle between the straight line $PF$ and the straight line through $P$ perpendicular to $D$. 





Proof


Let $BQ$ be the straight line constructed perpendicular to $D$ passing through $P$.
Let $AT$ be the tangent to $\KK$ at $P$.
Let $\angle APF$ be constructed equal to $\angle BPT$ where $F$ is on the axis of $\KK$.
It is to be shown that $F$ is the focus of $\KK$.

From Two Straight Lines make Equal Opposite Angles:

$\angle BPT = \angle APQ$
and so as $\angle APF = \angle BPT$ by construction:

$\angle APQ = \angle APF$

Consider the two triangles $\triangle APQ$ and $\triangle APF$.
We have that:

$AP$ is common
$\angle APQ = \angle APF$
From Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence $\triangle APQ$ and $\triangle APF$ will be congruent if and only if $PF = PQ$.
From the focus-directrix property of parabola $P$ is on the locus of the points that are equidistant from $F$ and $D$.
Hence the point $F$ is the focus.

The validity of the material on this page is questionable.In particular: We assume the congruence of $\triangle APQ$ and $\triangle APF$, and from that assumption deduce that $F$ must be the focus. But we have not proven that $\triangle APQ$ and $\triangle APF$ are congruent, and we cannot therefore deduce that $PF = PQ$ and therefore that $F$ is the focus of $\KK$.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by resolving the issues.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Questionable}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

The focal property of a parabola is also known as the reflection property.
In the context of physics, it is also called the optical property or acoustical property

Example of Invalid Argument
The following is an valid argument with true premises and a false conclusion:

If Nelson Rockefeller was President then he was famous.
Nelson Rockefeller was not President.
Therefore Nelson Rockefeller was not famous.

This is an example of Denying the Antecedent.
It is true that being President makes you famous, and it is also true that Nelson Rockefeller was not President.
However, it is not true that not being President makes you not famous.
$\blacksquare$

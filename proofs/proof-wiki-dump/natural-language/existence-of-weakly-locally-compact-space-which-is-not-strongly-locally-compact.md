Theorem
There exists at least one example of a weakly locally compact topological space which is not also a strongly locally compact space.


Proof 1
Let $T$ be the nested interval topological space.

From Nested Interval Topology is Weakly Locally Compact, $T$ is a weakly locally compact space.
From Nested Interval Topology is not Strongly Locally Compact, $T$ is not a strongly locally compact space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Let $T$ be an infinite particular point space.

From Particular Point Space is Weakly Locally Compact, $T$ is a weakly locally compact space.
From Infinite Particular Point Space is not Strongly Locally Compact, $T$ is not a strongly locally compact space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

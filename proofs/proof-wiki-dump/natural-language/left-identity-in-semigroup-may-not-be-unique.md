Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a semigroup.
Let $e_L$ be a left identity of $\struct {S, \circ}$.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $e_L$ is unique.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample
Let $\struct {S, \gets}$ be an algebraic structure in which the operation $\to$ is the right operation.
From Structure under Right Operation is Semigroup, $\struct {S, \to}$ is a semigroup.
From Element under Right Operation is Left Identity, every element of $\struct {S, \to}$ is a left identity.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

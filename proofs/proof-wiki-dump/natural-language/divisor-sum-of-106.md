Example of Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime
$\map {\sigma_1} {106} = 162$
where $\sigma_1$ denotes the divisor sum function.


Proof
We have that:

$106 = 2 \times 53$
and so by definition is a semiprime whose prime factors are distinct.

Hence:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {106}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2 + 1} \paren {53 + 1}\)





Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 54\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 162\)

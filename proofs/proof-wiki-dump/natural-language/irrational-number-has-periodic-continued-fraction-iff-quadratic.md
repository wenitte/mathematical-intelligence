Theorem
Let $x$ be an irrational number.
Then $x$ is a quadratic irrational if and only if its continued fraction expansion is periodic.


Proof
Follows from:

Limit of Simple Infinite Periodic Continued Fraction is Quadratic Irrational
Quadratic Irrational has Periodic Continued Fraction Expansion
$\blacksquare$

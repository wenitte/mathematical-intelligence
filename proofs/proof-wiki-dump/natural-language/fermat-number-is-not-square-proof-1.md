Theorem
There exist no Fermat numbers which are square.


Proof
Let $n = 0$.
Then $F_0 = 2^{2^0} + 1 = 3$ is not a square.

Let $n \ge 1$.
Then:














\(\ds F_n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2^{\left({2^n}\right)} + 1\)





Definition of Fermat Number














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \left({2^{\left({2^{n-1} }\right)} }\right)^2 + 1\)





... and so $1$ more than a square



Thus by Zero and One are the only Consecutive Perfect Squares, $2^{\left({2^n}\right)} + 1$ is not square.

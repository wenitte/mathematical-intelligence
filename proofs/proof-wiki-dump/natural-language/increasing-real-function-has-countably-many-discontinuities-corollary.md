Corollary
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be an increasing real function.
Let $D$ be the set of discontinuities of $f$. 

Then $\R \setminus D$ is everywhere dense in $\R$. 


Proof
From Increasing Real Function has Countably Many Discontinuities, $D$ is countable.
From Complement of Countable Set in Topological Space where Open Neighborhood is Uncountable is Everywhere Dense: Corollary, $\R \setminus D$ is everywhere dense in $\R$. 
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$\vdash \left({\neg p \implies p}\right) \implies  p$


Proof
We apply the Method of Truth Tables.
As can be seen by inspection, the truth value under the main connective is true for all boolean interpretations.

$\begin{array}{|cccc|c|c|} \hline
(\neg & p & \implies & p) & \implies & p \\
\hline
\T & \F & \F & \F & \T & \F \\
\F & \T & \T & \T & \T & \T \\
\hline
\end{array}$
$\blacksquare$

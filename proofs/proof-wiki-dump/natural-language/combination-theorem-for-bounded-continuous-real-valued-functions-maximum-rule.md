Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $f, g :S \to \R$ be bounded continuous real-valued functions.
Let $f \vee g$ denote the pointwise maximum of $f$ and $g$, that is, $f \vee g$ is the mapping defined by:

$\forall s \in SÂ : \map {\paren{f \vee g} } s = \max \set{\map f s, \map g s}$

Then:

$f \vee g$ is a bounded continuous real-valued function


Proof
Follows from:

Maximum Rule for Bounded Real-Valued Functions
Maximum Rule for Continuous Real-Valued Functions

Corollary to Deleted Integer Topology is Second-Countable
Let $S = \R_{\ge 0} \setminus \Z$.
Let $\tau$ be the deleted integer topology on $S$.

The topological space $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ is Lindelöf.


Proof
From Deleted Integer Topology is Second-Countable, $T$ is second-countable.
The result follows from Second-Countable Space is Lindelöf.
$\blacksquare$

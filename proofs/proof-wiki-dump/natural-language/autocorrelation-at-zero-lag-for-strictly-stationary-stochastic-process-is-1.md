Example of Strictly Stationary Stochastic Process
Let $S$ be a strictly stationary stochastic process giving rise to a time series $T$.
Then the autocorrelation at zero lag is given by:

$\rho_0 = 1$


Proof
From Autocorrelation of Strictly Stationary Stochastic Process:

$\rho_k = \dfrac {\gamma_k} {\gamma_0}$
where $\gamma_k$ denotes the autocovariance of $S$.

For zero lag, $k = 0$.
Hence:

$\rho_0 = \dfrac {\gamma_0} {\gamma_0} = 1$
$\blacksquare$

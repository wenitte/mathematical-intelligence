Theorem
Let $M$ be a set.
Let $\bigcup M \in M$.
Let $(M, \subseteq)$ be the ordered set formed on $M$ by the subset relation (see Subset Relation is Ordering).

Then $\bigcup M$ is the greatest set by set inclusion ($M$ corresponds to $\TT$) of $(M, \subseteq)$.

Proof
By Set is Subset of Union:

$\forall \paren {N \in M}: N \subseteq \bigcup M$.

Therefore, $\bigcup M$ is the greatest element under the subset relation.
$\blacksquare$

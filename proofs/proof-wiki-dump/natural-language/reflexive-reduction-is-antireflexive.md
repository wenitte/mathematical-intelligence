Theorem
Let $\RR$ be a relation on a set $S$.
Let $\RR^\ne$ denote the reflexive reduction of $\RR$.

Then $\RR^\ne$ is antireflexive.


Proof
By the definition of reflexive reduction:

$\RR^\ne = \RR \setminus \Delta_S$
where $\Delta_S$ denotes the diagonal relation on $S$.
By Set Difference Intersection with Second Set is Empty Set:

$\paren {\RR \setminus \Delta_S} \cap \Delta_S = \O$
Hence by Relation is Antireflexive iff Disjoint from Diagonal Relation, $\RR^\ne$ is antireflexive.
$\blacksquare$

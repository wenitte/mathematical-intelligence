Corollary to Dirichlet's Box Principle
If a set of $n$ distinct objects is partitioned into $k$ subsets, where $0 < k < n$, then at least one subset must contain at least two elements.


Proof
A direct application of the Dirichlet's Box Principle.

Also known as
Dirichlet's Box Principle, in particular its corollary, is also commonly known as the Pigeonhole Principle or Pigeon-Hole Principle:

Suppose you have $n + 1$ pigeons, but have only $n$ holes for them to stay in.
By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of the holes houses $2$ pigeons.
It is also known as Dirichlet's Drawer Principle or Dirichlet's Shelf Principle.
Some sources give it as the Letterbox Principle or Letter-Box Principle.

Some sources call it Dirichlet's Principle, but there is more than one theorem named such.
Some sources give this as the Dirichlet Principle.

Theorem
There exists at least one example of a topological space which is a completely Hausdorff space, but is not also a regular space.


Proof
Let $T$ be a half-disc space.

From Half-Disc Space is Completely Hausdorff, $T$ is a completely Hausdorff space.
From Half-Disc Space is not Regular, $T$ is not a regular space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

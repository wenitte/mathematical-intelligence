Example of Problem from Chiu Chang Suann Jing
Suppose that there are a number of rabbits and pheasants confined in a cage,
in all thirty-five heads and ninety-four feet;
required the number of each?


Solution
There are $12$ rabbits and $23$ pheasants.


Proof
Let $r$ be the number of rabbits.
Let $p$ be the number of pheasants.
It is assumed that the rabbits all have $4$ feet and the pheasants $2$.
Then:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds r + p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 35\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 4 r + 2 p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 94\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 r + 2 p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 70\)





$(1) \times 2$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 24\)





$(2) - (3)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 35 - 12\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 23\)









$\blacksquare$

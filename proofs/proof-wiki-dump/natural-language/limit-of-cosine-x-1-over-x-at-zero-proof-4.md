Theorem
$\ds \lim_{x \mathop \to 0} \frac {\cos x - 1} x = 0$


Proof













\(\ds \frac {\cos x - 1} x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\cos x - \cos 0} x\)





Cosine of Zero is One














\(\ds \)

\(\to\)







\(\ds \valueat {\dfrac \d {\d x} \cos x} {x \mathop = 0}\)





as $x \to 0$, from Definition of Derivative of Real Function at Point














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \bigvalueat {\sin x} {x \mathop = 0}\)





Derivative of Cosine Function














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





Sine of Zero is Zero

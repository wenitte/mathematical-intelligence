Theorem
Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$.

Then the expectation of $X$ is given by:

$\expect X = p$


Proof
From the definition of expectation:

$\ds \expect X = \sum_{x \mathop \in \Img X} x \map \Pr {X = x}$
By definition of Bernoulli distribution:

$\expect X = 1 \times p + 0 \times \paren {1 - p}$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

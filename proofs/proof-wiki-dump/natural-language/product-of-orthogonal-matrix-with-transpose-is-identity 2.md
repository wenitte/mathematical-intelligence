Theorem
Let $\mathbf Q$ be an orthogonal matrix.
Then:

$\mathbf Q \mathbf Q^\intercal = \mathbf I = \mathbf Q^\intercal \mathbf Q$
where:

$\mathbf Q^\intercal$ is the transpose of $\mathbf Q$
$\mathbf I$ is a unit (identity) matrix


Proof
By definition, an orthogonal matrix is one such that:

$\mathbf Q^\intercal = \mathbf Q^{-1}$
and so the result follows by definition of inverse.

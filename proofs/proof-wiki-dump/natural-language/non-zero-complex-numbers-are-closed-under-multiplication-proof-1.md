Theorem
The set of non-zero complex numbers is closed under multiplication.


Proof
Recall that Complex Numbers form Field under the operations of addition and multiplication.
By definition of a field, the algebraic structure $\struct {\C_{\ne 0}, \times}$ is a group.
Thus, by definition, $\times$ is closed in $\struct {\C_{\ne 0}, \times}$.

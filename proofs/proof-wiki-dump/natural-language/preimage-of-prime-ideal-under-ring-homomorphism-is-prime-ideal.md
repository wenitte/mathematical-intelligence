Theorem
Let $A$ and $B$ be commutative rings with unity.
Let $fÂ : A \to B$ be a ring homomorphism.
Let $\mathfrak p \subseteq B$ be a prime ideal.

Then its preimage $\map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak p}$ is a prime ideal of $A$.


Proof 1
By Preimage of Ideal under Ring Homomorphism is Ideal, $\map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak p}$ is a ideal of $A$.
Let $a, b \in A$ with $a b \in \map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak p}$.
By definitin of preimage, $\map f a \, \map f b = \map f {a b} \in \mathfrak p$.
Because $\mathfrak p$ is prime, $\map f a \in \mathfrak p$ or $\map f b \in \mathfrak p$.
Thus $a \in \map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak p}$ or $b \in \map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak p}$.
Thus $\map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak p}$ is a prime ideal.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
By Preimage of Ideal under Ring Homomorphism is Ideal, $\map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak p}$ is a ideal of $A$.
Let $B / \mathfrak p$ be the quotient ring.
By Prime Ideal iff Quotient Ring is Integral Domain, $B / \mathfrak p$ is an integral domain.
By Kernel of Quotient Ring Epimorhpism, the quotient ring epimorphism $B \to B / \mathfrak p$ has kernel $\mathfrak p$.
By Kernel of Composition of Ring Homomorphisms, the composition $A \overset f \to B \to B / \mathfrak p$ has kernel $\map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak p}$.
By Universal Property of Quotient Ring, there exists a ring homomorphism $A / \map {f^{-1} } {\mathfrak p} \to B / \mathfrak p$.

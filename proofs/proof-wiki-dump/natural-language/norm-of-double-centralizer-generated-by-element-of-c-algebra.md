Theorem
Let $\struct {A, \ast, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a $\text C^\ast$-algebra.
Let $c \in A$.
Let $\tuple {L_c, R_c}$ be the double centralizer generated by $c$.

Then:

$\norm {L_c}_{\map B A} = \norm {R_c}_{\map B A} = \norm c$
where $\norm {L_c}_{\map B A}$ and $\norm {R_c}_{\map B A}$ denotes the norm of a bounded linear transformation.


Proof
From Norm of Element of C*-Algebra as Supremum over Closed Unit Ball we have:

$\ds \norm c = \sup_{\norm b \le 1} \norm {c b} = \sup_{\norm b \le 1} \norm {b c}$
From the definition of the double centralizer generated by $c$, we have:

$\ds \norm c = \sup_{\norm b \le 1} \norm {\map {L_c} b} = \sup_{\norm b \le 1} \norm {\map {R_c} b}$
By the definition of the norm of a bounded linear transformation, we then have:

$\norm c = \norm {L_c}_{\map B A} = \norm {R_c}_{\map B A}$
$\blacksquare$

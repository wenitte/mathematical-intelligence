Theorem
Let $\struct {X, d}$ be a compact metric space.
Then $\struct {X, d}$ is separable.


Proof
From Compactness and Sequential Compactness are Equivalent in Metric Spaces, $\struct {X, d}$ is sequentially compact. 
From Sequentially Compact Metric Space is Separable, $\struct {X, d}$ is separable.
$\blacksquare$

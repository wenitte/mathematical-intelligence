Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $323$
Cats and Mice
A number of cats (more than one) killed between them $999 \, 919$ mice, and every cat killed an equal number of mice (more than one).
Each cat killed more mice than there were cats.
How many cats were there?


Solution
$991$ cats.


Proof
$999 \, 919$ is a semiprime whose proper divisors are $991$ and $1009$.
$\blacksquare$

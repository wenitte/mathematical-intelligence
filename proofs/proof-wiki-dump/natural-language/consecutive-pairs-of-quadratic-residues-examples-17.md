Examples of Consecutive Pairs of Quadratic Residues
There are $4$ consecutive pairs of quadratic residues modulo $17$.
This is consistent with the number of such consecutive pairs being $\floor {\dfrac {17} 4}$.


Proof
From Quadratic Residues modulo $17$:

$\set {1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16}$ are the quadratic residues modulo $17$
The set of pairs of consecutive quadratic residues modulo $17$ is therefore:

$\set {\set {1, 2}, \set {8, 9}, \set {15, 16}, \set {16, 1} }$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The following sets of $4$ consecutive triplets of integers, with one integer between each triplet, are square-free:

$29, 30, 31; 33, 34, 35; 37, 38, 39; 41, 42, 43$
$101, 102, 103; 105, 106, 107; 109, 110, 111; 113, 114, 115$


Proof
Note that $32, 36, 40$ and $104, 108, 112$ are all divisible by $4 = 2^2$, so are by definition not square-free.

Then inspecting each number in turn:

\(\ds \)





is prime














\(\ds 30\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times 3 \times 5\)





and so is square-free

\(\ds \)





is prime


















\(\ds 33\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 11\)





and so is square-free

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times 17\)





and so is square-free

and so is square-free

Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If a number by multiplying two numbers make certain numbers, the numbers so produced will have the same ratio as the numbers multiplied.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VII}$: Proposition $17$)


Proof
Let the number $A$ by multiplying the two numbers $B, C$ to make $D, E$.
We need to show that:

$B : C = D : E$

We have that:

$A \times B = D$
Therefore $B$ measures $D$ according to the units in $A$.
But the unit $F$ also measures $A$ according to the units in it.
Therefore $F$ measures $A$ the same number of times that $B$ measures $D$.
So from Book $\text{VII}$ Definition $20$: Proportional:

$F : A = B : D$
For the same reason:

$F : A = C : E$
Therefore also:

$B : D = C : E$
So from Proposition $13$ of Book $\text{VII} $: Proportional Numbers are Proportional Alternately:

$B : C = D : E$
$\blacksquare$


Examples
Arbitrary Example
We have:

$12 : 15$ is the same ratio as $4 : 5$, and also the same ratio as $24 : 30$.


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{VII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Theorem
Let $\tuple {\C, d}$ be the complex Euclidean space.
Consider $S \subseteq \R$ as a topological subspace of $\tuple {\C, d}$.

Then the interior of $S$ in $\C$ is the empty set $\O$.


Proof
From Interior of Subset we have:

$S^\circ \subseteq \R^\circ$
From Interior of Set of Real Numbers in Complex Numbers is Empty, we have:

$\R^\circ = \O$
Hence $S^\circ \subseteq \O$ and so:

$S^\circ = \O$
from Subset of Empty Set.
$\blacksquare$

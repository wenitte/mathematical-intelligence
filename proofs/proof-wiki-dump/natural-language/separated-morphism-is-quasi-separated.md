Theorem
Let $f$ be a separated morphism of schemes.
Then $f$ is quasi-separated.


Proof
Let $f$ be a separated morphism of schemes.
By definition, the diagonal morphism $\Delta_f$ is a closed immersion.
By Closed Immersion is Quasi-Compact $\Delta_f$ is quasi-compact.
Thus, by definition, $f$ is quasi-separated.
$\blacksquare$

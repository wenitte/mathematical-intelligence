Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers.
Let $a$ be a $p$-adic number, that is left coset, in $\Q_p$.
Let $\ds \sum_{n \mathop = m}^\infty d_n p^n$ be a $p$-adic expansion.

Then:

$\ds \sum_{n \mathop = m}^\infty d_n p^n$ converges to $a$ if and only if $\ds \sum_{n \mathop = m}^\infty d_n p^n$ is a representative of $a$


Proof
By definition of a $p$-adic expansion:

$\ds \sum_{n \mathop = m}^\infty d_n p^n$ is a rational sequence.
The theorem follows from Rational Sequence Converges in P-adic Numbers iff Sequence Represents Limit.

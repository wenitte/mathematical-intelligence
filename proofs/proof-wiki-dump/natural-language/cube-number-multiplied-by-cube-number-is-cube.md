Theorem
Let $a, b \in \N$ be natural numbers.
Let $a$ and $b$ be cube numbers.

Then $a b$ is also a cube number.

In the words of Euclid:

If a cube number by multiplying a cube number make some number the product will be cube.
(The Elements: Book $\text{IX}$: Proposition $4$)


Proof
By the definition of cube number:

$\exists r \in \N: r^3 = a$
$\exists s \in \N: s^3 = b$
Thus:














\(\ds a b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {r^3} \paren {s^3}\)





Power of Product














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {r s}^3\)









Thus:

$\exists k = r s \in \N: a = k^3$
Hence the result by definition of cube number.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{IX}$ of Euclid's The Elements. The proof as given here is not that given by Euclid, as the latter is unwieldy and of limited use.

Theorem
Let $G$ be a group, and let $\iota: G \to G$ be the inversion mapping.

Then $\iota$ is an involution.
That is:

$\forall g \in G: \map \iota {\map \iota g} = g$


Proof
Let $g \in G$.
Then:














\(\ds \map \iota {\map \iota g}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {g^{-1} }^{-1}\)





Definition of Inversion Mapping














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds g\)

which establishes the result.

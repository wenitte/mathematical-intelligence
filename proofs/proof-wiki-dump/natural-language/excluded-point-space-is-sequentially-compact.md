Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_{\bar p} }$ be an excluded point space.

Then $T$ is a sequentially compact space.


Proof
Excluded Point Space is Compact
Compact Space is Countably Compact
Excluded Point Space is First-Countable
First-Countable Space is Sequentially Compact iff Countably Compact
$\blacksquare$

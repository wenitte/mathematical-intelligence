Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

A medial area does not exceed a medial area by a rational area.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $26$)


Proof
Let $\rho \cdot \sqrt k \rho$ and $\rho \cdot \sqrt \lambda \rho$ be two medial areas which have been applied to the same rational number $\rho$.
Their difference is then:

$\paren {\sqrt k - \sqrt \lambda} \rho^2$
Let $x = \sqrt k \rho$ and $y = \sqrt \lambda \rho$.
Let:

$\rho \paren {x - y} = \rho z$
Suppose $\rho z$ is a rational area.
Then $z$ must be a rational straight line and:

$(1): \quad z \frown \rho$
where $\frown$ denotes commensurability in length.
Since $\rho x$ and $\rho y$ are medial areas, it follows that $x$ and $y$ are rational and:

$(2): \quad x \smile \rho$ and $y \smile \rho$
where $\smile$ denotes incommensurability in length.
Then from $(1)$ and $(2)$:

$y \smile z$
Then:














\(\ds y : z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y^2 : y z\)




















\(\ds y^2\)

\(\smile\)







\(\ds y z\)









But:














\(\ds y^2 + z^2\)

\(\frown\)







\(\ds y^2\)




















\(\ds 2 y z\)

\(\frown\)







\(\ds y z\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y^2 + z^2\)

\(\smile\)







\(\ds 2 y z\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {y + z}^2\)

\(\smile\)







\(\ds \paren {y^2 + z^2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2\)

\(\smile\)







\(\ds \paren {y^2 + z^2}\)









But $y^2 + z^2$ is rational.
Therefore $x^2$ must be irrational.
Therefore $x$ must be irrational.
But from $(2)$ $x$ is rational.
The result follows from this contradiction.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $26$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Subgroups of the Quaternion Group
Let $Q$ denote the quaternion group, whose group presentation is given as:

$\Dic 2 = \gen {a, b: a^4 = e, b^2 = a^2, a b a = b}$

The subsets of $Q$ which form subgroups of $Q$ are:














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds Q\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set e\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, a^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, a, a^2, a^3}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, b, a^2, a^2 b}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, a b, a^2, a^3 b}\)










From Quaternion Group is Hamiltonian we have that all of these subgroups of $Q$ are normal.


Proof
Consider the Cayley table for $Q$:

$\begin {array} {r|rrrrrrrr}
& e     & a     & a^2   & a^3   & b     & a b   & a^2 b & a^3 b \\
\hline
e     & e     & a     & a^2   & a^3   & b     & a b   & a^2 b & a^3 b \\
a     & a     & a^2   & a^3   & e     & a b   & a^2 b & a^3 b & b     \\
a^2   & a^2   & a^3   & e     & a     & a^2 b & a^3 b & b     & a b   \\
a^3   & a^3   & e     & a     & a^2   & a^3 b & b     & a b   & a^2 b \\
b     & b     & a^3 b & a^2 b & a b   & a^2   & a     & e     & a^3   \\
a b   & a b   & b     & a^3 b & a^2 b & a^3   & a^2   & a     & e     \\
a^2 b & a^2 b & a b   & b     & a^3 b & e     & a^3   & a^2   & a     \\
a^3 b & a^3 b & a^2 b & a b   & b     & a     & e     & a^3   & a^2 
\end {array}$

We have that:

$a^4 = e$
and so $\gen a = \set {e, a, a^2, a^3}$ forms a subgroup of $Q$ which is cyclic.

We have that:

$b^2 = a^2$
and so $\gen b = \set {e, b, a^2, a^2 b}$ forms a subgroup of $Q$ which is cyclic.

We have that:

$\paren {a b}^2 = a^2$
and so $\gen {a b} = \set {e, a b, a^2, a^3 b}$ forms a subgroup of $Q$ which is cyclic.

We have that:

$\paren {a^2}^2 = e$
and so $\gen {a^2} = \set {e, a^2}$ forms a subgroup of $Q$ which is also a subgroup of $\gen a$, $\gen b$ and $\gen {a b}$.

That exhausts all elements of $Q$.
Any subgroup generated by any $2$ elements of $Q$ which are not both in the same subgroup as described above will generate the whole of $Q$.

Theorem
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number such that $x > 0$.
Let $n \in \Z$ be an integer such that $n < 0$.

Then there exists a $y \in \R: y \ge 0$ such that $y^n = x$.


Proof
Let $m = -n$.
Then $m > 0$.
Let $g$ be the real function defined on $\hointr 0 \to$ defined by:

$\map g y = y^m$
Since $x \ge 0$:

$\dfrac 1 x \ge 0$
By Existence of Positive Root of Positive Real Number: Positive Exponent there is a $y > 0$ such that:

$\map g y = \dfrac 1 x$
It follows from the definition of power that:














\(\ds \map f y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {\map g y}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {1 / x}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds x\)

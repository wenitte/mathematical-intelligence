Theorem
Let $S = \sequence {a_n}$ be a rational sequence.
Let $S$ be convergent to a limit $L$.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $L$ is itself a rational number.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample:
By definition, Euler's number $e$ can be defined as:

$e = \ds \sum_{n \mathop = 0}^\infty \frac 1 {n!}$
Each of the terms of the sequence of partial sums is rational.
However, from Euler's Number is Irrational, $e$ itself is not.
$\blacksquare$

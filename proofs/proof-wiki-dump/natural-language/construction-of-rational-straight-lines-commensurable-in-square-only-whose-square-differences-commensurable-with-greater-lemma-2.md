Lemma to Construction of Rational Straight Lines Commensurable in Square Only whose Square Differences Commensurable with Greater
In the words of Euclid:

To find two square numbers such that their sum is not square.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $29$ : Lemma 2)


Proof
Let $a$ and $b$ be square numbers such that $a > b$.
Let $c = a - b$ be even.
Let $d = \dfrac c 2$
From Lemma 1:

$a b + d^2 = \paren {a - d}^2$
Then:

$a b + \paren {d - 1}^2 < \paren {a - d}^2$

Suppose $a b + \paren {d - 1}^2$ were square.
Then either:

$a b + \paren {d - 1}^2 = \paren {a - d - 1}^2$
or:

$a b + \paren {d - 1}^2 < \paren {a - d - 1}^2$
It cannot be greater, without being equal to \paren {a - d}^2 because they are consecutive numbers.

Suppose:

$a b + \paren {d - 1}^2 = \paren {a - d - 1}^2$
Since $c = 2 d$ it follows that $c - 2 = 2 \paren {d - 1}$
Therefore from Square of Sum less Square:

$\paren {a - 2} b + \paren {d - 1}^2 = \paren {a - d - 1}^2$
But by hypothesis:

$a b + \paren {d - 1}^2 = \paren {a - d - 1}^2$
Therefore:

$\paren {a - 2} b + \paren {d - 1}^2 = a b + \paren {d - 1}^2$
Thus:

$\paren {a - 2} b = a b$
which is absurd.
Therefore $a b + \paren {d - 1}^2 \ne \paren {a - d - 1}^2$.

Suppose $a b + \paren {d - 1}^2 = f^2$ for some natural number $f$.
Let $h = 2 \paren {a - d - f}$.
It follows that:

$\paren {a - b - h} = 2 \paren {f - b}$
So from Square of Sum less Square:

$\paren {a - h} b + \paren {f - b}^2 = f^2$
But by hypothesis:

$a b + \paren {d - 1}^2 = f^2$
Thus:

$\paren {a - h} b + \paren {f - b}^2 = a b + \paren {d - 1}^2$
which is absurd.
Therefore:

$a b + \paren {d - 1}^2 \not < \paren {a - d - 1}^2$
Both possibilities have been shown not to be possible.
Hence $a b + \paren {d - 1}^2$ is not square.
Thus we have two square numbers whose sum is not square, as required.
$\blacksquare$

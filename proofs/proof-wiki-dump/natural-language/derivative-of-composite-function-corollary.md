Theorem
Let $f, g, h$ be continuous real functions such that:

$y = \map f u, x = \map g u$

Then:

$\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} = \dfrac {\paren {\dfrac {\d y} {\d u} } } {\paren {\dfrac {\d x} {\d u} } }$
for $\dfrac {\d x} {\d u} \ne 0$.


Proof













\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d x} \frac {\d x} {\d u}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d u}\)





Derivative of Composite Function








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\paren {\dfrac {\d y} {\d u} } } {\paren {\dfrac {\d x}{\d u} } }\)





dividing both sides by $\dfrac {\d x} {\d u}$



$\blacksquare$

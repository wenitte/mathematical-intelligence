Theorem
Every primitive recursive relation is URM computable.


Proof
This follows immediately from:

a relation is primitive recursive if its characteristic function is a primitive recursive
the fact that every Primitive Recursive Function is URM Computable.
$\blacksquare$


Note
This does not mean that every URM computable relation is necessarily primitive recursive.

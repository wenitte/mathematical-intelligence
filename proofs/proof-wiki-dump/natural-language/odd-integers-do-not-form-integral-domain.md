Theorem
Let $S$ denote the set of odd integers.

Then $\struct {S, +, \times}$ is not an integral domain.


Proof
Consider the odd integers $1$ and $3$.
We have that $1 + 3 = 4$.
But $4$ is not odd.
Thus addition on $\struct {S, +, \times}$ is not closed.
Hence $\struct {S, +, \times}$ is not even a ring, let alone an integral domain.
$\blacksquare$

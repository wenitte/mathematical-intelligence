Corollary to Cancellability of Congruences
Let $a, b, c$ be integers.
Let $p$ be a prime number such that $p \nmid c$.

Then:

$c a \equiv c b \pmod p \implies a \equiv b \pmod p$
where $\equiv$ denotes congruence.


Proof
As $p \nmid c$, it follows from Prime not Divisor implies Coprime that:

$p \perp c$
where $\perp$ denotes that $p$ and $c$ are coprime.

The result follows from Cancellability of Congruences: Corollary $1$.
$\blacksquare$

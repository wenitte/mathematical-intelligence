Theorem
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be an additive function.
Then:

$\map f 0 = 0$


Proof
As $f$ is additive, we have:














\(\ds \map f 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {0 + 1}\)





Real Addition Identity is Zero














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f 0 + \map f 1\)





Definition of Additive Function



that is:

$\map f 0 = 0$
$\blacksquare$

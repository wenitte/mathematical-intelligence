Example of Rounding to Even
$116 \, 500 \, 000$ rounded to the nearest million using rounding to even is $116 \, 000 \, 000$.


Proof
We have that $116 \, 500 \, 000$ is equally far away from $116 \, 000 \, 000$ as it is from $117 \, 000 \, 000$.
But $116 \, 000 \, 000$ ends in an even integer.
That is, $\dfrac {116 \, 000 \, 000} {10^6} = 116$ is even.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

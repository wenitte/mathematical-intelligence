Theorem
Let $A$ be a proper class.
Let $B$ be a class which is not empty.

Then the Cartesian product $\paren {A \times B}$ is a proper class.

Aiming for a contradiction, suppose that $\paren {A \times B}$ is small.
By Domain of Small Relation is Small, the domain of $\paren {A \times B}$ is small.

Since $B \ne \O$, Nonempty Class has Members shows that $\exists y: y \in B$.
The domain of $\paren {A \times B}$ is the collection of all $x \in A$ such that $\exists y: y \in B$.

The domain of $\paren {A \times B}$ is $A$.
Therefore, $A$ is small, contradicting the fact that it is a proper class.
$\blacksquare$

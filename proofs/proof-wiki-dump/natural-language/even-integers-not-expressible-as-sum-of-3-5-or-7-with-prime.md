Theorem
The even integers that cannot be expressed as the sum of $2$ prime numbers where one of those primes is $3$, $5$ or $7$ begins:

$98, 122, 124, 126, 128, 148, 150, \ldots$
This sequence is A283555 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (N. J. A. Sloane (Ed.), 2008).


Proof
These are the primes which coincide with the upper end of a prime gap greater than $6$.
These can be found at:

$89$ to $97$: prime gap of $8$
$113$ to $127$: prime gap of $14$
$139$ to $149$: prime gap of $10$
and so on.

We have that:














\(\ds 98\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 19 + 79\)




















\(\ds 122\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13 + 109\)




















\(\ds 124\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 11 + 113\)




















\(\ds 126\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13 + 113\)




















\(\ds 128\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 19 + 109\)









and so on.
$\blacksquare$

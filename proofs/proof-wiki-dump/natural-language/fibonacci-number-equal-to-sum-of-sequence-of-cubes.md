Theorem
The following Fibonacci number can be expressed as the sum of a sequence of cubes:

$F_{18} = 2584 = 7^3 + 8^3 + 9^3 + 10^3$

Proof













\(\ds 2584\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 343 + 512 + 729 + 1000\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7^3 + 8^3 + 9^3 + 10^3\)









$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
In his Curious and Interesting Numbers, 2nd ed. of $1997$, David Wells attributes this result to Michal Stajsczak, but gives no context.

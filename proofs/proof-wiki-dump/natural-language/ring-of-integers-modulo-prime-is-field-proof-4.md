Theorem
Let $m \in \Z: m \ge 2$.
Let $\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$‎ be the ring of integers modulo $m$.

Then:

$m$ is prime
if and only if:

$\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$ is a field.


Proof
Let $m$ be prime.
From Ring of Integers Modulo Prime is Integral Domain, $\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$ is an integral domain.
From Finite Integral Domain is Galois Field, $\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$ is a field.
$\Box$

Now suppose $m \in \Z: m \ge 2$ is composite.
From Ring of Integers Modulo Composite is not Integral Domain, $\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$ is not an integral domain.
From Field is Integral Domain $\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$ is not a field.
$\blacksquare$

Every letter represents a different digit, and, of course, $A C$, $B C$ etc., are two-figure numbers.
Can you find the values in figures of all the letters?


Solution
 A B C D E F H J K L
---------------------
 1 3 5 7 8 9 6 4 2 0

Proof
Trivially from $(8)$ and $(9)$

$L = 0$
Hence immediately from $(1)$:

$A = 1$
Hence:

$10 < A C < 20$
From $(2)$ we inspect pairs ending in the same digit whose divisor is that same digit twice, and this leads us to:

$C = 5$
Hence:














\(\ds C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)





by inspection of possibilities








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds B \times C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 5 = 15\)

\(\ds = A C\)



$A = 1$ constrains $B$ to $3$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds C \times D\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 \times 7 = 35\)

\(\ds = B C\)



We know both $B = 3$ and $C = 5$, which gives us $D$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds D \times E\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \times 8 = 56\)

\(\ds = C H\)



We know both $D = 7$ and $C = 5$, which constrains $E$ and $H$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds E \times F\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8 \times 9 = 72\)

\(\ds = D K\)



We know both $E = 8$ and $D = 7$, which constrains $D$ and $K$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds F \times H\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 \times 6 = 54\)

\(\ds = C J\)



We know both $F = 9$ and $C = 5$, which constrains $C$ and $J$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds H \times J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \times 4 = 24\)

\(\ds = K J\)



We about know everything now anyway

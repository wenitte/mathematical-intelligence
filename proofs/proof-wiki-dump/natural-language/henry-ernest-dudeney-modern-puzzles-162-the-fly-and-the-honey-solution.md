The Fly and the Honey
I have a cylindrical cup four inches high and six inches in circumference.
On the inside of the vessel, one inch from the top, is a drop of honey,
and on the opposite side of the vessel, one inch from the bottom on the outside, is a fly.
Can you tell exactly how far the fly must walk to reach the honey?


Solution
$5$ inches.


Proof
Let $F$ be the starting position of the fly and $H$ be the position of the honey.


We unroll the mug and lay it flat so as to see the geometry easily.
The shortest distance between $F$ and $H$ is found by Heron's Principle of Reflection to be via the point $A$.
We extend $FA$ to $B$ where $B$ is the reflection of $H$ in the rim of the cup.
We see that the fly needs to move:

$3$ inches horizontally.
$3$ inches vertically and another inch vertically for a total of $4$ inches vertically.
The shortest distance from $F$ to $H$ is then found by Pythagoras's Theorem, where $FB$ is seen to be the hypotenuse of the $3$-$4$-$5$ triangle.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, +, \circ, \preceq}$ be an ordered ring.

Then the identity mapping $I_S: S \to S$ is an ordered ring automorphism.


Proof
We have that:

an identity mapping is an order isomorphism
an identity mapping is a group automorphism
an identity mapping is a semigroup automorphism
Hence the result by definition of ordered ring automorphism.
$\blacksquare$

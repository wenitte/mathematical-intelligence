Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group.
Then $\struct {G, \circ}$ is a cancellable monoid.


Proof
By definition, a group is a fortiori a monoid.
From Group Operation is Cancellable, $\circ$ is a cancellable operation in $G$.
Hence the result by definition of cancellable monoid.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Problem from Haidao Suanjing by Liu Hui
What is the size of a square inscribed in the corner of a right-angled triangle to touch the hypotenuse?


Solution
Let the lengths of the legs of the given right-angled triangle be $a$ and $b$.
Then the length of the side of the inscribed square is $\dfrac {a b} {a + b}$.


Proof
Let $x$ be the length of the side of the inscribed square be $x$.
Without loss of generality, let $a < b$.
Let the right-angled triangle be half of a rectangle whose sides are of length $a$ and $b$.
Let the rectangle be dissected along the straight lines shown.


Let the pieces of the dissection be assembled into a rectangle whose sides are of length $a + b$ and  $x$.
Then we have:

$a b = x \paren {a + b}$
and the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

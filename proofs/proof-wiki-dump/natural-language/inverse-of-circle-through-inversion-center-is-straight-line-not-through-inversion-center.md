Theorem
Let an arbitrary circle $K$ be drawn in the plane.
Let $A'$ and $P'$ be arbitrary points on $K$.
Let $T$ be an inversive transformation such that:

the inversion center of $T$ is $O$
the inversion circle $O$ for $T$ is chosen such that $OA'$ is a diameter of $K$
the radius of $O$ is $r$.
Let $A$ and $P$ be the images of $A'$ and $P'$ under $T$ respectively.
Let $L$ be a straight line drawn perpendicular to the extension of $OA'$ at point $A$.
Then $P$ lies on $L$.


Proof
The diagrams show the two cases:

$K$ completely inside the circle on $O$




or with some points outside



The proof is the same for both cases.














\(\ds OP \cdot OP'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds OA \cdot OA'\)





definition of $T$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {OP} {OA}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {OA'} {OP'}\)





rearranging



$\angle AOP$ is shared.














\(\ds \triangle OAP\)

\(\sim\)







\(\ds \triangle OP'A'\)





Triangles with One Equal Angle and Two Sides Proportional are Similar








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \angle OAP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 90 \degrees\)





Definition of Perpendicular



By Perpendicular from Point to Straight Line in Plane is Unique:

there is only one straight line perpendicular to a straight line at a given point.

So:

$AP$ is the same straight line as $L$
That is, $P$ lies on $L$.
$P$ is the image under $T$ of an arbitrary point $P'$ on $K$, and $P$ lies on $L$.
$\blacksquare$

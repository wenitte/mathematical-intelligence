Theorem
$\sqrt [3] 2$ is irrational.


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose that $\sqrt [3] 2$ is rational.
Then:














\(\ds \sqrt [3] 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac p q\)





for some integer $p$ and $q$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p^3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds q^3 + q^3\)









which contradicts Fermat's Last Theorem.
$\blacksquare$

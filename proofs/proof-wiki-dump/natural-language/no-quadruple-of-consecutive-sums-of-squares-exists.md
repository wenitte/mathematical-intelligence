Theorem
It is not possible for a quadruple of consecutive positive integers each of which is the sum of two squares.


Proof
$4$ consecutive positive integers will be in the forms:














\(\ds n_0\)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 0\)

\(\ds \pmod 4\)


















\(\ds n_1\)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 1\)

\(\ds \pmod 4\)


















\(\ds n_2\)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 2\)

\(\ds \pmod 4\)


















\(\ds n_3\)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 3\)

\(\ds \pmod 4\)







in some order.
But from Sum of Two Squares not Congruent to 3 modulo 4, $n_3$ cannot be the sum of two squares.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

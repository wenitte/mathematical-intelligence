Theorem
Let $\struct {\C_{\ne 0}, \times}$ be the multiplicative group of complex numbers.
Let $\struct {\C, +}$ be the additive group of complex numbers.

Then $\struct {\C_{\ne 0}, \times}$ is not isomorphic to $\struct {\C, +}$.


Proof
A direct application of Additive Group and Multiplicative Group of Field are not Isomorphic.
$\blacksquare$

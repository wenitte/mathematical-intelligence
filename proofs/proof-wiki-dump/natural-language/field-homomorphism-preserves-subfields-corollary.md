Corollary to Field Homomorphism Preserves Subfields
Let $\struct {F_1, +_1, \circ_1}$ and $\struct {F_2, +_2, \circ_2}$ be fields.

The image of a field homomorphism $\phi: F_1 \to F_2$ is a subfield of $F_2$.


Proof
From Field is Subfield of Itself, $F_1$ is a subfield of $F_1$.
The result then follows directly from Field Homomorphism Preserves Subfields.
$\blacksquare$

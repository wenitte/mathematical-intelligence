Theorem
Let $K$ be a hyperbola whose transverse axis is $2 a$ and whose conjugate axis is $2 b$.
Let $c$ be the distance of the foci of $K$ from the center.
Then:

$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$


Proof
Â 



Let the foci of $K$ be $F_1$ and $F_2$.
Let the vertices of $K$ be $V_1$ and $V_2$.
Let the covertices of $K$ be $C_1$ and $C_2$.

Let $P = \tuple {x, y}$ be an arbitrary point on the locus of $K$.
From the equidistance property of $K$ we have that:

$\size {F_1 P - F_2 P} = d$
where $d$ is a constant for this particular hyperbola.
This is true for all points on $K$.

In particular, it holds true for $V_2$, for example.
Thus:














\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds F_1 V_2 - F_2 V_2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {c + a} - \paren {c - a}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 a\)

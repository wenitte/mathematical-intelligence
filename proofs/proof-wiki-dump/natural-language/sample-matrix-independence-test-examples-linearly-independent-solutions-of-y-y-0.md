Example of Sample Matrix Independence Test: Linearly Independent Solutions of $y - y = 0$
Prove independence of the solutions $e^x$, $e^{-x}$ to:

$y - y = 0$ 


Proof
Choose samples $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = 1$ from set $J = \R$. 
Define $\map {f_1} x = e^x$, $\map {f_2} x = e^{-x}$.
Then the sample matrix is:

$S = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
e & 1/e \\
\end{bmatrix}$
Matrix $S$ is invertible.
Then $\map {f_1} x = e^x$, $\map {f_2} x = e^{-x}$ are linearly independent.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Cardinality
Let $S_2 = \set {x \in \Z: 0 < x < 6}$.

The cardinality of $S_2$ is given by:

$\card {S_2} = 5$


Proof
The elements of $S_2$, by definition, are those integers greater than $0$ and less than $6$.
That is:

$S_2 = \set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$
Thus $S_2$ has $5$ elements: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.
Hence the result by definition of cardinality.
$\blacksquare$

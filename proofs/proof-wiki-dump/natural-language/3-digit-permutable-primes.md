Theorem
The $3$-digit permutable primes are:

$311, 199, 337$
and their anagrams, and no other.


Proof
It is confirmed that:

$113, 131, 311$ are all prime
$199, 919, 991$ are all prime
$337, 373, 733$ are all prime.

From Digits of Permutable Prime, all permutable primes contain digits in the set:

$\left\{ {1, 3, 7, 9}\right\}$

The sum of a $3$-digit repdigit number is divisible by $3$.
By Divisibility by 3 it follows that all $3$-digit repdigit numbers are divisible by $3$ and therefore composite.

Hence the possibly permutable primes are:

$113, 117, 119, 133, 137, 139, 177, 179, 199, 337, 339, 377, 379, 399, 779, 799$
and their anagrams.
We eliminate $113, 199, 337$ from this list, as it has been established that they are permutable primes.

Of those remaining, the following are composite:














\(\ds 117\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3^2 \times 13\)




















\(\ds 119\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \times 17\)




















\(\ds 133\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \times 19\)




















\(\ds 177\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 59\)




















\(\ds 339\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 113\)




















\(\ds 377\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13 \times 29\)




















\(\ds 779\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 19 \times 41\)




















\(\ds 799\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 17 \times 47\)










It remains to demonstrate that at least one anagram of the remaining numbers:

$137, 139, 179, 379$
is composite.
We find that:














\(\ds 371\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \times 53\)




















\(\ds 319\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 11 \times 29\)




















\(\ds 791\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \times 113\)




















\(\ds 793\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13 \times 61\)










All contenders are eliminated except for the established permutable primes $113, 119, 337$ and their anagrams.

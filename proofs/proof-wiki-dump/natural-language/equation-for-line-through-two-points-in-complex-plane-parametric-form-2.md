Theorem
Let $z_1, z_2 \in \C$ be complex numbers.
Let $L$ be a straight line through $z_1$ and $z_2$ in the complex plane.

$L$ can be expressed by the equations:














\(\ds x - x_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t \paren {x_2 - x_1}\)




















\(\ds y - y_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t \paren {y_2 - y_1}\)










These are the parametric equations of $L$, where $t$ is the parameter.


Proof
From Equation for Line through Two Points in Complex Plane: Parametric Form 1:

$z = z_1 + t \paren {z_2 - z_1}$

Letting:














\(\ds z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x + i y\)




















\(\ds z_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x_1 + i y_1\)




















\(\ds z_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x_2 + i y_2\)









the parametric equations follow by equating real parts and imaginary parts.

Theorem
Let $E$ be a vector space of $n$ dimensions.
Let $H$ be a linearly independent subset of $E$.

Then:

$H$ has at most $n$ elements.


Proof
Let $H$ be a linearly independent subset of $E$.
By definition of dimension of vector space, $E$ has a basis with exactly $n$ elements.
By Sufficient Conditions for Basis of Finite Dimensional Vector Space, $B$ is a generator for $E$.
Then by Size of Linearly Independent Subset is at Most Size of Finite Generator, $H$ has at most $n$ elements.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group whose identity is $e$.
Let $*$ be the conjugacy group action on $G$:

$\forall g, h \in G: g * h = g \circ h \circ g^{-1}$

Let $x \in G$.
Then the orbit of $x$ under this group action is:

$\Orb x = C_x$
where $C_x$ is the conjugacy class of $x$.


Proof
Follows from the definition of the conjugacy class.

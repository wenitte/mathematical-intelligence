Theorem
Let $\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$ be the $p$-adic norm on the rationals $\Q$ for some prime number $p$.
Let $\size {\,\cdot\,}$ be the absolute value on the rationals $\Q$.

Then $\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$ and $\size {\,\cdot\,}$ are not equivalent norms.
That is, the topology induced by $\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$ does not equal the topology induced by $\size {\,\cdot\,}$.


Proof
By definition of the $p$-adic norm:

$\norm p_p = \frac 1 p < 1$
By definition of the absolute value:

$\size p = p > 1$
By definition of open unit ball equivalence, $\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$ and $\size {\,\cdot\,}$ are not equivalent norms.

By Equivalence of Definitions of Equivalent Division Ring Norms and the definition of topologically equivalent norms then the topology induced by $\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$ does not equal the topology induced by $\size{\,\cdot\,}$.
$\blacksquare$

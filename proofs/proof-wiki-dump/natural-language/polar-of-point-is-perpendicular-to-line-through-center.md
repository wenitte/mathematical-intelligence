Theorem
Let $\CC$ be a circle.
Let $P$ be a point.
Let $\LL$ be the polar of $P$ with respect to $\CC$.

Then $\LL$ is perpendicular to the straight line through $P$ and the center of $\CC$.


Proof
Let $\CC$ be positioned so as for its center to be at the origin of a Cartesian plane.
Let $P$ be located at $\tuple {x_0, y_0}$.
From Equation of Straight Line in Plane, $P$ can be described as:

$y = \dfrac {y_0} {x_0} x$
and so has slope $\dfrac {y_0} {x_0}$.
By definition of polar, $\LL$ has the equation:

$x x_0 + y y_0 = r^2$
which has slope $-\dfrac {x_0} {y_0}$.

Hence the result from Condition for Straight Lines in Plane to be Perpendicular.
$\blacksquare$

Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $21$
De Campo et Ovibus in Eo Locandis
Sheep in a Field
There is a field $200$ feet long and $100$ feet wide.
I want to put sheep in it, so that each sheep has $5$ feet by $4$.
How many sheep can I put in there?


Solution
$1000$.


Proof
We have that:

$5$ goes into $200$ a total of $40$ times
$4$ goes into $100$ also a total of $25$ times.
Thus we can put $40 \times 25 = 1000$ sheep into that field.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

Parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them taken in corresponding order.
(The Elements: Book $\text{V}$: Proposition $15$)

That is:

$a : b \implies ma = mb$


Proof
Let $AB$ be the same multiple of $C$ that $DE$ is of $F$.


So as many magnitudes as there are in $AB$ equal to $C$, so many are there also in $DE$ equal to $F$.
Let $AB$ be divided into the magnitudes $AG, GH, HB$ equal to $C$.
Let $DE$ be divided into the magnitudes $DK, KL, LE$ equal to $F$.
Then the number of magnitudes $AG, GH, GB$ is the same as the number of magnitudes in $DK, KL, LE$.
We have that $AG = GH = HB$ and $DK = KL = LE$.
So from Ratios of Equal Magnitudes it follows that $AG : DK = GH : KL = HB : LE$.
Then from Sum of Components of Equal Ratios $AG : DK = AB : DE$.
But $AG = C$ and $DK = F$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $15$ of Book $\text{V}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

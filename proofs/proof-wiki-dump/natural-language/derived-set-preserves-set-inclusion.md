Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $B \subseteq A \subseteq S$.

Then:

$B' \subseteq A'$
where $A'$ and $B'$ are the derived sets in $T$ of $A$ and $B$ respectively.


Proof
Let: 

$x \in B'$
By the definition of derived set:

$x$ is a limit point of $B$.
Note that $B \subseteq A$.
From Limit Point of Subset is Limit Point of Set:

$x$ is a limit point of $A$.
So, $x \in A'$.
That is:

$B' \subseteq A'$
$\blacksquare$

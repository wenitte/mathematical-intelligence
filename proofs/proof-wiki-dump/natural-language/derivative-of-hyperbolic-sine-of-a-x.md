Theorem
$\map {D_x} {\sinh a x} = a \cosh a x$


Proof













\(\ds \map {D_x} {\sinh x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cosh x\)





Derivative of $\sinh x$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {D_x} {\sinh a x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \cosh a x\)





Derivative of Function of Constant Multiple

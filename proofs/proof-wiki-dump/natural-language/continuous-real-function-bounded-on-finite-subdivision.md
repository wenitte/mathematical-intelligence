Theorem
Let $A = \closedint a b$ be a closed real interval of the set $\R$ of real numbers.
Let $f: A \to \R$ be a continuous real function on $A$.
Let $P = \set {x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n - 1}, x_n}$ be a finite subdivision of $A$ such that:

each $\closedint {x_j} {x_{j + 1} }$ is a neighborhood of some $a_j$ such that $f$ is bounded on $\closedint {x_j} {x_{j + 1} }$.

Then $f$ is bounded on $A$.


Proof
Follows directly from:

Continuous Real Function is Bounded on Neighborhood of Argument
and:

Mapping is Bounded on Union iff Bounded on Each Component/Real-Valued Function.
$\blacksquare$

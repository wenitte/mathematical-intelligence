This article is complete as far as it goes, but it could do with expansion.In particular: Expand for $\sin^{-1}$ on complex plane, include this as a corollaryYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by adding this information.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Expand}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Theorem
Everywhere that the function is defined:

$\map \arcsin {-x} = -\arcsin x$


Proof













\(\ds \map \arcsin {-x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds -x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sin y:\)

\(\ds -\frac \pi 2 \le y \le \frac \pi 2\)

\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\sin y:\)

\(\ds -\frac \pi 2 \le y \le \frac \pi 2\)

\(\ds \map \sin {-y}:\)

\(\ds -\frac \pi 2 \le y \le \frac \pi 2\)

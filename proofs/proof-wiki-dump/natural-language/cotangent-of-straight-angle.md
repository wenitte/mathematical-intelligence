Theorem
$\cot 180^\circ = \cot \pi$ is undefined
where $\cot$ denotes cotangent.


Proof
From Cotangent is Cosine divided by Sine:

$\cot \theta = \dfrac {\cos \theta} {\sin \theta}$
When $\sin \theta = 0$, $\dfrac {\cos \theta} {\sin \theta}$ can be defined only if $\cos \theta = 0$.
But there are no such $\theta$ such that both $\cos \theta = 0$ and $\sin \theta = 0$.
When $\theta = \pi$, $\sin \theta = 0$.
Thus $\cot \theta$ is undefined at this value.
$\blacksquare$

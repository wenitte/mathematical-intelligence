Theorem
Let $f$ be a mapping.

Then its inverse $f^{-1}$ is a one-to-many relation.
Hence $f^{-1}$ is not necessarily a mapping itself.


Proof
We have that $f$ is a mapping.
Hence $f$ is a fortiori a many-to-one relation.
Then from Inverse of Many-to-One Relation is One-to-Many, $f^{-1}$ is one-to-many.
$\blacksquare$

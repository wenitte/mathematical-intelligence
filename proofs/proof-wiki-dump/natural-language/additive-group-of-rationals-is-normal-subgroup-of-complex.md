Theorem
Let $\struct {\Q, +}$ be the additive group of rational numbers.
Let $\struct {\C, +}$ be the additive group of complex numbers.

Then $\struct {\Q, +}$ is a normal subgroup of $\struct {\C, +}$.


Proof
From Additive Group of Rationals is Normal Subgroup of Reals, $\struct {\Q, +} \lhd \struct {\R, +}$.
From Additive Group of Reals is Normal Subgroup of Complex, $\struct {\R, +} \lhd \struct {\C, +}$.
Thus $\struct {\Q, +} \le \struct {\C, +}$.
From Complex Numbers under Addition form Infinite Abelian Group, $\struct {\C, +}$ is abelian.
From Subgroup of Abelian Group is Normal, it follows that $\struct {\Q, +} \lhd \struct {\C, +}$.

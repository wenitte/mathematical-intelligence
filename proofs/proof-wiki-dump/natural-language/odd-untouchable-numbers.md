Unproven Hypothesis
It is highly likely that $5$ is the only odd untouchable number.


Progress
This would follow from a slightly stronger form of Goldbach's Conjecture:

Every even integer $n > 6$ is the sum of two distinct primes.

Let $2 n + 1$ be an odd integer number greater than $7$.
Then by the conjecture:

$2 n = p + q$
The aliquot parts of $p q$ are $1$, $p$ and $q$.
Then:

$1 + p + q = 2 n + 1$
and so $2 n + 1$ is not untouchable. 
Then we have that $1$, $3$ and $7$ are not untouchable, as they are the aliquot sums of $2$, $4$ and $8$ respectively.
That leaves $5$ as the only odd untouchable number.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct{S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $F \subseteq S$ be a closed set in $T$.

Then:

$S \setminus F \in \tau$
Proof
By definition of closed set:

$\exists U \in \tauÂ : F = S \setminus U$
From Relative Complement inverts Subsets of Relative Complement:

$U = S \setminus F$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

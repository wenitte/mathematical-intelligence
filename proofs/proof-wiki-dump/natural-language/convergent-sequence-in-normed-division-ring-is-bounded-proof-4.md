Theorem
Let $\struct {R, \norm {\,\cdot\,}}$ be a normed division ring.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a sequence in $R$.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be convergent in the norm $\norm {\,\cdot\,}$ to the following limit:

$\ds \lim_{n \mathop \to \infty} x_n = l$

Then $\sequence {x_n}$ is bounded.


Proof
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be convergent to the limit $l$ in $\struct {R, \norm {\,\cdot\,}}$.
By Convergent Sequence is Cauchy Sequence in Normed Division Ring, $\sequence {x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\struct {R, \norm {\,\cdot\,}}$.
By Cauchy Sequence in Normed Division Ring is Bounded, $\sequence {x_n}$ is a bounded sequence in $\struct {R, \norm {\,\cdot\,}}$.
$\blacksquare$

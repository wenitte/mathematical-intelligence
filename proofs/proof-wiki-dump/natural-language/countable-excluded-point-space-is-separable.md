Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_{\bar p} }$ be a countable excluded point space.

Then $T$ is a separable space.


Proof
The closure of the set $S$ (trivially) equals $S$.
That is, $S$ is everywhere dense in $T$.
But as $S$ is countable it follows by definition that $T$ is separable.
$\blacksquare$

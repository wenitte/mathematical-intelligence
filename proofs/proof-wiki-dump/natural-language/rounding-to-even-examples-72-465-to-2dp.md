Example of Rounding to Even
$72 \cdotp 465$ rounded to $2$ decimal places using rounding to even is $72 \cdotp 46$.


Proof
We have that $72 \cdotp 465$ is equally far away from $72 \cdotp 46$ as it is from $72 \cdotp 47$.
But $72 \cdotp 46$ ends in an even integer.
That is, $7246$ is even.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

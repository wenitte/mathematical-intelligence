Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $\text {33 a}$
De Alio Patrefamilias Erogante Suae Familiae Annonam
Another Landlord Apportioning Grain
A gentleman has a household of $90$ persons and ordered that they be given $90$ measures of grain.
He directs that:
each man should receive $3$ measures,
each woman $2$ measures,
and each child $\frac 1 2$ a measure.
How many men, women and children must there be?


Solution
There are $5$ solutions:

$15$ men, $5$ women and $70$ children
$12$ men, $10$ women and $68$ children
$9$ men, $15$ women and $66$ children
$6$ men, $20$ women and $64$ children
$3$ men, $25$ women and $62$ children.

The solution given by Alcuin is:

$6$ men, $20$ women and $64$ children.


Proof
Let $m$, $w$ and $c$ denote the number of men, women and children respectively.
We have:














\(\ds 3 m + 2 w + \dfrac c 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 90\)





apportioning the measures of grain




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 m + 4 w + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 180\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds m + w + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 90\)





the total number of people




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 m + 3 w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 90\)





$(1) - (2)$



We note that $5 m$ is a multiple of $5$.
Hence $3 w$ also has to be a multiple of $5$.
Thus $w$ has to be a multiple of $5$.
Hence the following possible solutions for $m$ and $w$:
Hence the following possible solutions for $m$ and $w$:














\(\ds w = 0\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 18\)




















\(\ds w = 5\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 15\)




















\(\ds w = 10\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 12\)




















\(\ds w = 15\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 9\)




















\(\ds w = 20\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 6\)




















\(\ds w = 25\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 3\)




















\(\ds w = 30\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 0\)










It is implicit that there are at least some men and some women in the household, so the solutions:

$m = 18, w = 0, c = 72$
$m = 0, w = 30, c = 60$
are usually ruled out.

Hence we have the following solutions:

$m = 15, w = 5, c = 70$
$m = 12, w = 10, c = 68$
$m = 10, w = 15, c = 66$
$m = 6, w = 20, c = 64$
$m = 3, w = 25, c = 62$

This can be expressed as:














\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 n\)




















\(\ds w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 30 - 5 n\)




















\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60 + 2 n\)









where $n = 1, 2, \ldots, 5$.

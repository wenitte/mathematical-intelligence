Theorem
Let $L_1 = \struct{S_1, \preceq_1}$ and $L_2 = \struct{S_2, \preceq_2}$ be locales.
Let $f : L_1 \to L_2$ be a continuous map.

Let:

$\map {\operatorname{Sp}} f : \map {\operatorname{Sp}} {L_1} \to \map {\operatorname{Sp}} {L_2}$ denote the continuous mapping induced by $f$
where:

$\map {\operatorname{Sp}} {L_1}$ and $\map {\operatorname{Sp}} {L_2}$ denote the spectra of $L_1$ and $L_2$, respectively

Then:

$\map {\operatorname{Sp}} f$ is a continuous mapping


Proof
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $X \subseteq \R$.
Let $fÂ : X \to \R$ be a continuous function.

Then $f$ is a Baire function.


Proof
For each natural number $n$, define: 

$\map {f_n} x = \map f x$
Since $f$ is continuous: 

$f_n$ is continuous for each $n$.
Clearly, for each $x \in X$ we have: 

$\ds \lim_{n \mathop \to \infty} \map {f_n} x = \map f x$
from Eventually Constant Sequence Converges to Constant. 
So:

$\sequence {f_n}$ is a sequence of continuous functions that converges pointwise to $f$.
So $f$ is a Baire function.
$\blacksquare$

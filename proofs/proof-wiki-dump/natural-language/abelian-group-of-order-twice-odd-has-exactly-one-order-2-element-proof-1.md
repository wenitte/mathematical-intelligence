Theorem
Let $G$ be an abelian group whose identity element is $e$.
Let the order of $G$ be $2 n$ such that $n$ is odd.

Then there exists exactly one $g \in G$ with $g \ne e$ such that $g = g^{-1}$.


Proof
By Abelian Group Factored by Prime, the subgroup $H_2$ defined as:

$H_2Â := \set {g \in G: g^2 = e}$
has precisely two elements.

One of them has to be $e$, since $e^2 = e$.
The result follows.

Theorem
Let $\mathbf x$ be a vector in a vector space of $3$ dimensions:

$\mathbf x = x_i \mathbf i + x_j \mathbf j + x_k \mathbf k$

Then:

$\mathbf x \times \mathbf x = \mathbf 0$
where $\times$ denotes vector cross product.


Proof
By definition, a vector is parallel to itself.
The result follows from Cross Product of Parallel Vectors.
$\blacksquare$

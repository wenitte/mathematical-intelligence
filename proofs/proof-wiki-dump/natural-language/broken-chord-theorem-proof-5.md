Theorem


Let $A$ and $C$ be arbitrary points on a circle in the plane.
Let $M$ be a point on the circle with arc $AM = $ arc $MC$.
Let $B$ lie on the minor arc of $AM$.
Draw chords $AB$ and $BC$.
Find $D$ such that $MD \perp BC$.
Then:

$AB + BD = DC$


Proof

Given $MD \perp BC$
Draw $MN \parallel BC$ to meet the circle at $N$.
Draw $NE \parallel MD$.
By Quadrilateral is Parallelogram iff Both Pairs of Opposite Sides are Equal or Parallel:

$MNED$ is a parallelogram
By Parallelogram with One Right Angle is Rectangle:

$MNED$ is a rectangle.

By Parallelism implies Equal Corresponding Angles:

$\angle MDB = \angle NEC$
and both are right angles.

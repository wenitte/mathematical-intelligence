Example of Non-Square Positive Integers not Sum of Square and Prime
$58$ cannot be expressed as the sum of a square and a prime.


Proof
Testing each $m \in \Z_{>0}$ such that $m^2 < 58$ it is established that there is no solution to $58 - m^2 = p$ where $p$ is prime:














\(\ds 58 - 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 57\)





which is composite: $57 = 3 \times 19$














\(\ds 58 - 4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 54\)





which is composite: $54 = 2 \times 3^3$














\(\ds 58 - 9\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 49\)





which is composite: $49 = 7^2$














\(\ds 58 - 16\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 42\)





which is composite: $42 = 2 \times 3 \times 7$














\(\ds 58 - 25\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 33\)





which is composite: $33 = 3 \times 11$














\(\ds 58 - 36\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 22\)





which is composite: $22 = 2 \times 11$














\(\ds 58 - 49\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9\)





which is composite: $9 = 3^2$



$\blacksquare$

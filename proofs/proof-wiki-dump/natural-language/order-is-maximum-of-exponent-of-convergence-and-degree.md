Theorem
Let $f: \C \to \C$ be an entire function.
Let $\omega$ be its order.
Let $\tau$ be its exponent of convergence.
Let $h$ be the degree of the polynomial in its canonical factorization.

Then:

$\omega = \map \max {\tau, h}$


Proof
By Exponent of Convergence is Less Than Order:

$\tau \le \omega$
By Hadamard Factorization Theorem:

$h \le \omega$
Thus:

$\map \max {\tau, h} \le \omega$
By Order is Less Than Maximum of Exponent of Convergence and Degree:

$\omega \le \map \max {\tau, h}$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number.
Then:

$\size x = \size {-x}$
where $\size x$ denotes the absolute value of $x$.


Proof
Let $x \ge 0$.
By definition of absolute value:

$\size x = x$
We have that:

$-x < 0$
and so by definition of absolute value:

$\size {-x} = -\paren {-x} = x$
$\Box$

Now let $x < 0$.
By definition of absolute value:

$\size x = -x$
We have that:

$-x > 0$
and so:
and so by definition of absolute value:

$\size {-x} = -x$
$\Box$

In both cases it is seen that:

$\size x = \size {-x}$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a countable set.
Then $S$ is well-orderable.


Proof
By the Well-Ordering Principle, the set of natural numbers $\N$ under the usual ordering $\le$ forms a well-ordered set.
By definition of countable set, there exists an injection:

$f: S \to \N$
Let $V$ be a basic universe.
By definition of basic universe:

$S \in V$
and:

$\N \in V$
By the Axiom of Transitivity, both $S$ and $\N$ are classes.
From Class which has Injection to Subclass of Well-Orderable Class is Well-Orderable, it follows that $S$ is well-orderable.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

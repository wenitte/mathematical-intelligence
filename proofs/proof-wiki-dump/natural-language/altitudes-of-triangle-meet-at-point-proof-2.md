Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.

The altitudes of $\triangle ABC$ all intersect at the same point.


Proof

In $\triangle ABC$ construct the altitude from vertex $A$ to side $BC$ at $P$.
Also draw the altitude from vertex $B$ to side $AC$ at $Q$.
By Two Straight Lines make Equal Opposite Angles:

$\angle AOQ = \angle BOP$
Given:

$\angle AQO = \angle BPO = $ one right angle.
By Triangles with Two Equal Angles are Similar:

$\triangle AOQ \sim \triangle BOP$
and:

$\triangle AOQ \sim \triangle ACP \sim \triangle BOP$
By the definition of similarity:

$\dfrac {OP} {BP} = \dfrac {CP} {AP}$
Rearrange:

$OP = \dfrac {BP \cdot CP} {AP}$
Note there is no term related to side $AC$.
If we had used side $AB$ instead of $AC$, we would have the same result.
Therefore, the altitude from vertex $C$ to side $AB$ meets both $AP$ and $BQ$ at $O$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof of Altitudes of Triangle Meet at Point was published by Isaac Newton in about $1680$.

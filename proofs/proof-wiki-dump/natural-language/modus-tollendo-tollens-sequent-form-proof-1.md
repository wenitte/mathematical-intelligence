Theorem
The Modus Tollendo Tollens can be symbolised by the sequent:














\(\ds p\)

\(\implies\)







\(\ds q\)




















\(\ds \neg q\)

\(\)







\(\ds \)














\(\ds \vdash \ \ \)





\(\ds \neg p\)

\(\)







\(\ds \)











Proof
By the tableau method of natural deduction:


$p \implies q, \neg q \vdash \neg p$

Theorem
Let $S$ and $T$ be sets.
Let $f: S \to T$ be a mapping.
Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be subsets of $S$.

Then:

$f \sqbrk {S_1 \cap S_2} \subseteq f \sqbrk {S_1} \cap f \sqbrk {S_2}$

This can be expressed in the language and notation of direct image mappings as:

$\forall S_1, S_2 \in \powerset S: \map {f^\to} {S_1 \cap S_2} \subseteq \map {f^\to} {S_1} \cap \map {f^\to} {S_2}$


Proof













\(\ds S_1 \cap S_2\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds S_1\)





Intersection is Subset








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds f \sqbrk {S_1 \cap S_2}\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds f \sqbrk {S_1}\)





Image of Subset under Mapping is Subset of Image


















\(\ds S_1 \cap S_2\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds S_2\)





Intersection is Subset








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds f \sqbrk {S_1 \cap S_2}\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds f \sqbrk {S_2}\)





Image of Subset under Mapping is Subset of Image












\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds f \sqbrk {S_1 \cap S_2}\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds f \sqbrk {S_1} \cap f \sqbrk {S_2}\)





Intersection is Largest Subset

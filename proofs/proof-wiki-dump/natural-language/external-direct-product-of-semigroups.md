Theorem
The external direct product of two semigroups is itself a semigroup.


Proof
From External Direct Product Closure, the external direct product of two closed algebraic structures is closed.
From External Direct Product Associativity, the external direct product of two associative algebraic structures is associative.
The result follows.

Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a finite ring with unity.
Then the characteristic of $R$ is not zero.


Proof
We have that $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ is finite, so its additive group $\struct {R, +}$ is likewise finite.
The result follows by Element of Finite Group is of Finite Order and the definition of characteristic.
$\blacksquare$

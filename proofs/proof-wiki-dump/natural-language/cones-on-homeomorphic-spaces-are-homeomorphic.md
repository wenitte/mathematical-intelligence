Theorem
Let $X, Y$ be topological spaces.
Suppose:

$X \sim Y$
denoting that $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$.

Then:

$C X \sim C Y$
where $C X$ denotes the cone on $X$.


Proof
Let $T$ be the trivial topological space used in the definition of cone.
We have:

$T \sim T$ by Homeomorphism Relation is Equivalence
$X \sim Y$ by hypothesis
Then, by Joins of Homeomorphic Spaces are Homeomorphic:

$C X \sim C Y$
$\blacksquare$

Examples of Use of Lagrange's Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of $G$ such that:

$\order H = 25$
$\order K = 36$
where $\order {\, \cdot \,}$ denotes the order of the subgroup.
Then:

$900 \divides \order G$
where $\divides$ denotes divisibility.


Proof
From Lagrange's theorem:

$25 \divides \order G$
and:

$36 \divides \order G$
We have that:

$\lcm \set {25, 36} = 900$

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $E$ be a vector space of $n$ dimensions.
Let $G$ be a generator for $E$:

$G$ is a basis for $E$ if and only if $\card G = n$.


Proof
Necessary Condition
Let $G$ be a basis for $E$.
From Cardinality of Basis of Vector Space, $\card G = n$.
$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Let $\card G = n$.
From Sufficient Conditions for Basis of Finite Dimensional Vector Space, $G$ is a basis for $E$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $x$ and $y$ be elements of either the real numbers $\R$ or the complex numbers $\C$.
Then:

$\size {x - y} \ge \size x - \size y$
where $\size x$ denotes either the absolute value of a real number or the complex modulus of a complex number.


Proof
Let $z_1$ and $z_2$ be represented by the points $A$ and $B$ respectively in the complex plane.
From Geometrical Interpretation of Complex Subtraction, we can construct the parallelogram $OACB$ where:

$OA$ and $OB$ represent $z_1$ and $z_2$ respectively
$BA$ represents $z_1 - z_2$.




But $OA$, $OB$ and $BA$ form the sides of a triangle.
The result then follows directly from Sum of Two Sides of Triangle Greater than Third Side.

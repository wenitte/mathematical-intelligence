Example of Problem from Chiu Chang Suann Jing
If $5$ oxen and $2$ sheep together cost $10$ taels of gold,
and $2$ oxen and $5$ sheep together cost $8$ taels,
what are the prices of oxen and sheep respectively?


Solution
An ox costs $1 \frac {11} {21}$ tael.
A sheep costs $\frac {20} {21}$ tael.

It would appear that the numbers for the problem were chosen with no thought to the convenience or plausibility of the answer.


Proof
Let $x$ be the price per ox.
Let $y$ be the price per sheep.

Then:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 5 x + 2 y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 2 x + 5 y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 10 x + 4 y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)





$(1) \times 2$




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 10 x + 25 y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40\)





$(2) \times 5$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 21 y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)





$(4) - (3)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tfrac {20} {21}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 x + 5 \tfrac {20} {21}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 - \tfrac {50} {21}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 \tfrac {11} {21}\)

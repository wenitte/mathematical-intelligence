Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_{\bar p} }$ be an excluded point space.

Then $p$ is a dispersion point of $T$.


Proof
We have that the Excluded Point Topology is Open Extension Topology of Discrete Topology.
So $S \setminus \set p$ is a discrete space.
Then a discrete space is totally disconnected.
The result follows from definition of dispersion point.

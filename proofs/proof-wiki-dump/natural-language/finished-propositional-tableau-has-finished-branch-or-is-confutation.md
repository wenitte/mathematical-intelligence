Theorem
Let $\struct {T, \mathbf H, \Phi}$ be a finished propositional tableau.

Then one of the following holds:

$T$ has a finished branch
$T$ is a tableau confutation.


Proof
Suppose $T$ has no finished branch.
Then since $T$ is finished, every branch of $T$ is contradictory.

Hence $T$ is a tableau confutation.
$\blacksquare$

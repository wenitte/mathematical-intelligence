Mahaviracharya: Ganita Sara Samgraha Chapter $\text {VI}$: Mixed Problems: Problem $95 \frac 1 2$ and $96 \frac 1 2$
Three puranas formed the pay of one man who is a mounted soldier.
At that rate there were $65$ soldiers in all.
Some among them broke down, and the amount of their pay was given to those who remained in the field.
Of this, each man obtained $10$ puranas.
You tell me, after thinking well, how many remained in the field and how many broke down.


Solution
$50$ soldiers broke down, while $15$ remained in the field.


Proof
Let $x$ denote the number of soldiers who remained in the field.
Let $y$ denote the number of soldiers who broke down.

We have:














\(\ds x + y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 65\)





that is, the total number of soldiers




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 3 \paren {x + y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 195\)





that is, the total amount of pay to be distributed




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 3 \paren {x + y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {3 + 10} x\)





that is, the total pay was divided between the soldiers who remained








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 13 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 195\)





substituting for $3 \paren {x + y}$ in $(2)$ from $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 15\)









which leaves $65 - 15 = 50$ soldiers who broke down.
$\blacksquare$

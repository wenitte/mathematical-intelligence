Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $79$
A Cycle Race
Two cyclists race on a circular track.
Brown can ride once round the track in six minutes,
and Robinson in four minutes.
In how many minutes will Robinson overtake Brown?


Solution
$12$ minutes.


Proof
After $4$ minutes, Robinson has completed one circuit, while Brown is $\dfrac 1 3$ the way round his first circuit.
After $8$ minutes, Robinson has completed two circuits, while Brown has completed $1 \tfrac 1 3$ circuits, but Robinson has not yet caught up with Brown.
After $12$ minutes, Robinson has completed $3$ circuits, while Brown has just about completed $2$ circuits, which is the point Robinson overtakes Brown.
$\blacksquare$

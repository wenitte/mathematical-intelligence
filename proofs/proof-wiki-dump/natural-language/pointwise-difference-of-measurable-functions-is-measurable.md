Theorem
Let $\struct {X, \Sigma}$ be a measurable space.
Let $f, g: X \to \overline \R$ be $\Sigma$-measurable functions.
Assume that the pointwise difference $f - g: X \to \overline \R$ is well-defined.

Then $f - g$ is a $\Sigma$-measurable function.


Proof
We have the apparent identity:

$f - g = f + \paren {-g}$
By Negative of Measurable Function is Measurable, $-g$ is a measurable function.

Hence so is $f - g$, by Pointwise Sum of Measurable Functions is Measurable.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\mathbf V$ be a vector space, with zero $\mathbf 0$.
Likewise let $\mathbf V\,'$ be another vector space, with zero $\mathbf 0'$.
Let $T: \mathbf V \to \mathbf V\,'$ be a linear transformation.

Then:

$T: \mathbf 0 \mapsto \mathbf 0'$


Proof
From the vector space axioms we have that $\exists \mathbf 0 \in \mathbf V$.
What remains is to prove that $\map T {\mathbf 0} = \mathbf 0'$:














\(\ds \map T {\mathbf 0}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map T {0 \, \mathbf 0}\)





Zero Vector Scaled is Zero Vector














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0 \, \map T {\mathbf 0}\)

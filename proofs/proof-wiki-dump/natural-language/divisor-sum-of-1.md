Example of Divisor Sum of Integer
$\map {\sigma_1} 1 = 1$
where $\sigma_1$ denotes the divisor sum.


Proof
By definition, the divisor sum of an integer $n$ is the sum of the positive integer divisors of $n$.
There is only one positive integer which is a divisor of $1$, and that is $1$ itself.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

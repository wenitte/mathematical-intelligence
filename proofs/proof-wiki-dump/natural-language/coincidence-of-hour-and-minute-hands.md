Problem
The hour and minute hands of a watch coincide at noon.
When will they once again coincide, during the next $12$ hours?


Solution
The hands coincide at the approximate times, in hours, minutes and seconds:

$13:05:27$
$14:10:55$
$15:16:22$
$16:22:49$
$17:27:16$
$18:32:44$
$19:38:11$
$20:43:38$
$21:49:05$
$22:54:33$
Midnight


Proof
We have that:

the minute hand takes $1$ hour to go $360 \degrees$ around the dial.
the hour hand takes $1$ hour to go $30 \degrees$ around the dial.
Let the minute hand and hour hand be coincident at some point in time.
Let $t$ hours be the time elapsed when they are next coincident.
Let $\theta$ degrees be the angle the hour hand has moved in time $t$.
During $t$, the minute hand has moved $\theta + 360 \degrees$.
Hence we have:














\(\ds \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 30 t\)





angle moved by hour hand














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 360 t - 360\)





angle moved by minute hand less the full circle








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {360} {360 - 330}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 \tfrac 1 {11}\)









That is, the hour hand and minute hand coincide every $1 \tfrac 1 {11}$ hours.
Hence that will be at:

$1 \tfrac 1 {11}, 2 \tfrac 2 {11}, 2 \tfrac 3 {11}, \ldots$
The result follows by converting the fractional hours into minutes and seconds.

Theorem
Let $f: S \to T$ be a mapping.
Then the image of an element of $S$ is equal to the image of a singleton containing that element, the singleton being a subset of $S$:

$\forall s \in S: \set {\map f s} = f \sqbrk {\set s}$


Proof
By definition, a mapping is a relation.
Thus Image of Singleton under Relation applies.
$\blacksquare$

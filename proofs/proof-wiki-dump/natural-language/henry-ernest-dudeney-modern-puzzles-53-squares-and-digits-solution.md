Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $53$
Squares and Digits
What is the smallest square number that terminates with the greatest possible number of similar digits?
Thus the greatest possible number might be $5$ and the smallest square number with $5$ similar digits at the end might be $24677777$.
But this is certainly not a square number.
Of course, $0$ is not to be regarded as a digit.


Solution
$1444 = 38^2$


Proof
See Squares Ending in Repeated Digits.
$\blacksquare$

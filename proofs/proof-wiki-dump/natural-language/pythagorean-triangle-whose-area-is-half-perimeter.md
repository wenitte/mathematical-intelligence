Theorem
The $3-4-5$ triangle is the only Pythagorean triangle whose area is half its perimeter.


Proof
Let $a, b, c$ be the lengths of the sides of a Pythagorean triangle $T$.
Thus $a, b, c$ form a Pythagorean triple.
By definition of Pythagorean triple, $a, b, c$ are in the form:

$2 m n, m^2 - n^2, m^2 + n^2$
We have that $m^2 + n^2$ is always the hypotenuse.
Thus the area of $T$ is given by:

$\AA = m n \paren {m^2 - n^2}$
The perimeter of $T$ is given by:

$\PP = m^2 - n^2 + 2 m n + m^2 + n^2 = 2 m^2 + 2 m n$

We need to find all $m$ and $n$ such that $\PP = 2 \AA$. 
Thus:














\(\ds 2 m^2 + 2 m n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 m n \paren {m^2 - n^2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m + n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n \paren {m + n} \paren {m - n}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n \paren {m - n}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)









As $m$ and $n$ are both (strictly) positive integers, it follows immediately that:

$n = 1$
$m - n = 1$
and so:

$m = 2, n = 1$
and the result follows.

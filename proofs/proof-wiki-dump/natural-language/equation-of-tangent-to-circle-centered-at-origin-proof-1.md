Theorem
Let $\CC$ be a circle whose radius is $r$ and whose center is at the origin of a Cartesian plane.
Let $P = \tuple {x_1, y_1}$ be a point on $\CC$.
Let $\TT$ be a tangent to $\CC$ passing through $P$.

Then $\TT$ can be defined by the equation:

$x x_1 + y y_1 = r^2$


Proof
From Equation of Straight Line Tangent to Circle we have that for a general circle of radius $r$ and center $\tuple {a, b}$:

$y - y_1 = \dfrac {a - x_1} {y_1 - b} \paren {x - x_1}$
is the equation of a tangent $\TT$ to $\CC$ passing through $\tuple {x_1, y_1}$.

Setting the center to $\tuple {0, 0}$:














\(\ds y - y_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac {x_1} {y_1} \paren {x - x_1}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y_1 \paren {y - y_1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -x_1 \paren {x - x_1}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x x_1 + y y_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x_1^2 + y_1^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds r^2\)





as $\tuple {x_1, y_1}$ is on $\CC$

Theorem
There exist non-standard models of arithmetic.


Proof
Let $P$ be the set of axioms of Peano arithmetic.
Let $Q = P \cup \left\{{\neg x = 0, \neg x = s0, \neg x = ss0, \ldots}\right\}$ where $x$ is a variable of the language.
Then each finite subset of $Q$ is satisfied by the standard model of arithmetic
Hence $Q$ is satisfiable by the Compactness theorem.
But any model satisfying $Q$ must assign $x$ to an element which cannot be obtained by iterating the successor operator on zero a finite number of times.

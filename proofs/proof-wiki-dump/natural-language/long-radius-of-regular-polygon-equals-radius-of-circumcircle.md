Theorem
Let $P$ be a regular polygon.
Let $C$ be the circumcircle of $P$.

The long radius of $P$ is equal to the radius of $C$.


Proof
By definition of circumcircle, $C$ is the circle such that all vertices of $P$ are on $C$.
By definition, the center of $P$ is defined as the center of $C$.
Hence:

$OA$ is the radius of $C$
and also:

$OA$ is the long radius of $P$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

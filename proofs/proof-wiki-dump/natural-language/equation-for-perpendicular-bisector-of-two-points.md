Theorem
Let $\tuple {x_1, y_1}$ and $\tuple {y_1, y_2}$ be two points in the cartesian plane.
Let $L$ be the perpendicular bisector of the straight line through $z_1$ and $z_2$ in the complex plane.

$L$ can be expressed by the equation:

$y - \dfrac {y_1 + y_2} 2 = \dfrac {x_1 - x_2} {y_2 - y_1} \paren {x - \dfrac {x_1 + x_2} 2}$


Proof
Let $M$ be the straight line passing through $z_1$ and $z_2$.
Let $Q$ be the midpoint of $M$.
We have that:

$Q = \tuple {\dfrac {x_1 + x_2} 2, \dfrac {y_1 + y_2} 2}$
The slope of $M$ is $\dfrac {y_2 - y_1} {x_2 - x_1}$.

As $L$ is perpendicular to the $M$, its slope is $\dfrac {x_1 - x_2} {y_2 - y_1}$.
Thus by Equation of Straight Line in Plane: Point-Slope Form, the equation for $L$ is:

$y - \dfrac {y_1 + y_2} 2 = \dfrac {x_1 - x_2} {y_2 - y_1} \paren {x - \dfrac {x_1 + x_2} 2}$
$\blacksquare$


Although this article appears correct, it's inelegant. There has to be a better way of doing it.In particular: I can find no actual page on the web anywhere which gives this result explicitly, so I don't know what the "standard form" may be for this line. Hence I have not tried to simplify it, as any such "simplification" only seems to make it more complicated and less intuitive.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by redesigning it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Improve}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

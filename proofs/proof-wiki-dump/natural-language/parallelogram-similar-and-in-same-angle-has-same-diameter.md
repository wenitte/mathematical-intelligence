Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If from a parallelogram there be taken away a parallelogram similar and similarly situated to the whole and having a common angle with it, it is about the same diameter with the whole.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VI}$: Proposition $26$)


Proof
From the parallelogram $\Box ABCD$ let there be taken away the parallelogram $\Box AF$ similar and similarly situated to the whole and having a common angle with it.
We need to show that $\Box ABCD$ is about the same diameter with $\Box AF$.


Suppose it is not, and that $AHC$ is the diameter of $\Box ABCD$.
Let $GF$ be produced to $H$.
From Construction of Parallel Line let $HK$ be drawn parallel to $AD$ and $BC$.
From Parallelograms About Diameter are Similar:

$DA : AB = GA : AK$
But also because of the similarity of $\Box ABCD$ and $\Box EG$:

$DA : AB = GA : AE$
So from Equality of Ratios is Transitive:

$GA : AK = GA : AE$
Therefore from Magnitudes with Same Ratios are Equal:

$AK = AE$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $26$ of Book $\text{VI}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $24$: Parallelograms About Diameter are Similar.

Theorem
Consider the real number line as a metric space under the usual metric.
Let $A \subseteq \R$ such that $A$ is closed in $\R$ and $A \ne \O$.
Let $A$ be bounded below.

Then $A$ contains its infimum.


Proof
From Infimum of Bounded Below Set of Reals is in Closure:

$\inf A \in \map \cl A$
From Set is Closed iff Equals Topological Closure:

$A = \map \cl A$
Therefore $\inf A \in A$.
$\blacksquare$

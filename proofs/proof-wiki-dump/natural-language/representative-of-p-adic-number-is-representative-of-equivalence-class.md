Theorem
Let $p$ be any prime number.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers.
Let $x \in \Q_p$.

Then for any sequence $\sequence{y_n}$ of the rational numbers $\Q$:

$\sequence{y_n}$ is a representative of the $p$-adic number $x$ if and only if $\sequence{y_n}$ is a representative of the equivalence class $x$.
Proof
By definition of the $p$-adic numbers:

$\Q_p$ is quotient ring
By definition of a quotient ring:

$\Q_p$ is a coset space
By definition of a coset space:

Every $p$-adic number $x$ is an equivalence class
By definitions of a representative of a $p$-adic number and a representative of an equivalence class:

for any sequence $\sequence{y_n}$ of the rational numbers $\Q$:
$\sequence{y_n}$ is a representative of the $p$-adic number $x$ if and only if $\sequence{y_n}$ is a representative of the equivalence class $x$.

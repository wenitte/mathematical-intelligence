Theorem
$\ds \int_a^b \paren {\lambda \map f t + \mu \map g t} \rd t = \lambda \int_a^b \map f t \rd t + \mu \int_a^b \map g t \rd t$


Proof
It is clear that for step functions $s$ and $t$:

$\ds \int_a^b \lambda \map s x + \mu \map t x \rd x = \lambda \int_a^b \map s x \rd x + \mu \int_a^b \map t x \rd x$
Under any partition, the lower Darboux sums and upper Darboux sums of $f$ and $g$ are step functions, so the above formula relates the lower Darboux sums and upper Darboux sums of $f$ and $g$ to the lower Darboux sums and upper Darboux sums of the linear combinations of $f$ and $g$.
Because this identity is preserved for all possible partitions of $\closedint a b$, it is preserved for the supremum and infimum of all possible lower Darboux sums and upper Darboux sums, so the linear combinations of $f$ and $g$ are integrable.

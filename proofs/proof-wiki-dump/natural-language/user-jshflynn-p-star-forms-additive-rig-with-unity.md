Theorem
Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet.

Let $\mathcal{P}(\Sigma^{*})$ be the $P$-star of $\Sigma$ and $\circ_L$ denote the language product operation. 

Then $(\mathcal{P}(\Sigma^{*}), \cup, \circ_L)$ is an additive rig with unity.

That is to say it satisfies all three of these conditions:


(1) $(\mathcal{P}(\Sigma^{*}), \cup)$ is a commutative monoid.


(2) $\circ_L$ is distributive over $\cup$.


(3) $(\mathcal{P}(\Sigma^{*}), \circ_L)$ is a monoid.


Proof
Condition (1)
Follows directly from P-star is Commutative Monoid under Union.


Condition (2)
Follows directly from Language Product Distributes over Union.


Condition (3)
Follows directly from P-star is Monoid under Language Product.

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

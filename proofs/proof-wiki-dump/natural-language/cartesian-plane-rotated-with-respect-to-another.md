Theorem
Let $\mathbf r$ be a position vector embedded in a Cartesian plane $\CC$ with origin $O$.
Let $\CC$ be rotated anticlockwise through an angle $\varphi$ about the axis of rotation $O$.
Let $\CC'$ denote the Cartesian plane in its new position.
Let $\mathbf r$ be kept fixed during this rotation.

Let $\tuple {x, y}$ denote the components of $\mathbf r$ with respect to $\CC$.
Let $\tuple {x', y'}$ denote the components of $\mathbf r$ with respect to $\CC'$.

Then:














\(\ds x'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x \cos \varphi + y \sin \varphi\)




















\(\ds y'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -x \sin \varphi + y \cos \varphi\)











Proof


Let $\mathbf r$ be represented by a directed line segment whose initial point coincides with the origin $O$.
Let the terminal point of $\mathbf r$ be identified with the point $P$.
Let $\CC$ be rotated to $\CC'$ through an angle $\varphi$ as shown, keeping $P$ fixed.

We have that:














\(\ds x'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds OA + BP\)





by inspection














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds x \cos \varphi + y \sin \varphi\)





Definition of Cosine, Definition of Sine














\(\ds y'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds xB - xA\)





by inspection














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds y \cos \varphi - x \sin \varphi\)





Definition of Cosine, Definition of Sine



hence the result.

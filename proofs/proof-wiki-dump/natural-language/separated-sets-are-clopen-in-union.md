Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a topological space.
Let $A$ and $B$ be separated sets in $T$.
Let $H = A \cup B$ be given the subspace topology.
Then $A$ and $B$ are each both open and closed in $H$.


Proof
By hypothesis, $A$ and $B$ are separated:

$A \cap B^- = A^- \cap B = \O$
Then:














\(\ds H \cap B^-\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {A \cup B} \cap B^-\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {A \cap B^-} \cup \paren {B \cap B^-}\)





Intersection Absorbs Union














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \O \cup B\)





Set is Subset of its Topological Closure and Intersection with Subset is Subsetâ€Ž














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds B\)





Union with Empty Set



Since the intersection of a closed set with a subspace is closed in the subspace, $B$ is closed in $H$.

Since $A = H \setminus B$ and $B$ is closed in $H$, $A$ is open in $H$.

By the same argument with the roles of $A$ and $B$ reversed, $A$ is closed in $H$ and $B$ is open in $H$.
Hence the result.

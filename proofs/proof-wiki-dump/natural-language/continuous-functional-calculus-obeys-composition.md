Theorem
Let $\struct {A, \ast, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a unital $\text C^\ast$-algebra.
Let $x \in A$ be normal. 
Let $\map {\sigma_A} x$ denote the spectrum of $x$ in $A$.
Let $\map \CC {\map {\sigma_A} x}$ be the space of continuous functions on $\map {\sigma_A} x$.
Let $f \in \map \CC {\map {\sigma_A} x}$.
Let $g \in \map \CC {f \sqbrk {\map {\sigma_A} x} }$.
Let $\map {\Theta_x} {g \circ f} = \map {\paren {g \circ f} } x$ be the continuous functional calculus of $x$ applied to $g \circ f$.
Let $\map {\Theta_{\map f x} } g = \map g {\map f x}$ be the continuous functional calculus of $\map f x$ applied to $g$.

Then $\map {\paren {g \circ f} } x = \map g {\map f x}$.


Proof
Note from Existence and Uniqueness of Continuous Functional Calculus that $\map f x$ is normal.
From the Spectral Mapping Theorem, we have:

$f \sqbrk {\map {\sigma_A} x} = \map {\sigma_A} {\map f x}$
and hence $g \in \map \CC {\map {\sigma_A} {\map f x} }$.
We are hence assured that $\map g {\map f x}$ is well-defined.
Let $B \subseteq A$ be the $\text C^\ast$-algebra generated by $\set { {\mathbf 1}_A, x, x^\ast}$.
Let $C \subseteq A$ be the $\text C^\ast$-algebra generated by $\set { {\mathbf 1}_A, \map f x, \map f x^\ast}$.
From Existence and Uniqueness of Continuous Functional Calculus, we have $C \subseteq B$. 
By C*-Algebra Generated by Commutative Self-Adjoint Set is Commutative, $B$ and $C$ are commutative.
Let $\Phi_B$ and $\Phi_C$ be the spectrums of $B$ and $C$ respectively. 
Let $\phi \in \Phi_B$ so that $\phi \restriction C \in \Phi_C$.
We then have:














\(\ds \map \phi {\map {\paren {g \circ f} } x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\paren {g \circ f} } {\map \phi x}\)





Continuous Functional Calculus Commutes with Character on Generated C*-Subalgebra














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map g {\map f {\map \phi x} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map g {\map {\paren {\phi \restriction C} } {\map f x} }\)





since $\map f x \in C$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\paren {\phi \restriction C} } {\map g {\map f x} }\)





Continuous Functional Calculus Commutes with Character on Generated C*-Subalgebra














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \phi {\map g {\map f x} }\)









Hence we have:

$\widehat {\map {\paren {g \circ f} } x} = \widehat {\map g {\map f x} }$
where $\hat \cdot$ is the Gelfand transform.
From Gelfand-Naimark Theorem: Commutative Case, we therefore have:

$\map {\paren {g \circ f} } x = \map g {\map f x}$

Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a locally path-connected topological space.
Let $G$ be a path component of $T$.

Then $G$ is open in $T$.


Proof
By definition of locally path-connected, $T$ has a basis of path-connected set.
Thus $S$ is a union of open path-connected sets of $T$.
By Path Components are Open iff Union of Open Path-Connected Sets, the path components of $T$ are open in $T$.
$\blacksquare$

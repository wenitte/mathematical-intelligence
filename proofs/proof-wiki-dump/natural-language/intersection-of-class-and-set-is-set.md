Theorem
Let $C$ be the class:

$C = \set { u : \map \phi {u, p_1, \ldots, p_n} }$
Then for all sets $X$, $C \cap X$ is a set.

By the definition of class intersection:

$a \in C \cap X \implies a \in C \land a \in X$
Thus:

$a \in C \cap X \implies a \in X$
The subclass definition gives:

$C \cap X \subseteq X$
By Subclass of Set is Set, $C \cap X$ is a set.
$\blacksquare$

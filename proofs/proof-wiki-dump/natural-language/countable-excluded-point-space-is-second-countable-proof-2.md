Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_{\bar p} }$ be a countable excluded point space.

Then $T$ is a second-countable space.


Proof
We have:

Countable Discrete Space is Second-Countable
Excluded Point Topology is Open Extension Topology of Discrete Topology
The result follows from Condition for Open Extension Space to be Second-Countable.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ denote the position vectors of two points in space
Let $L$ be a straight line in space passing through $\mathbf a$ which is parallel to $\mathbf b$.
Let $\mathbf r$ be the position vector of an arbitrary point on $L$.

Then:

$\mathbf r = \mathbf a + t \mathbf b$
for some real number $t$, which may be positive or negative, or even $0$ if $\mathbf r = \mathbf a$.


Proof


Let $a$ and $b$ be points as given, with their position vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ respectively.
Let $P$ be an arbitrary point on the straight line $L$ passing through $\mathbf a$ which is parallel to $\mathbf b$.
By the parallel postulate, $L$ exists and is unique.
Let $\mathbf r$ be the position vector of $P$.
Let $\mathbf r = \mathbf a + \mathbf x$ for some $\mathbf x$.
Then we have:

$\mathbf x = \mathbf r - \mathbf a$
As $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf r$ are both on $L$, it follows that $\mathbf x$ is parallel to $\mathbf b$.
That is:

$\mathbf x = t \mathbf b$
for some real number $t$.
Hence the result.

Also presented as
The vector form of the equation of a straight line in space can be presented in the forms:

$\mathbf r = \mathbf a + t \paren {\mathbf b - \mathbf a}$
or:

$\paren {\mathbf r - \mathbf a} \times \paren {\mathbf b - \mathbf a} = \mathbf 0$
which is the same straight line.

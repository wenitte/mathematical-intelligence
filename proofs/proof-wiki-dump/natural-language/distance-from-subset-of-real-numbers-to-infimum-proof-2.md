Theorem
Let $S$ be a subset of the set of real numbers $\R$.
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number.
Let $\map d {x, S}$ be the distance between $x$ and $S$.

Let $S$ be bounded below such that $\xi = \inf S$.
Then:

$\map d {\xi, S} = 0$


Proof
Recall from Real Number Line is Metric Space that the set of real numbers $\R$ with the distance function $d$ is a metric space.
The result is then seen to be an example of Distance from Subset to Infimum.

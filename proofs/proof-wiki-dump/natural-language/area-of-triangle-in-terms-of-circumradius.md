Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle whose sides are $a$, $b$ and $c$ opposite vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively.

Then the area $\AA$ of $\triangle ABC$ is given by:

$\AA = \dfrac {a b c} {4 R}$
where $R$ is the circumradius of $\triangle ABC$.


Proof 1

Let $O$ be the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$.
Let $\AA$ be the area of $\triangle ABC$.
Let a perpendicular be dropped from $C$ to $AB$ at $E$.
Let $h := CE$.
Then:














\(\ds \AA\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {c h} 2\)

\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds h\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {2 \AA} c\)










Let a diameter $CD$ of the circumcircle be passed through $O$.
By definition of circumradius, $CD = 2 R$.
By Thales' Theorem, $\angle CAD$ is a right angle.
By Angles on Equal Arcs are Equal, $\angle ADC = \angle ABC$.
It follows from Sum of Angles of Triangle equals Two Right Angles that $\angle ACD = \angle ECB$.
Thus by Equiangular Triangles are Similar $\triangle DAC$ and $\triangle BEC$ are similar.

So:














\(\ds \frac {CA} {CD}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {CE} {CB}\)





$\triangle DAC$ and $\triangle BEC$ are similar








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac b {2 R}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac h a\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {2 \AA} {a c}\)





substituting for $h$ from $(1)$ above








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \AA\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {a b c} {4 R}\)









$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $k$ be a division ring.
Let $X$ be a set.
Let $k^{\paren X}$ be the free vector space on $X$.

The vector space $k^{\paren X}$ has dimension the cardinality of $X$.


Proof
Follows from:

Canonical Basis of Free Module on Set is Basis
Cardinality of Canonical Basis of Free Module on Set
$\blacksquare$

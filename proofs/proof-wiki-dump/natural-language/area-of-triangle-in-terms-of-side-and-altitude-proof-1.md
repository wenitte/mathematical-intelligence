Theorem
The area of a triangle $\triangle ABC$ is given by:

$\dfrac {c \cdot h_c} 2 = \dfrac {b \cdot h_b} 2 = \dfrac {a \cdot h_a} 2$
where:

$a, b, c$ are the sides
$h_a, h_b, h_c$ are the altitudes from $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively.


Proof

Construct a point $D$ so that $\Box ABDC$ is a parallelogram.
From Opposite Sides and Angles of Parallelogram are Equal:

$\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DCB$
hence their areas are equal.
The Area of Parallelogram is equal to the product of one of its bases and the associated altitude.
Thus 














\(\ds \paren {ABCD}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c \cdot h_c\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 \paren {ABC}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c \cdot h_c\)





because congruent surfaces have equal areas














\(\ds \paren {ABC}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {c \cdot h_c} 2\)









where $\paren {XYZ}$ is the area of the plane figure $XYZ$.

A similar argument can be used to show that the statement holds for the other sides.

Motivation
This formula is perhaps the best-known and most useful for determining a triangle's area.
It is usually remembered, and quoted, as half base times height.

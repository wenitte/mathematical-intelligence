Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

Parallelepidedal solids which are on the same base and of the same height, and in which the extremities of the sides which stand up are not on the same straight lines, are equal to one another.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XI}$: Proposition $30$)


Proof

Let $CM$ and $CN$ be parallelepipeds on the same base $AB$ and of the same height.
Let the endpoints of their vertical sides:

$AF, AG, LM, LN, CD, CE, BH, BK$
be not on the same straight lines.
It is to be demonstrated that the parallelepiped $CM$ is equal to the parallelepiped $CN$.

Let $NK$ and $DH$ be produced, and meet each other at $R$.
Let $FM$ and $GE$ be produced to $P$ and $Q$.
Let $AO, LP, CQ, BR$ be joined.
We have that $CM$ and $CP$ are on the same parallelogram $ABCL$ and of the same height, and the endpoints of their vertical sides:

$AF, AO, LM, LP, CD, CQ, BH, BR$
are on the same straight lines $FP$ and $FR$.
So from Proposition $29$ of Book $\text{XI} $: Parallelepipeds on Same Base and Same Height whose Extremities are on Same Lines are Equal in Volume:

the parallelepiped $CM$, of which the parallelogram $ABCL$ is the base and $FDHM$ the opposite
is equal to

the parallelepiped $CP$, of which the parallelogram $ABCL$ is the base and $OQRP$ the opposite.
But we also have that $CP$ and $CN$ are on the same parallelogram $ABCL$ and of the same height, and the endpoints of their vertical sides:

$AG, AO, LN, LP, CE, CQ, BK, BR$
are on the same straight lines $GQ$ and $NR$.
So from Proposition $29$ of Book $\text{XI} $: Parallelepipeds on Same Base and Same Height whose Extremities are on Same Lines are Equal in Volume:

the parallelepiped $CN$, of which the parallelogram $ABCL$ is the base and $ACBL$ the opposite
is equal to

the parallelepiped $CP$, of which the parallelogram $ABCL$ is the base and $OQRP$ the opposite.
Hence the parallelepiped $CM$ equals the parallelepiped $CN$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $30$ of Book $\text{XI}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

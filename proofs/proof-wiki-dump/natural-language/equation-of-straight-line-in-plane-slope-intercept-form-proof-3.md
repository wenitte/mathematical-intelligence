Theorem
Let $\LL$ be the straight line in the Cartesian plane such that:

the slope of $\LL$ is $m$
the $y$-intercept of $\LL$ is $c$

Then $\LL$ can be described by the equation:

$y = m x + c$

such that $m$ is the slope of $\LL$ and $c$ is the $y$-intercept.


Proof

Let the straight line $\LL$  make an angle $\psi$ with the $x$-axis.
The slope $m$ of $\LL$ is then given by:

$m = \tan \psi$
Let $B := \tuple {0, c}$ be the $y$-intercept of $\LL$.
Let $P := \tuple {x, y}$ be an arbitrary point on $\LL$.
Let the perpendicular $MP$ to the $x$-axis be constructed from $P$ to intersect the $x$-axis at $M$
Let $BK$ be constructed perpendicular $MP$ from $B$ to intersect $MP$ at $K$.
Then we have:

\(\ds y - c\)

\(\ds KP\)

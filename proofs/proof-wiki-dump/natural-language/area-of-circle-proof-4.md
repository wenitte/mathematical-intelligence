Theorem
The area $A$ of a circle is given by:

$A = \pi r^2$
where $r$ is the radius of the circle.


Proof

This needs considerable tedious hard slog to complete it.In particular: Add the required link to the demonstration that the small unit of area is $t \rd t \rd \theta$To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Finish}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

Expressing the area in polar coordinates:














\(\ds \iint \rd A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \int_0^r \int_0^{2 \pi} t \rd t \rd \theta\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \intlimits {\int_0^r t \theta} 0 {2 \pi} \rd t\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \int_0^r 2 \pi t \rd t\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \pi \paren {\intlimits {\frac 1 2 t^2} 0 r}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \pi \paren {\frac 1 2 r^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \pi r^2\)

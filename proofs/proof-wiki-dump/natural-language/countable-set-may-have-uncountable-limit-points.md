Theorem
Let $S$ be an uncountable set.
Let $H \subseteq S$ be a countable subset of $S$.
Let $T = \struct {H, \tau}$ be a topological space on the underlying set $H$.

Then despite the fact that $H$ is countable, the set of limit points of $T$ may be uncountable.


Proof
Let $\R$ be the set of real numbers.
Let $\Q$ be the set of rational numbers.
Let $x \in \R$.
Then from Real Number is Limit Point of Rational Numbers in Real Numbers, $x$ is a limit point of $T$.
As $x$ is arbitrary, it follows that every element of $\R$ is a limit point of $T$.
From Rational Numbers are Countably Infinite, $\Q$ is a countable set.
From Real Numbers are Uncountable, $\R$ is an uncountable set.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

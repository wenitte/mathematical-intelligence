Theorem
$\map \sec {\dfrac \pi 2 - \theta} = \csc \theta$ for $\theta \ne n \pi$
where $\sec$ and $\csc$ are secant and cosecant respectively.

That is, the cosecant of an angle is the secant of its complement.
This relation is defined wherever $\sin \theta \ne 0$.


Proof













\(\ds \map \sec {\frac \pi 2 - \theta}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {\map \cos {\frac \pi 2 - \theta} }\)





Secant is Reciprocal of Cosine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {\sin \theta}\)





Cosine of Complement equals Sine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \csc \theta\)





Cosecant is Reciprocal of Sine




The above is valid only where $\sin \theta \ne 0$, as otherwise $\dfrac 1 {\sin \theta}$ is undefined.
From Sine of Multiple of Pi it follows that this happens when $\theta \ne n \pi$.
$\blacksquare$


Examples
Secant of $90 \degrees - 3 \theta$
$\map \cos {90 \degrees - 3 \theta} = \csc 3 \theta$

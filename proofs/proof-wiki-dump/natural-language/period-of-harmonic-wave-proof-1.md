Theorem
Let $\phi$ be a harmonic wave expressed as:

$\forall x, t \in \R: \map \phi {x, t} = a \map \cos {\omega \paren {x - c t} }$

The period $\tau$ of $\phi$ can be expressed as:

$\tau = \dfrac \lambda c$
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of $\phi$.


Proof
By definition, a harmonic wave is an instance of a periodic wave.
Hence Period of Periodic Wave can be used directly.
$\blacksquare$

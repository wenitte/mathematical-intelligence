Theorem
Let $\EE$ be an ellipsoid.
The minor axis of $\EE$ is an axis of symmetry of $\EE$.


Proof
Let us arrange $\EE$ such that the minor axis is aligned with the $x$-axis, say.

By Standard Equation of Ellipsoid, $\EE$ can be expressed by the equation:

$\dfrac {x^2} {a^2} + \dfrac {y^2} {b^2} + \dfrac {z^2} {c^2} = 1$
where $2 a$ is the length of the minor axis.

Let $R$ denote the space rotation of $180 \degrees$ about the $x$-axis, that is, the minor axis of $\EE$.
Then:

\(\ds \map R {\dfrac {x^2} {a^2} + \dfrac {y^2} {b^2} + \dfrac {z^2} {c^2} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {x^2} {a^2} + \dfrac {\paren {-y}^2} {b^2} + \dfrac {\paren {-z}^2} {c^2}\)





Space Rotation through Straight Angle about X-Axis














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {x^2} {a^2} + \dfrac {y^2} {b^2} + \dfrac {z^2} {c^2}\)









Hence $R$ is demonstrated to be a symmetry, and the result follows.

Theorem
Then there are infinitely many ways to express the number $1$ in the golden mean number system.


Proof
We have that:

$\phi^0 = 1$
and so $1$ has the representation $S_1$ as:

$S_1 := \left[{1 \cdotp 00}\right]_\phi$
By inspection it is seen that $S_1$ is the simplest form of $1$.
Expanding $S_1$:

$S_2 := \left[{0 \cdotp 11}\right]_\phi$
which can then be expressed as:

$S_2 := \left[{0 \cdotp 1100}\right]_\phi$
Expanding $S_2$:

$S_3 := \left[{0 \cdotp 1011}\right]_\phi$
and so:

$S_4 := \left[{0 \cdotp 101011}\right]_\phi$
Continuing in this way we obtain an infinite sequence $\left\langle{S_n}\right\rangle$ all of which are a representation of $1$.
$\blacksquare$


Examples
Example: $0 \cdotp 11$
$1$ can be represented in the golden mean number system as $\sqbrk {0 \cdotp 11}_\phi$.


Example: $0 \cdotp 01111 \ldots$
$1$ can be represented in the golden mean number system as $\left[{0 \cdotp 01111 \ldots}\right]_\phi$.

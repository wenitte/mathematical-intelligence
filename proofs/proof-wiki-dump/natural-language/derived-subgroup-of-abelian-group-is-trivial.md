Theorem
Let $G$ be a abelian group with identity $e$.
Let $G'$ be the derived subgroup of $G$.

Then $G'$ is the trivial group $\set e$.


Proof
For $g, h \in G$, let $\sqbrk {g, h}$ denote the commutator of $g$ and $h$:

$\sqbrk {g, h} := g^{-1} \circ h^{-1} \circ g \circ h$
Let $C$ be the set of the commutators of $G$:

$C = \set {\sqbrk {g, h}: g, h \in G}$

From Commutators are Identity iff Group is Abelian, $C = \set e$.
From Trivial Subgroup is Subgroup, $C = \set e$ is a subgroup of $G$.
From Subgroup Generated by Subgroup:

$\gen C = C$
where $\gen C$ denotes the subgroup generated by $C$.
From the definition of derived subgroup:

$G' := \gen C$
Hence the result:

$G' = \set e$
$\blacksquare$

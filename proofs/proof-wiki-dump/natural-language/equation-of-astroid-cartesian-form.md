Theorem
Let $H$ be the astroid generated by the epicycle $C_1$ of radius $b$ rolling without slipping around the inside of a deferent $C_2$ of radius $a = 4 b$.
Let $C_2$ be embedded in a cartesian plane with its center $O$ located at the origin.
Let $P$ be a point on the circumference of $C_1$.
Let $C_1$ be initially positioned so that $P$ is its point of tangency to $C_2$, located at point $A = \tuple {a, 0}$ on the $x$-axis.

Let $\tuple {x, y}$ be the coordinates of $P$ as it travels over the plane.

The point $P = \tuple {x, y}$ is described by the equation:

$x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = a^{2/3}$


Proof
By definition, an astroid is a hypocycloid with $4$ cusps.




From the parametric form of the equation of an astroid, $H$ can be expressed as:

$\begin{cases}
x & = 4 b \cos^3 \theta = a \cos^3 \theta \\
y & = 4 b \sin^3 \theta = a \sin^3 \theta
\end{cases}$

Squaring, taking cube roots and adding:














\(\ds x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{2/3} \paren {\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{2/3}\)

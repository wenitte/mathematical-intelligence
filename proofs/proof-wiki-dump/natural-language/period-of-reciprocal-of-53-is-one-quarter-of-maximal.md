Theorem
The decimal expansion of the reciprocal of $53$ has $\dfrac 1 4$ the maximum period, that is: $13$:

$\dfrac 1 {53} = 0 \cdotp \dot 01886 \, 79245 \, 28 \dot 3$


Proof
From Reciprocal of $53$:

$\dfrac 1 {53} = 0 \cdotp \dot 01886 \, 79245 \, 28 \dot 3$
Counting the digits, it is seen that this has a period of recurrence of $13$.

From Maximum Period of Reciprocal of Prime, the maximum period of recurrence of $\dfrac 1 p$ is $p - 1$.
We have that:

$13 = \dfrac {53 - 1} 4$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

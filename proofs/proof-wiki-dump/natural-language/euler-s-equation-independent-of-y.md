Theorem
Let $y$ be a mapping.
Let $J$ a functional be such that

$\ds J \sqbrk y = \int_a^b \map F {x,y} \rd x$

Then the corresponding Euler's Equation can be reduced to:

$F_y = 0$
Furthermore, this is an algebraic equation.


Proof
Assume that:

$\ds J \sqbrk y = \int_a^b \map F {x,y} \rd x$
Then Euler's Equation for $J$ is:

$F_y = 0$
Since $F$ is independent of $y'$, the equation is algebraic.
$\blacksquare$

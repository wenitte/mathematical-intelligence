Theorem
Let $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ be a Division Ring whose zero is $0$.
Let $\struct {J, +, \circ}$ be a maximal ideal of $D$.

Then:

$J = \set 0$


Proof
From Ideals of Division Ring, the only ideals of a Division Ring $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ are $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ and $\struct {\set 0, +, \circ}$.

Hence the result by definition of maximal ideal.
$\blacksquare$

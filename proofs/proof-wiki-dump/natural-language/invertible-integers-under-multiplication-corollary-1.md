Corollary to Invertible Integers under Multiplication
Let $a, b \in \Z$ such that $a b = 1$.
Then $a = b = \pm 1$.


Proof
Let $a b = 1$.
From Integer Multiplication Identity is One, $1$ is the identity element for $\Z$.
Then, by definition, both $a$ and $b$ are invertible elements of $\Z$ for multiplication.
So by Invertible Integers under Multiplication, $a = \pm 1$ and $b = \pm 1$.
As $-1 \times 1 = -1$, it follows that either:

$a = b = 1$
or

$a = b = -1$.

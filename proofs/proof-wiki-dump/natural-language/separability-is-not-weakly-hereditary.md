Theorem
The property of separability is not weakly hereditary.


Proof
It needs to be demonstrated that there exists a separable topological space which has a subspace which is closed but not separable.

Consider an uncountable particular point space $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$.
From Particular Point Space is Separable, $T$ is separable.
By definition, the particular point $p$ is an open point of $T$.
Thus the subset $S \setminus \set p$ is by definition closed in $T$.
But from Separability in Uncountable Particular Point Space, $S \setminus \set p$ is not separable.

Thus by Proof by Counterexample, separability is not weakly hereditary.
$\blacksquare$

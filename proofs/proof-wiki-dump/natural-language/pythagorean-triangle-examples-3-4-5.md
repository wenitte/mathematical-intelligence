Example of Primitive Pythagorean Triangle
The triangle whose sides are of length $3$, $4$ and $5$ is a primitive Pythagorean triangle.





Proof













\(\ds 3^2 + 4^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 + 16\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5^2\)









It follows by Pythagoras's Theorem that $3$, $4$ and $5$ form a Pythagorean triple.

Note that $3$ and $4$ are coprime.
Hence, by definition, $3$, $4$ and $5$ form a primitive Pythagorean triple.
The result follows by definition of a primitive Pythagorean triangle.
$\blacksquare$

Historical Note
To the Pythagoreans, the $3-4-5$ triangle had particular significance: the sides of lengths $3$ and $4$ denoted the male and female principles, while the hypotenuse of length $5$ denoted their offspring.

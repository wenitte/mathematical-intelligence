Theorem
Let $S$ and $T$ be sets.
Let:

$f \sqbrk S \cap f \sqbrk T = \O$
where $f \sqbrk S$ denotes the image set of $S$.

Then:

$S \cap T = \O$


Proof
From Image of Intersection under Mapping:

$f \sqbrk {S \cap T} \subseteq f \sqbrk S \cap f \sqbrk T$
From Empty Set is Subset of All Sets:

$f \sqbrk {S \cap T} = \O$
From Image of Subset under Mapping is Subset of Image:

$S \cap T = \O$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ and $\struct {H, *}$ be groups.
Let $\phi: \struct {G, \circ} \to \struct {H, *}$ be a group homomorphism.
Let:

$e_G$ be the identity of $G$
$e_H$ be the identity of $H$.

Then:

$\map \phi {e_G} = e_H$


Proof
A direct application of Homomorphism to Group Preserves Identity.
$\blacksquare$

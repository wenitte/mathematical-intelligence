This page has been identified as a candidate for refactoring.In particular: Expand the context so as to place the vectors in a general vector space, not just $\R^n$.Until this has been finished, please leave {{Refactor}} in the code.
New contributors: Refactoring is a task which is expected to be undertaken by experienced editors only.

Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.
Theorem
$\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u = 0 \iff \mathbf u = \mathbf 0$


Proof













\(\ds \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds \sum_{i \mathop = 1}^n u_i^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)

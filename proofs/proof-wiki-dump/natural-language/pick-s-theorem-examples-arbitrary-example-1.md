Example of Use of Pick's Theorem
Consider the following polygon $P$ embedded in an integer lattice:


The area of $P$ is $4$.


Proof
The number $l$ of interior lattice points of $P$ is $2$.
The number $b$ of boundary lattice points of $P$ is $6$.
Hence the area $A$ of $P$ is given by Pick's Theorem as:














\(\ds A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds l + \dfrac b 2 - 1\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 + \dfrac 6 2 - 1\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4\)









$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \NN}$ be a neighborhood space.
Then the empty set $\O$ is an open set of $\struct {S, \NN}$.


Proof
Suppose $\O$ were not an open set of $\struct {S, \NN}$.
Then $\exists x \in \O$ such that $\O$ is not a neighborhood of $\O$.
By definition of empty set, such an $x$ does not exist.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

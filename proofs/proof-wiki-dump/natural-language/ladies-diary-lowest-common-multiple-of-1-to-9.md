Puzzle
What is the least number which will divide by the nine digits without leaving a remainder?


Solution
$2520$.


Proof
This is the same as asking:

What is the lowest common multiple of $\set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}$?
This must be $5 \times 7 \times 8 \times 9$ which is $2520$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a finite set.
Let $\rightarrow$ denote the right operation on $S$.

The Cayley table of the algebraic structure $\struct {S, \rightarrow}$ is characterised by the fact that each column contains just one distinct element.


Proof
A column of a Cayley table headed by $y$ contains all those elements of the form $x \rightarrow y$.
By definition of the right operation:

$x \rightarrow y = y$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

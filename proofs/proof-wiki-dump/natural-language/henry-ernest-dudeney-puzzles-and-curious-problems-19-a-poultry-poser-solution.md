Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $19$
A Poultry Poser
Three chickens and one duck sold for as much as two geese;
one chicken, two ducks, and three geese were sold together for $25 \shillings$
What was the price of each bird in an exact number of shillings?


Solution
A chicken costs $2 \shillings$, a duck costs $4 \shillings$ and a goose costs $5 \shillings$


Proof
Let $c$, $d$ and $g$ be the price in shillings for one chicken, one duck and one goose respectively.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 3 c + d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 g\)





Three chickens and one duck sold for as much as two geese;




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds c + 2 d + 3 g\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25\)





one chicken, two ducks, and three geese were sold together for $25 \shillings$.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 g - 3 c\)





rearranging $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds c + 2 \paren {2 g - 3 c} + 3 g\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25\)





substituting for $d$ in $(2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 7 g\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 \paren {c + 5}\)





simplifying



It follows that $g$ is a multiple of $5$.
If $g \ge 10$ we have from $(2)$ that $c + 2 d < 0$ which cannot happen.
Hence $g = 5$ and so:




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 3 c + d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)





substituting $g = 5$ in $(1)$




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)









\(\ds c + 2 d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)





substituting $g = 5$ in $(2)$ and simplifying




\(\text {(5)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 c + 2 d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)





$(3) \times 2$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)





$(1) - (2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 3 \times 2 + d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4\)

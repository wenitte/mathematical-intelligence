Theorem
Let $n \in \N$ be a natural number.
Then $n$ is an ordinal.


Proof
Consider the class of all ordinals $\On$.
From Class of All Ordinals is Minimally Superinductive over Successor Mapping, $\On$ is superinductive.
Hence a fortiori $\On$ is inductive.
From the von Neumann construction of the natural numbers, $\N$ is identified with the minimally inductive set $\omega$.
By definition of minimally inductive set:

$\omega \subseteq \On$
and the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

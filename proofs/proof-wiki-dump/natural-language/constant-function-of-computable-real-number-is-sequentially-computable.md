Theorem
Let $c \in \R$ be a computable real number.
Then, $fÂ : \R^n \to \R$, defined as:

$\map f \bsx = c$
is sequentially computable.


Proof
For any real sequence $\sequence {x_n}$, we have:

$\sequence {\map f {x_n}} = \sequence c$
Thus, the result follows from Constant Sequence of Computable Real Number is Computable.

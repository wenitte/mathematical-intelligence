Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a particular point space.
Let $x \in S$ such that $x \ne p$.
Let $H \subseteq S$ such that $p \in H$.

Then $x$ is not an $\omega$-accumulation point of $H$.


Proof
Let $x \in S, x \ne p$.
By Limit Points in Particular Point Space, $x$ is a ‎limit point of $H$.
Consider the set $U = \set {x, p} \subseteq S$.
By definition of the particular point topology, $U$ is open in $T$.
But as $U$ contains only $x$ and $p$, it is clear that $U$ does not contain an infinite number of points of $H$.
Hence, by definition, $x$ can not be an $\omega$-accumulation point of $H$.
$\blacksquare$

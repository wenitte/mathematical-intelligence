Examples of Lattice in context of Ordered Sets
Let $\struct {\Z_{>0}, \divides}$ denote the order structure consisting of the (strictly) positive integers under the divisor relation $\divides$.
Then $\struct {\Z_{>0}, \divides}$ is a lattice.


Proof
Let $a, b \in \Z_{>0}$.
Let $\gcd \set {a, b}$ denote the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$.
Let $\lcm \set {a, b}$ denote the lowest common multiple of $a$ and $b$.
By definition:

the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the infimum of $a$ and $b$ with respect to the divisor relation.
the lowest common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is the supremum of $a$ and $b$ with respect to the divisor relation.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

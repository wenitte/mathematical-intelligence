Theorem
Let $\mathbf u$ be a vector in the real Euclidean space $\R^n$.
Then:

$\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u = \norm {\mathbf u}^2$
where $\norm {\mathbf u}$ is the length of $\mathbf u$.


Proof 1
Let $\mathbf u = \tuple {u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n}$.
Then:














\(\ds \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u\)

\(=\)







\(\ds u_1 u_1 + u_2 u_2 + \cdots + u_n u_n\)





Definition of Dot Product














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds {u_1}^2 + {u_2}^2 + \cdots + {u_n}^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\sqrt {\sum_{i \mathop = 1}^n {u_i}^2} }^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \norm {\mathbf u}^2\)





Definition of Vector Length in $\R^n$

Proof 2













\(\ds \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \norm {\mathbf u} \norm {\mathbf u} \cos \angle \mathbf u, \mathbf u\)





Cosine Formula for Dot Product














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \norm {\mathbf u}^2 \cos 0\)





since the angle between a vector and itself is $0$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \norm {\mathbf u}^2\)





Cosine of Zero is One



$\blacksquare$


Also presented as
This can also be seen presented as:

$\norm {\mathbf u} = \paren {\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u}^{1/2}$
or:

$\norm {\mathbf u} = u = \sqrt {\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u}$
and so on.

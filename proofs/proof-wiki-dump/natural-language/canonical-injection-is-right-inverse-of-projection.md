Theorem
Let $\struct {G_1, \circ_1}$ and $\struct {G_2, \circ_2}$ be groups with identity elements $e_1$ and $e_2$ respectively.
Let $\struct {G_1 \times G_2, \circ}$ be the group direct product of $\struct {G_1, \circ_1}$ and $\struct {G_2, \circ_2}$

Let:

$\pr_1: \struct {G_1 \times G_2, \circ} \to \struct {G_1, \circ_1}$ be the first projection from $\struct {G_1 \times G_2, \circ}$ to $\struct {G_1, \circ_1}$
$\pr_2: \struct {G_1 \times G_2, \circ} \to \struct {G_2, \circ_2}$ be the second projection from $\struct {G_1 \times G_2, \circ}$ to $\struct {G_2, \circ_2}$.

Let:

$\inj_1: \struct {G_1, \circ_1} \to \struct {G_1 \times G_2, \circ}$ be the canonical injection from $\struct {G_1, \circ_1}$ to $\struct {G_1 \times G_2, \circ}$
$\inj_2: \struct {G_2, \circ_2} \to \struct {G_1 \times G_2, \circ}$ be the canonical injection from $\struct {G_2, \circ_2}$ to $\struct {G_1 \times G_2, \circ}$.

Then:

$(1): \quad \pr_1 \circ \inj_1 = I_{G_1}$
$(2): \quad \pr_2 \circ \inj_2 = I_{G_2}$
where $I_{G_1}$ and $I_{G_2}$ are the identity mappings on $G_1$ and $G_2$ respectively.


Proof
This is a specific instance of External Direct Product of Projection with Canonical Injection, where the algebraic structures in question are groups.

Theorem
Let $\Q$ be the set of rational numbers.
Let $\struct {\R, \tau}$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.

Then $\Q$ is a $F_\sigma$ set in $\R$.


Proof
Let $\alpha \in \Q$ be a rational number.
From Real Number is Closed in Real Number Line, $\set \alpha$ is a closed set of $\R$.
From Rational Numbers are Countably Infinite, $\ds \bigcup_{\alpha \mathop \in \Q} \set \alpha$ is a countable union.
Thus $\Q = \ds \bigcup_{\alpha \mathop \in \Q} \set \alpha$ is a countable union of closed sets of $\R$.
Hence the result by definition of $F_\sigma$ set.
$\blacksquare$

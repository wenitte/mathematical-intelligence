Theorem
Let $G$ be a cyclic group of order $n$ generated by $a$.
Let $S = \set {m \in \Z_{>0}: m \divides n}$ be the set of all divisors of $n$.
Let $T$ be the set of all subgroups of $G$

Let $\phi: S \to T$ be the mapping defined as:

$\phi: m \to \gen {a^{n / m} }$
where $\gen {a^{n / m} }$ is the subgroup generated by $a^{n / m}$.

Then $\phi$ is a bijection.


Proof
From Subgroup of Finite Cyclic Group is Determined by Order, there exists exactly one subgroup $\gen {a^{n / m} }$ of $G$ with $a$ elements.
So the mapping as defined is indeed a bijection by definition.
$\blacksquare$

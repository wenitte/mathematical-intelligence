Theorem
Let $\Box ABCD$ be a trapezium such that $AB$ and $DC$ are the parallel sides.


Let $E$ be the midpoint of $AD$.
Let $F$ lie on $BC$.

Let $EF$ be parallel to both $AB$ and $DC$.
Then $F$ is the midpoint of $BC$.


Proof

Let $DH$ be constructed parallel to $BC$ to cut $AB$ at $H$.
From the Parallel Transversal Theorem:

$DG : GH = DE : EA$
and so $G$ is the midpoint of $AH$.
That is:

$(1): \quad DG = GH$

Then we have that:

$DC$ is parallel to $GF$
and:

$DG$ is parallel to $CF$
so, by definition, $\Box GFCD$ is a parallelogram.
Similarly, we have:

$GF$ is parallel to $HB$
and:

$GH$ is parallel to $FB$
so, by definition, $\Box GFBH$ is also a parallelogram.
By Opposite Sides and Angles of Parallelogram are Equal we have that:

$CF = DG$
and:

$GH = FB$
But from $(1)$:

$DG = GH$
and so:

$CF = FB$
and so $F$ is the midpoint of $CB$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Then there exists at least one subset of $S$ which is not an element of $S$.


Proof
Consider the power set $\powerset S$ of $S$.
From Cantor's Theorem, there is no surjection $f: S \to \powerset S$.
That is, there are more subsets of $S$ than there are elements of $S$.
So there must be at least one subset of $S$ which is not an element of $S$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\R$ be the set of real numbers considered as an Euclidean space.
Let $S \subseteq \R$ be non-closed in $\R$.

Then $S$ is not a compact subspace of $\R$.


Proof
From:

Real Number Line is Metric Space
Metric Space is Hausdorff
Compact Subspace of Hausdorff Space is Closed
the result follows by the rule of transposition.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Use of Number of Ways of Seating People at Circular Table
$8$ people can be seated at a circular table in $5040$ ways.


Proof
From Number of Ways of Seating People at Circular Table, $n$ people can be so seated in $\paren {n - 1}!$ ways, where $!$ denotes the factorial function.
Hence $8$ people can be seated at a circular table in $\paren {8 - 1}! = 5040$ ways.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Every homogeneous system of linear equations has the zero vector as a solution.


Corollary
Every homogeneous system of linear equations is consistent.


Proof
By the definition of null space, $\mathbf 0$ is a solution if and only if the null space contains the zero vector.
The result follows from Null Space Contains Zero Vector.

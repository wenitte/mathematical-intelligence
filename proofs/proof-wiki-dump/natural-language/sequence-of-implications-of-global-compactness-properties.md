Theorem
Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be compactness properties and let:

$P_1 \implies P_2$
mean:

If a topological space $T$ satsifies property $P_1$, then $T$ also satisfies property $P_2$.

Then the following sequence of implications holds:











Sequentially Compact















$\Big\Downarrow$









Compact


$\implies$


Countably Compact


$\implies$


Pseudocompact



$\Big\Downarrow$





$\Big\Downarrow$









$\sigma$-Compact





Weakly Countably Compact









$\Big\Downarrow$















Lindelöf Space
















Proof
The relevant justifications are listed as follows:

Sequentially Compact Space is Countably Compact.
Compact Space is Countably Compact.
Compact Space is $\sigma$-Compact.
$\sigma$-Compact Space is Lindelöf.
Countably Compact Space is Weakly Countably Compact.
Countably Compact Space is Pseudocompact.
$\blacksquare$

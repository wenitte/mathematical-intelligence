Theorem
Let $P$ be a Platonic solid.
Then $P$ is also uniform.


Proof
Recall the definition of Uniform Polyhedron:
A uniform polyhedron is a polyhedron:

$(1): \quad$ which is isogonal
$(2): \quad$ whose faces are all regular polygons (but not necessarily all of the same type).

Recall the definition of Platonic Solid:
A platonic solid is a convex polyhedron:

$(1): \quad$ whose faces are congruent regular polygons
$(2): \quad$ each of whose vertices is the common vertex of the same number of faces.

From Platonic Solid is Isogonal, $P$ is isogonal.
That all the faces are regular polygons follows a fortiori.
Hence the result.

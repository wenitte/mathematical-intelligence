Theorem
Let $\map \BB {S, \tau}$ be a Borel $\sigma$-algebra generated by the set of open sets in $S$.

Then $\map \BB {S, \tau}$ is equivalently generated by the set of closed sets in $S$.


Proof
By definition, a closed set is the relative complement of an open set.
The result follows from Sigma-Algebra Generated by Complements of Generators.

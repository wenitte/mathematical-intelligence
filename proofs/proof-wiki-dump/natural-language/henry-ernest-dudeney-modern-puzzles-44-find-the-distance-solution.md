Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $44$
Find the Distance
A man named Jones set out to walk from $A$ to $B$,
and on the road he met his friend Kenward, $10$ miles from $A$, who had left $B$ at exactly the same time.
Jones executed his commission at $B$ and, without delay, set out on his return journey,
while Kenward as promptly returned from $A$ to $B$.
They met $12$ miles from $B$.
Of course, each walked at a uniform rate throughout.
Now, how far is $A$ from $B$?


Solution
$18$ miles.

The "absurdly simple" rule being referred to by Dudeney:

$3$ times the distance from $A$ that they first cross minus the distance from $B$ when they cross for the second time.


Proof
Let $d$ miles be the distance between $A$ and $B$.
Let $V_J$ and $V_K$ miles per hour be the speeds of Jones and Kenward respectively.
Then we have:














\(\ds \dfrac {10} {V_J}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {d - 10} {V_K}\)





on the road he met his friend Kenward, $10$ miles from $A$














\(\ds \dfrac {d + 12} {V_J}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 d - 12} {V_K}\)





They met $12$ miles from $B$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds V_J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {10 V_K} {d - 10}\)




















\(\ds V_K \dfrac {d + 12} {2 d - 12}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds V_J\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {10 V_K} {d - 10}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {d + 12} \paren {d - 10}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10 \paren {2 d - 12}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d^2 + 2 d - 120\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20 d - 120\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d^2 - 18 d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d \paren {d - 18}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 18\)





as $d = 0$ is not a valid answer



$\Box$

For the general case, let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be the distances from $A$ and $B$ that they crossed respectively.
We have:














\(\ds \dfrac {d_1} {V_J}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {d - d_1} {V_K}\)




















\(\ds \dfrac {d + d_2} {V_J}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 d - d_2} {V_K}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds V_J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {d_1 V_K} {d - d_1}\)




















\(\ds V_K \dfrac {d + d_2} {2 d - d_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds V_J\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {d_1 V_K} {d - d_1}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {d + d_2} \paren {d - d_1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds d_1 \paren {2 d - d_2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d^2 + \paren {d_2 - d_1} d - d_1 d_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 d_1 d - d_1 d_2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d^2 - \paren {3 d_1 - d_2} d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d \paren {d - \paren {3 d_1 - d_2} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 d_1 - d_2\)





as $d = 0$ is not a valid answer



So the general rule is: 

$d = 3 d_1 - d_2$
$\blacksquare$

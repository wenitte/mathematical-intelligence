Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, \leqslant}$ be the ordered structure consisting of the real numbers under the usual ordering.
Then $\struct {\R, \leqslant}$ is not a well-ordered set.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample
Consider the set:

$A := \set {x \in \R: x > 1}$
Suppose $a$ were the smallest element of $A$.
Then $a > 1$.
But then:

$1 < \dfrac {a + 1} 2 < a$
and so $a$ has been shown not to be the smallest element of $A$ after all.
Hence $A$ has no smallest element.
Thus there exists a subset of $\R$ which has no smallest element.
Thus $\R$ is not a well-ordered under $\leqslant$.
$\blacksquare$

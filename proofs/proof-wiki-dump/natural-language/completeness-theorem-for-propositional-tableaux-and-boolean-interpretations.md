Theorem
Tableau proofs (in terms of propositional tableaux) are a complete proof system for boolean interpretations.
That is, for every WFF $\mathbf A$:

$\models_{\mathrm{BI} } \mathbf A$ implies $\vdash_{\mathrm{PT} } \mathbf A$


Proof
This is a corollary of the Extended Completeness Theorem for Propositional Tableaux and Boolean Interpretations.
Namely, it is the special case $\mathbf H = \O$.

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Also see
The Soundness Theorem for Propositional Tableaux and Boolean Interpretations in which it is proved that:

If $\vdash \mathbf A$ then $\models \mathbf A$.

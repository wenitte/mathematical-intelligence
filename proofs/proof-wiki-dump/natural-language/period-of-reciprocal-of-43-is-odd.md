Theorem
The decimal expansion of the reciprocal of $43$ has an odd period, that is, $21$:

$\dfrac 1 {43} = 0 \cdotp \dot 02325 \, 58139 \, 53488 \, 37209 \, \dot 3$


Proof
From Reciprocal of $43$:

$\dfrac 1 {43} = 0 \cdotp \dot 02325 \, 58139 \, 53488 \, 37209 \, \dot 3$
Counting the digits, it is seen that this has a period of recurrence of $21$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

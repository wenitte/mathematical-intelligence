Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is locally connected.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $T$ is also a connected space.


Proof
Let $T$ be a discrete topological space with more than $1$ point.
From Discrete Space is Locally Connected, $T$ is a locally connected space.
From Non-Trivial Discrete Space is not Connected, $T$ is not a connected space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

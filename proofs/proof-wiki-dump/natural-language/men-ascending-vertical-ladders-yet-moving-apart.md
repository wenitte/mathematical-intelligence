Problem
$2$ men each ascend a vertical ladder, at the same speed, and yet they get further apart.
Explain.


Solution 1
The men are at the center of the Earth, ascending in opposite directions.
$\blacksquare$


Solution 2
To a first approximation, Earth is a sphere.
So, anywhere you place $2$ vertical ladders, their upper ends will be further apart from their lower ends.
Hence the ladders may be anywhere on the surface of the Earth.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This puzzle is typical of those found in collections of Victorian amusements.

Theorem
Let $A$ and $B$ be classes.
Then:

$\forall A, B: \paren {A \in B \iff \exists x: \paren {A = x \land x \in B} }$
where $x$ is specifically a set.


Proof
Let $V$ denote the universal class.
By Class is Subclass of Universal Class, $A \subseteq V$ and $B \subseteq V$.
By definition of universal class, every element of $V$ is a set.
Hence every element of $B$ is a set.
So if $A \in B$, then it follows that $A$ is itself a set.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

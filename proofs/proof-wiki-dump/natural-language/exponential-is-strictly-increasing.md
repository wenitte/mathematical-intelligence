Theorem
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number.
Let $\exp x$ be the exponential of $x$.

Then:

The function $\map f x = \exp x$ is strictly increasing.


Proof 1
By definition, the exponential function is the inverse of the natural logarithm function.
From Logarithm is Strictly Increasing, $\ln x$ is strictly increasing.
The result follows from Inverse of Strictly Monotone Function.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
For all $x \in \R$:














\(\ds D_x \exp x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \exp x\)





Derivative of Exponential Function














\(\ds \)

\(>\)







\(\ds 0\)





Exponential of Real Number is Strictly Positive




Hence the result, from Derivative of Monotone Function.
$\blacksquare$

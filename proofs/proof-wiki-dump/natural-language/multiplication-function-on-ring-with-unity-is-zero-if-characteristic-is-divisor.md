Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a ring with unity whose zero is $0_R$ and whose unity is $1_R$.
Let the characteristic of $R$ be $p$.
Let $g_a: \Z \to R$ be the mapping from the integers into $R$ defined as:

$\forall n \in \Z:\forall a \in R: \map {g_a} n = n \cdot a$
where $\cdot$ denotes the multiple operation.

Then:

$p \divides n \implies n \cdot a = 0_R$
where $p \divides n$ denotes that $p$ is a divisor of $n$.


Proof
Let $p > 0$.
From Principal Ideal of Characteristic of Ring is Subset of Kernel of Multiple Function:

$\ideal p \subseteq \map \ker {g_a}$
where:

$\map \ker {g_a}$ is the kernel of $g_a$
$\ideal p$ is the principal ideal of $\Z$ generated by $p$.

We have:

Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.

The perpendicular bisectors of $AB$, $BC$ and $AC$ all intersect at the same point.


Proof
Let the perpendicular bisectors of $AC$ and $AB$ be constructed through $D$ and $E$ respectively to meet at $F$.




By definition of perpendicular bisector:

$AE = EB$
and:

$\angle AEF = \angle BEF$ are right angles.
From Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence:

$\triangle AEF = \triangle BEF$
and so $AF = BF$.

Similarly, by definition of perpendicular bisector:

$AD = DC$
and:

$\angle ADF = \angle CDF$ are right angles.
From Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence:

$\triangle ADF = \triangle CDF$
and so $AF = CF$.
Thus:

$BF = CF$

Let $FG$ be the angle bisector of $\angle BFC$.
We have:

$BF = CF$ from above
and:

$\angle BFG = \angle CFG$ by construction
Thus by Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence:

$\triangle BFG = \triangle CFG$
and so $BG = CG$.
Thus as $\angle BGF = \angle CGF$ it follows that they are both right angles.
Thus $FG$ is the perpendicular bisector of $BC$.
Thus we have all three perpendicular bisectors of the sides of $ABC$ meeting at the same point $G$.

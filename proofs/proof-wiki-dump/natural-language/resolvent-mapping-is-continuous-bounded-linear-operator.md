Theorem
Let $B$ be a Banach space.
Let $\mathfrak{L}(B, B)$ be the set of bounded linear operators from $B$ to itself.
Let $T \in \mathfrak{L}(B, B)$.
Let $\rho(T)$ be the resolvent set of $T$ in the complex plane.

Then the resolvent mapping $fÂ : \rho(T) \to \mathfrak{L}(B,B)$ given by:

$f(z) = (T - zI)^{-1}$
is continuous in the operator norm $\|\cdot\|_*$.


Proof
Pick $z\in\rho(T)$. Since $z\in\rho(T)$, the operator $R_z = (T - zI)^{-1}$ exists and has finite norm $C \geq 0$.
Since Resolvent Set is Open, $z+h\in\rho(T)$ for any $h\in \Bbb C$ smaller than some $\delta > 0$. For such $h$,

(1)



Consider $(I - hR_z)^{-1}$. Either $\|R_z\|_* = 0$ so that $\|hR_z\|_* = |h|\|R_z\|_* = 0$ (by Operator Norm is Norm) for all $h$, or else $\|hR_z\|_* < 1$ for $h < 1/\|R_z\|_*$. In either case, $\|hR_z\|_* < 1$ for all sufficiently small $h$.
Therefore, by Invertibility of Identity Minus Operator, for sufficiently small $h$ we have $(I - hR_z)^{-1} = I + hR_z + h^2R_z^2 + \ldots$. Substituting this into $(1)$, we get














\(\ds \norm{ f(z+h) - f(z) }_*\)

\(\leq\)







\(\ds C\norm{ hR_z + h^2R_z^2 + \ldots }_*\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds C\norm{hR_z (I + hR_z + h^2R_z^2 + \ldots) }_*\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\ds C\size{h}\norm{R_z}_*\norm{I + hR_z + h^2R_z^2 + \ldots }_*\)

\(\ds C^2\size{h} \sum_{n\in N} (\size{h}\norm{R_z})^n\)





by Triangle Inequality and Operator Norm on Banach Space is Submultiplicative again on each term














\(\ds \)

\(\leq\)







\(\ds 2C^2\size{h}\)









as long as $|h| \leq \frac{1}{2\norm{R_z}}$.
The expression on the right-hand side goes to zero as $h$ gets small. Therefore, taking limits, we get
$$
\lim_{h\to0} \norm{ f(z+h) - f(z) }_* = 0.
$$
This establishes continuity of $f$ at arbitrary $z\in\rho(T)$.

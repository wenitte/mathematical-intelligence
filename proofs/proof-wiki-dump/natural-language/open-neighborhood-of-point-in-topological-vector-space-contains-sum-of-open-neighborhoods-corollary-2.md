Corollary
Let $K \in \set {\R, \C}$.
Let $X$ be a topological vector space over $K$.
Let $W$ be an open neighborhood of ${\mathbf 0}_X$. 

Then there exists a balanced open neighborhood $U$ of ${\mathbf 0}_X$ such that: 

$U + U \subseteq W$


Proof
From Open Neighborhood of Point in Topological Vector Space contains Sum of Open Neighborhoods: Corollary, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of ${\mathbf 0}_X$ such that:

$V + V \subseteq W$
From Open Neighborhood of Origin in Topological Vector Space contains Balanced Open Neighborhood, there exists a balanced open neighborhood $U$ of ${\mathbf 0}_X$ such that $U \subseteq V$.
Then $U + U \subseteq V + V \subseteq W$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is second-countable.

Then $T$ is also first-countable.


Proof
By definition of second-countable space, there exists a countable analytic basis $\BB \subseteq \tau$.
Then each $x \in S$ has a countable local basis:

$\BB_xÂ := \set {U \in \BB: x \in U}$
$\blacksquare$

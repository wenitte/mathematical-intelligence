Theorem
The operation of addition on the set of integers $\Z$ is associative:

$\forall x, y, z \in \Z: x + \paren {y + z} = \paren {x + y} + z$


Proof
From the formal definition of integers, $\eqclass {a, b} {}$ is an equivalence class of ordered pairs of natural numbers.
From Integers under Addition form Abelian Group, the integers under addition form a group, from which associativity follows from Group Axiom $\text G 1$: Associativity.

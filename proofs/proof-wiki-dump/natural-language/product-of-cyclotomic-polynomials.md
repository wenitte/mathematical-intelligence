Theorem
Let $n > 0$ be a (strictly) positive integer.

Then:

$\ds \prod_{d \mathop \divides n} \map {\Phi_d} x = x^n - 1$
where:

$\map {\Phi_d} x$ denotes the $d$th cyclotomic polynomial
the product runs over all divisors of $n$.


Proof
From the Polynomial Factor Theorem and Complex Roots of Unity in Exponential Form:

$\ds x^n - 1 = \prod_\zeta \paren {x - \zeta}$
where the product runs over all complex $n$th roots of unity.
In the left hand side, each factor $x - \zeta$ appears exactly once, in the factorization of $\map {\Phi_d} x$ where $d$ is the order of $\zeta$.

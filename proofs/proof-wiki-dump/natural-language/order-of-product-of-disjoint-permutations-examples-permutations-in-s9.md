Example of Order of Product of Disjoint Permutations
Consider the permutation given in cycle notation as

$\rho = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 6 & 7 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 8 & 9 \end{pmatrix}$
Its order is given by:

$\order \rho = 12$


Proof
$\rho$ is the product of $3$ disjoint permutations, of orders $4$, $3$ and $2$.
From Order of Product of Disjoint Permutations:

$\order \rho = \lcm \set {4, 3, 2} = 12$
$\blacksquare$

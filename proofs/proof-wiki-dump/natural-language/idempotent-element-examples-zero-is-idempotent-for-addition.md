Example of Idempotent Element
$0$ is idempotent under the operation of addition in the set of integers $\Z$, but no other element of $\Z$ is so.


Proof
From Integers under Addition form Abelian Group, $\struct {\Z, +}$ forms an abelian group whose identity element is $0$.
The result follows from Identity is only Idempotent Element in Group.
$\blacksquare$

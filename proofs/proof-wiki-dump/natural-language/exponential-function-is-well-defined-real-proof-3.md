Theorem
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number.
Let $\exp x$ be the exponential of $x$.

Then $\exp x$ is well-defined.


Proof
This proof assumes the continuous extension definition of $\exp$.
Let $e$ denote Euler's number.
Let $f: \Q \to \R$ be the real-valued function defined as:

$f \left({r}\right) = e^r$
From Euler's Number to Rational Power permits Unique Continuous Extension, there exists a unique continuous extension of $f$ to $\R$.
Hence the result.

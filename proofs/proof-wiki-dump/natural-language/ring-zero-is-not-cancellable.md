Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a ring which is not null.
Let $0$ be the ring zero of $R$.

Then $0$ is not a cancellable element for the ring product $\circ$.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $0$ is cancellable.
Let $a, b \in R$ such that $a \ne b$.
By definition of ring zero:

$0 \circ a = 0 = 0 \circ b$
By our supposition that $0$ is cancellable:

$a = b$
The result follows by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

Examples of Use of Product Rule for Derivatives
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {2 a x e^{a x^2} } = 2 a e^{a x^2} \paren {1 + 2 a x^2}$


Proof
Let $u = 2 a x$.
Let $v = e^{a x^2}$.
Thus we have:

$y = u v$
and so:














\(\ds \dfrac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds v \dfrac {\d u} {\d x} + u \dfrac {\d v} {\d x}\)





Product Rule for Derivatives














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^{a x^2} \cdot 2 a + 2 a x \cdot \paren {2 a x e^{a x^2} }\)





Power Rule for Derivatives, Derivative of $e^{a x^2}$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 a e^{a x^2} \paren {1 + 2 a x^2}\)

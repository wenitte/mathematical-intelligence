Theorem
Let the Axiom of Choice be accepted.
Then Kuratowski's Lemma holds.


Proof
Recall Kuratowski's Lemma:
Let $S$ be a  set of sets which is closed under chain unions.
Then every element of $S$ is a subset of a maximal element of $S$ under the subset relation.

By the Axiom of Choice, there exists a choice function for $S$.
By Closed Set under Chain Unions with Choice Function is of Type $M$:

every element of $S$ is a subset of a maximal element of $S$ under the subset relation.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

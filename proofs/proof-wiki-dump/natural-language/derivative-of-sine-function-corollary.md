Corollary to Derivative of Sine Function
$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sin a x} = a \cos a x$


Proof













\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sin x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cos x\)





Derivative of $\sin x$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sin a x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \cos a x\)

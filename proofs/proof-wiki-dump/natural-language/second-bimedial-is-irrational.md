Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If two medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle be added together, the whole is irrational; and let it be called a second bimedial straight line.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $38$)


Proof

Let $AB$ and $BC$ be medial straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Let $AB$ and $BC$ contain a medial rectangle.
Let $DE$ be a rational straight line.
Using Proposition $45$ of Book $\text{I} $: Construction of Parallelogram in Given Angle equal to Given Polygon:

Let $DF$ be a parallelogram set out on $DE$ equal to the square on $AC$.
Let its breadth be $DG$.
From Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{II} $: Square of Sum:

$AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 + 2 \cdot AB \cdot BC$
Let $EH$ be a rectangle applied to $DE$ whose area equals $AB^2 + BC^2$.
The rectangle $HF$ which remains from $DF$ having had $EH$ removed is therefore equal to $2 \cdot AB \cdot BC$.
Since each of $AB$ and $BC$ are medial, both of $AB^2$ and $BC^2$ are also medial.
By hypothesis, $2 \cdot AB \cdot BC$ is also medial.
As:

$EH = AB^2 + BC^2$
and:

$FH = 2 \cdot AB \cdot BC$
each of the rectangles $EH$ and $FH$ is medial.
Each of $EH$ and $FH$ is applied to the rational straight line $DE$.
From Proposition $22$ of Book $\text{X} $: Square on Medial Straight Line:

Each of $DH$ and $HG$ is rational and incommensurable in length with $DE$.

We have that $AB$ is incommensurable in length with $BC$.
We also have that:

$AB : BC = AB^2 : AB \cdot BC$
So by Proposition $11$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Elements of Proportional Magnitudes:

$AB^2$ is incommensurable with $AB \cdot BC$.
But from Proposition $15$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Sum of Commensurable Magnitudes:

$AB^2 + BC^2$ is commensurable with $AB^2$
and from Proposition $15$ of Book $\text{X} $: Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable:

$2 \cdot AB \cdot BC$ is commensurable with $AB \cdot BC$.
Therefore from Proposition $13$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurable Magnitudes are Incommensurable with Same Magnitude:

$AB^2 + BC^2$ is incommensurable with $2 \cdot AB \cdot BC$.
But:

$EH = AB^2 + BC^2$
and:

$HF = 2 \cdot AB \cdot BC$
Therefore $EH$ is incommensurable with $HF$.
So from:

Proposition $1$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Areas of Triangles and Parallelograms Proportional to Base
and:

Proposition $11$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Elements of Proportional Magnitudes
it follows that $DH$ is incommensurable in length with $HG$.

Therefore $DH$ and $HG$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
By Proposition $11$ of Book $\text{X} $: Binomial is Irrational:

$DG$ is irrational.
But $DE$ is rational.
From Proposition $20$ of Book $\text{X} $: Quotient of Rationally Expressible Numbers is Rational:

The rectangle contained by an irrational and a rational straight line is irrational.
Therefore $DF$ is irrational.
From Book $\text{X}$ Definition $4$: Rational Area:

The side of a square equal to an irrational area is irrational.
But $AC$ is the side of a square equal to $DF$.
Therefore $AC$ is irrational.

Such a straight line is called second bimedial.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The common logarithm of $2$:

$\log_{10} 2 \approx 0.30102 \, 99956 \, 63981 \, 19521 \, 37389 \ldots$
is irrational.


Proof
Because $5$ is a divisor of $10$ but not $2$, it cannot be the case that $2^a = 10^b$ for $a, b \in \Z_{>0}$.
Hence this is a special case of Irrationality of Logarithm.

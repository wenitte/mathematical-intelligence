Theorem
Let $\N_{> 0}$ be the $1$-based natural numbers.
Let $<$ be the strict ordering on $\N_{>0}$.

Then $<$ is a (strict) total ordering.


Proof
From Ordering on $1$-Based Natural Numbers is Trichotomy we have that $<$ is trichotomy.
From Ordering on $1$-Based Natural Numbers is Transitive we have that $<$ is transitive.
From Trichotomy is Antireflexive it follows that $<$ is antireflexive.
It follows by definition that $<$ is a strict ordering.
By the trichotomy law it follows that $<$ is a strict total ordering.
$\blacksquare$

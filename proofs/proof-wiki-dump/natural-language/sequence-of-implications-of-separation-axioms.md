Theorem
Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be separation axioms and let:

$P_1 \implies P_2$
mean:

If a topological space $T$ satsifies separation axiom $P_1$, then $T$ also satisfies separation axiom $P_2$.

Then the following sequence of separation axioms holds:











Perfectly Normal


$\implies$


Perfectly $T_4$


$\implies$


$T_4$









$\Big\Downarrow$















Completely Normal


$\implies$


$T_5$









$\Big\Downarrow$





$\Big\Downarrow$









Normal


$\implies$


$T_4$









$\Big\Downarrow$









$T_{3 \frac 1 2}$


$\impliedby$


Completely Regular (Tychonoff)


$\implies$


Urysohn



$\Big\Downarrow$





$\Big\Downarrow$





$\Big\Downarrow$



$T_3$


$\impliedby$


Regular


$\implies$


$T_{2 \frac 1 2}$ (Completely Hausdorff)









$\Big\Downarrow$





$\Big\Downarrow$









Semiregular


$\implies$


$T_2$ (Hausdorff)















$\Big\Downarrow$















$T_1$ (Fréchet)















$\Big\Downarrow$















$T_0$ (Kolmogorov)




Proof
The relevant justifications are listed as follows:

Perfectly Normal implies Perfectly $T_4$ implies $T_4$ by definition.
Perfectly Normal Space is Completely Normal Space.
Completely Normal implies $T_5$ by definition.
Completely Normal Space is Normal Space.
$T_5$ space is $T_4$ space.
Normal implies $T_4$ by definition.
Normal Space is Tychonoff (Completely Regular) Space.
Completely Regular (Tychonoff) implies $T_{3 \frac 1 2}$ by definition.
Completely Regular (Tychonoff) Space is Regular Space.
$T_{3 \frac 1 2}$ Space is $T_3$ Space.
Regular implies $T_3$ by definition.
Completely Regular (Tychonoff) Space is Urysohn Space.
Urysohn Space is Completely Hausdorff Space.
Regular Space is Completely Hausdorff Space.
Regular Space is Semiregular Space.
Completely Hausdorff Space is $T_2$ (Hausdorff) Space.
Semiregular implies $T_2$ (Hausdorff) by definition.
$T_2$ (Hausdorff) Space is $T_1$ (Fréchet) Space.
$T_1$ (Fréchet) Space is $T_0$ (Kolmogorov) Space.

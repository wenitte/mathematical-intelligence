Theorem
The real exponential function is continuous.
That is:

$\forall x_0 \in \R: \ds \lim_{x \mathop \to x_0} \exp x = \exp x_0$


Proof
This proof depends on the continuous extension definition of the exponential function.
Let $\exp$ be the unique continuous extension of $e^x$ from $\Q$ to $\R$.
By definition, $\exp$ is continuous.
Hence the result.

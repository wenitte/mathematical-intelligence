Theorem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $M$ be a free $R$-module.
Let $B$ and $C$ be bases of $M$.

Then $B$ and $C$ are equivalent.
That is, they have the same cardinality.


Proof
By definition, a basis is a generator.
By Basis of Free Module is No Greater than Generator, there exist:

an injection $f : B \to C$
an injection $g : C \to B$
By the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder Theorem, $B$ and $C$ are equivalent.
$\blacksquare$

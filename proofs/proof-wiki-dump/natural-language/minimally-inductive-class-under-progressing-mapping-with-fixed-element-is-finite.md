Theorem
Let $M$ be a class which is minimally inductive under a progressing mapping $g$.
Let there exist an element $x \in M$ such that $x = \map g x$.

Then $M$ is a finite class.


Proof
By Set of Subsets of Element of Minimally Inductive Class under Progressing Mapping is Finite, the set:

$\set {y \in M: y \subseteq x}$
is finite.
From Fixed Point of Progressing Mapping on Minimally Inductive Class is Greatest Element, $x$ is the greatest element of $M$.
Thus:

$M = \set {y \in M: y \subseteq x}$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

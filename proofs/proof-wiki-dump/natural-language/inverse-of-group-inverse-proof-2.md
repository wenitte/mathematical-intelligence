Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group.
Let $g \in G$, with inverse $g^{-1}$.

Then:

$\paren {g^{-1} }^{-1} = g$


Proof
Let $g \in G$.
Then:














\(\ds g g^{-1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e\)





Definition of Inverse Element








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds g\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {g^{-1} }^{-1}\)





Group Product Identity therefore Inverses

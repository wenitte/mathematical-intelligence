Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a particular point space.
Let $\sequence {a_i}$ be a convergent sequence in $T$.

Except for a finite number of indices, the terms of $\sequence {a_i}$ for which $a_i \ne p$ are all equal.


Proof
Let $\sequence {a_i}$ be a convergent sequence in $T$ whose limit is $\alpha$.
Then by definition every open set in $T$ containing $\alpha$ contains all but a finite number of terms of $\sequence {a_i}$.
This includes the open set $\set {\alpha, p}$.
Thus $\sequence {a_i}$ is such that, except for a finite number of terms, all are equal either to $\alpha$ or $p$.
Thus $\sequence {a_i}$ is such that, except for a finite number of terms, all such that $a_i \ne p$, are equal to $\alpha$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Empirical Odds Ratio
Let $P$ be a population of $250$ people.
Let $P_1$ be the set consisting of the $150$ members of $P$ who are smokers.
Let $P_2$ be the set consisting of the $100$ members of $P$ who do not smoke.

Let $Q$ be the property of the members of $P$ defined as:

$\forall x \in P: \map Q x$ means that $x$ has a certain disease supposed to be caused by smoking.
Let:

the number of members of $P_1$ with $Q$ be $12$
the number of members of $P_2$ with $Q$ be $2$.
The empirical odds ratio of having $Q$ relative to smoking or non-smoking is then:

$\theta^* = 4 \cdotp 26$


Proof
By definition of empirical odds ratio:














\(\ds \theta^*\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12 / \paren {150 - 12} } {2 / \paren {100 - 2} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12 / 138} {2 / 98}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \cdotp 26\)









$\blacksquare$

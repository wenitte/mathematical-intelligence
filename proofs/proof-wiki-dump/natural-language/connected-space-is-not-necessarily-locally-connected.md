Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is connected.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $T$ is also a locally connected space.


Proof
Let $C$ be the closed topologist's sine curve embedded in the real Euclidean plane.
From Closed Topologist's Sine Curve is Connected, $C$ is connected in $T$
From Closed Topologist's Sine Curve is not Locally Connected, $C$ is not locally connected.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

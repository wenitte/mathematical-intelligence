Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space where $S$ is a finite set.
Then $T$ is sequentially compact.


Proof
We have:

Finite Topological Space is Compact
Compact Space is Countably Compact
Finite Space is Second-Countable
Second-Countable Space is First-Countable
First-Countable Space is Sequentially Compact iff Countably Compact.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

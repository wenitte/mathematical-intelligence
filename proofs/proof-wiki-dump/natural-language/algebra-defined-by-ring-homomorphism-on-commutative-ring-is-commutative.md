Theorem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
Let $\struct {S, +, *}$ be a commutative ring.
Let $f: R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism.
Let $\struct {S_R, *}$ be the algebra defined by the ring homomorphism $f$.

Then $\struct {S_R, *}$ is a commutative algebra.


Proof
Note that by Center of Commutative Ring, the image of $f$ is indeed a subset of the center of $S$.
By definition, the multiplication of $\struct {S_R, *}$ is the ring product of $S$.
Thus it follows immediately from the fact that $S$ is a ring, that $\struct {S_R, *}$ is a commutative algebra.
$\blacksquare$

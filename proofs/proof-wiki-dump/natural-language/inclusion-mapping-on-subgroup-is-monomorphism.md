Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group.
Let $\struct {H, \circ {\restriction_H} }$ be a subgroup of $G$.
Let $i: H \to G$ be the inclusion mapping from $H$ to $G$.

Then $i$ is a group monomorphism.


Proof
We have:

Inclusion Mapping on Subgroup is Homomorphism
Inclusion Mapping is Injection
The result follows by definition of (group) monomorphism.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$ represent $2$ straight lines in the Cartesian plane which are represented by a quadratic equation $E$ in two variables:

$a x^2 + b y^2 + 2 h x y + 2 g x + 2 f y + c = 0$

Then $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$ are parallel respectively to the $2$ straight lines through the origin represented by the homogeneous quadratic equation:

$a x^2 + 2 h x y + b y^2$


Proof
From Characteristic of Quadratic Equation that Represents Two Straight Lines we have the conditions in which $E$ does indeed represent $2$ straight lines.
Let $E$ be written as:














\(\ds b \paren {y - \mu_1 x - b_1} \paren {y - \mu_2 x - b_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b y^2 - b \paren {\mu_1 + \mu_2} x y - b \paren {b_1 + b_2} y + b \mu_1 \mu_2 x^2 + b \paren {b_1 \mu_2 + b_2 \mu_2} + b b_1 b_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)

Comparing coefficients of equivalent terms:














\(\ds b \mu_1 \mu_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \mu_1 \mu_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac a b\)






















\(\ds -b \paren {\mu_1 + \mu_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 h\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \mu_1 + \mu_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {-2 h} b\)









Hence:

$a x^2 + 2 h x y + b y^2 = b \paren {y - \mu_1 x} \paren {y - \mu_2 x}$
From Homogeneous Quadratic Equation represents Two Straight Lines through Origin, it follows that:

$y = \mu_1 x$
$y = \mu_2 x$
are two straight lines through the origin represented by the homogeneous quadratic equation:

$a x^2 + 2 h x y + b y^2$
By definition of slope of a straight line, these have the same slope as the straight lines $\LL_1$ and $\LL_2$:

$y = \mu_1 x + b_1$
$y = \mu_2 x + b_2$
which are described by $E$.

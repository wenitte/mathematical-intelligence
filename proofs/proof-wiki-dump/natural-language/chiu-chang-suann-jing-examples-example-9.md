Example of Problem from Chiu Chang Suann Jing
What is the largest circle that can be inscribed within a right-angled triangle,
the two short sides of which are respectively $8$ and $15$?


Solution
The diameter of the circle is $6$.


Proof
Let the lengths of the short sides be denoted $a$ and $b$.
Let the length of the hypotenuse be denoted $c$.
Without loss of generality let $a \le b$.
Let the right-angled triangle be half of a rectangle whose sides are of length $a$ and $b$.
Let the rectangle be dissected along the straight lines shown.
Let $2$ copies of this rectangle be assembled into one long rectangle whose length is $a + b + c$ and whose width is $D$.
Note that $D$ is the diameter of the circle that we are required to find.


Thus we have that:

$D \paren {a + b + c} = 2 a b$
Setting $a = 8$, $b = 15$, from Pythagoras's Theorem we have that $c = 17$.
Thus we have that:














\(\ds D\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 a b} {a + b + c}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 \times 8 \times 15} {8 + 15 + 17}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {240} {40}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)

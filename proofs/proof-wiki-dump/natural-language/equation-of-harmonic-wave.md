Theorem
Let $\phi$ be a harmonic wave which is propagated along the $x$-axis in the positive direction with constant velocity $c$.
Then the disturbance of $\phi$ at point $x$ and time $t$ can be expressed using the equation:

$\map \phi {x, t} = a \map \cos {\omega \paren {x - c t} }$

$\phi$ can also be expressed in the following forms:


In Terms of Wavelength and Velocity
$\map \phi {x, t} = a \map \cos {\dfrac {2 \pi} \lambda \paren {x - c t} }$
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of $\phi$


In Terms of Wavelength and Period
$\map \phi {x, t} = a \map \cos {2 \pi \paren {\dfrac x \lambda - \dfrac t \tau} }$
where:

$\lambda$ is the wavelength of $\phi$
$\tau$ is the period of $\phi$.


In Terms of Wavelength and Frequency
$\map \phi {x, t} = a \map \cos {2 \pi \paren {\dfrac x \lambda - \nu t} }$
where:

$\lambda$ is the wavelength of $\phi$
$\nu$ is the frequency of $\phi$.


In Terms of Wave Number and Frequency
$\map \phi {x, t} = a \map \cos {2 \pi \paren {k x - \nu t} }$
where:

$k$ is the wave number of $\phi$
$\nu$ is the frequency of $\phi$.


Proof
From Wave Profile of Harmonic Wave:

$\forall x \in \R: \paren {\map \phi x}_{t \mathop = 0} = a \cos \omega x$

From Equation of Wave with Constant Velocity:

$\forall x, t \in \R: \map \phi {x, t} = a \map \cos {\omega \paren {x - c t} }$

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

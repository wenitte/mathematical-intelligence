Examples of Reduced Residue Systems
The set of integers:

$\set {1, 25, 49, 121, 169, 289}$
does not form a reduced residue system modulo $18$.


Proof
We have:














\(\ds 25\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 \times 18 + 7\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 7\)

\(\ds \pmod {18}\)


















\(\ds 49\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times 18 + 13\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 13\)

\(\ds \pmod {18}\)


















\(\ds 121\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \times 18 + 13\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 13\)

\(\ds \pmod {18}\)


















\(\ds 169\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 \times 18 + 7\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 7\)

\(\ds \pmod {18}\)


















\(\ds 289\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16 \times 18 + 1\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 1\)

\(\ds \pmod {18}\)







Thus we see that:

$\set {1, 25, 49, 121, 169, 289}$
is equivalent to:

$\set {1, 7, 13}$

While $\set {1, 7, 13}$ are all coprime to $18$, they do not form a least positive reduced residue system modulo $18$, which is:

$\set {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}$
from Least Positive Reduced Residue System Modulo 18.

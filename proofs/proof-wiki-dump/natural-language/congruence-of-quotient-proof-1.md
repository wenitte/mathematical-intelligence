Theorem
Let $a, b \in \Z$ and $n \in \N$.
Let $a$ be congruent to $b$ modulo $n$, that is $a \equiv b \pmod n$.
Let $d \in \Z: d > 0$ such that $d$ is a common divisor of $a, b$ and $n$.

Then:

$\dfrac a d \equiv \dfrac b d \pmod {n / d}$


Proof
By definition of congruence modulo $n$:

$a = b + k n$
Dividing through by $d$ (which you can do because $d$ divides all three terms), we get:

$\dfrac a d = \dfrac b d + k \dfrac n d$
from which the result follows directly.

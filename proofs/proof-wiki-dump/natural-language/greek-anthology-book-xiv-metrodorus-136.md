Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
Brick-makers, I am in a great hurry to erect this house.
To-day is cloudless, and I do not require many more bricks, but I have all I want but three hundred.
Thou alone in one day couldst make as many,
but thy son left off working when he had finished two hundred,
and thy son-in-law when he had made two hundred and fifty.
Working all together, in how many hours can you make these?


Solution
Let $b$ be the number of bricks they can produce together in one day.
Then:














\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 300 + 200 + 250\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 750\)










Thus it takes $\dfrac {300} {750} = \dfrac 2 5$ of a day to produce $300$ bricks when all working together.
$\blacksquare$

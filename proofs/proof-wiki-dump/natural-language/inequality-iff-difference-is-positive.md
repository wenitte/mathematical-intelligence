This definition needs to be completed.In particular: Turn this into a definition page -- this is how e.g. Smith defines the inequality relation.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by adding or completing the definition.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{DefinitionWanted}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.


Theorem
Let $x, y \in \R$.

Then the following are equivalent:

$(1): \quad x < y$
$(2): \quad y - x > 0$


Proof













\(\ds x < y\)

\(\leadstoandfrom\)







\(\ds y > x\)





Definition of Dual Ordering














\(\ds \)

\(\leadstoandfrom\)







\(\ds y + \paren {-x} > x + \paren {-x}\)





Real Number Ordering is Compatible with Addition














\(\ds \)

\(\leadstoandfrom\)







\(\ds y + \paren {-x} > 0\)





Real Number Axiom $\R \text A4$: Inverses for Addition














\(\ds \)

\(\leadstoandfrom\)







\(\ds y - x > 0\)





Definition of Field Subtraction



Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Note

This page or section has statements made on it that ought to be extracted and proved in a Theorem page.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by creating any appropriate Theorem pages that may be needed.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.
If the notion of an ordering on $\R$ has not already been defined rigorously, this is often taken to be the definition of $x < y$.

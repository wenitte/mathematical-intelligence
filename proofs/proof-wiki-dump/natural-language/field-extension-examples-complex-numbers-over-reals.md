Examples of Field Extensions
The complex numbers $\C$ forms a finite field extension over the real numbers $\R$ of degree $2$.


Proof
It follows from Real Numbers form Subfield of Complex Numbers that $\C$ is an extension of $\R$.
From Vector Space over Division Subring: Real Numbers in Complex Numbers we have that the dimension of the vector space on $\C$ over $\R$ is $2$.
$\blacksquare$

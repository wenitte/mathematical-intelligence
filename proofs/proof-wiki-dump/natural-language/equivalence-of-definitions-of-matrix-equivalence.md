Theorem
Let $R$ be a ring with unity.
Let $\mathbf A, \mathbf B$ be $m \times n$ matrices over $R$.

The following definitions of the concept of Matrix Equivalence are equivalent:

Definition 1
Let there exist:

a nonsingular square matrix $\mathbf P$ of order $n$ over $R$
a nonsingular square matrix $\mathbf Q$ of order $m$ over $R$
such that:

$\mathbf B = \mathbf Q^{-1} \mathbf A \mathbf P$

Then $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ are equivalent.

Definition 2
$\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ are equivalent if and only if they are the relative matrices, to (possibly) different ordered bases, of the same linear transformation.


Proof
This is specifically demonstrated in Change of Basis Matrix under Linear Transformation.

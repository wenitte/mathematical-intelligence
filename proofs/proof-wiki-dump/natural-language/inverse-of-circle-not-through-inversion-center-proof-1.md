Theorem
Let $\CC$ be a circle in the plane on center $O$.
Let $T : X \to Y$ be an inversive transformation with $\CC$ as the inversion circle. 
Then $O$ is the inversion center.
Let $K$ be an arbitrary circle distinct from $\CC$ and not through $O$.

Then the image under $T$ of all the points on $K$ lie on the same circle, distinct from both $K$ and $\CC$.


Proof
Let $AB$ be the diameter of $K$, drawn so that $OAB$ are collinear points.
Let $A'$ and $B'$ be the image of $A$ and $B$ under $T$.
Let $K'$ be the circle with diameter $A'B'$
Let $C$ be an otherwise arbitrary point, lying on $K$.

By converse to Thales' Theorem:

$C'$ is on circle with diameter $A'B'$
We note two other arrangements both covered by this proof.

$K$ outside and tangent to $\CC$
$K$ cuts $\CC$ but not through $O$
The third possibility is simply the inverse of an inversive transformation.

$K$ inside $\CC$ and not through $O$

But this follows, since $T$ is an involution

Problem
Consider a frame consisting of $4$ rods freely hinged at their ends:




When will the area enclosed by the frame be a maximum?


Solution
When the quadrilateral formed by the frame is cyclic.


Proof
This problem is a direct application of the result:

Area of Quadrilateral with Given Sides is Greatest when Quadrilateral is Cyclic
$\blacksquare$

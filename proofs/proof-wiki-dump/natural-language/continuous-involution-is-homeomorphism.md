Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $f: S \to S$ be a continuous involution.

Then $f$ is a homeomorphism.


Proof
From Involution is Permutation, $f$ is a permutation and so a bijection.
Since $f$ is continuous, it suffices to verify that its inverse is also continuous.
Now recall $f$ is an involution, that is, $f^{-1} = f$.

Thus $f^{-1}$ is also continuous.
Hence $f$ is a homeomorphism.

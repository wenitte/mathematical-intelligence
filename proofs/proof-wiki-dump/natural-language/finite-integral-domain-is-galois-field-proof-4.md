Theorem
A finite integral domain is a Galois field.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ is a finite integral domain which is not a field.
From Non-Field Integral Domain has Infinite Number of Ideals, $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ has an infinite number of distinct ideals.
But this contradicts the assertion that $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ is finite.
Hence the result by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

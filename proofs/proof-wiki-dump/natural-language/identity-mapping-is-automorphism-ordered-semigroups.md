Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ, \preccurlyeq}$ be an ordered semigroup.
Then $I_S: \struct {S, \circ, \preccurlyeq} \to \struct {S, \circ, \preccurlyeq}$ is a ordered semigroup automorphism.


Proof
From Identity Mapping is Semigroup Automorphism:

$I_S: \struct {S, \circ} \to \struct {S, \circ}$ is a semigroup automorphism.
From Identity Mapping is Order Isomorphism:

$I_S: \struct {S, \preccurlyeq} \to \struct {S, \preccurlyeq}$ is an order isomorphism.
$\blacksquare$

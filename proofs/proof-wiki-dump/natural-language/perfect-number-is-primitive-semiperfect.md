Theorem
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$ be a perfect number.

Then $n$ is also a primitive semiperfect number.


Proof
Let $n$ be perfect.
From Divisor of Perfect Number is Deficient, all divisors of $n$ are deficient.
But from Semiperfect Number is not Deficient, it follows that the divisors of $n$ cannot be semiperfect.
Hence the result, by definition of primitive semiperfect number.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Order of Finite Abelian Group with $p+$ Order $p$ Elements is Divisible by $p^2$
Let $G$ be a finite abelian group whose identity is $e$.
Let $G$ have more than $2$ elements of order $3$.
Then:

$9 \divides \order G$
where:

$\divides$ denotes divisibility
$\order G$ denotes the order of $G$.


Proof 1
By hypothesis there are elements $x, y$ of order $3$ in $G$ such that $x, y, x^2$ are all different.
Consider the subset of $G$:

$SÂ := \set {x^i y^j: 0 \le i, j \le 2}$
By the Finite Subgroup Test, $S$ is a subgroup of $G$ which has $9$ elements.
By Lagrange's theorem:

$\order S \divides \order G$
But $\order S = 9$ and so $9 \divides \order G$.

Proof 2
An example of Order of Finite Abelian Group with $p+$ Order $p$ Elements is Divisible by $p^2$, setting $p = 3$.

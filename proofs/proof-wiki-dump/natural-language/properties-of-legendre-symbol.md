Theorem
Let $p$ be an odd prime.
Let $a \in \Z$.
Let $\paren {\dfrac a p}$ be the Legendre symbol::

$\paren {\dfrac a p}Â := a^{\paren {\frac {p - 1} 2} } \pmod p$


Quadratic Character
$\paren {\dfrac a p} = 0$ if and only if $a \equiv 0 \pmod p$
$\paren {\dfrac a p} = 1$ if and only if $a$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$
$\paren {\dfrac a p} = -1$ if and only if $a$ is a quadratic non-residue mod $p$.


Congruent Integers
If $a \equiv b \pmod p$, then:

$\paren {\dfrac a p} = \paren {\dfrac b p}$


Multiplicative Nature
$\paren {\dfrac {a b} p} = \paren {\dfrac a p} \paren {\dfrac b p}$


Square is Quadratic Residue
$\paren {\dfrac {a^2} p} = 1$


Proofs
Proof of Quadratic Character
$\paren {\dfrac a p} = 0$ if and only if $a \equiv 0 \pmod p$:
Follows from Euler's Criterion for Quadratic Residue.


$\paren {\dfrac a p} = 1$ if and only if $a$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$:
This follows directly from the definition of quadratic residue and Euler's Criterion for Quadratic Residue.


$\paren {\dfrac a p} = -1$ if and only if $a$ is a quadratic non-residue mod $p$:
This follows directly from the definition of quadratic non-residue and Euler's Criterion for Quadratic Residue.
$\blacksquare$


Proof of Congruent Integers
If $a \equiv b \pmod p$, then $\paren {\dfrac a p} = \paren {\dfrac b p}$:
This is just a statement of the quadratic character of congruent integers.
$\blacksquare$


Proof of Multiplicative Nature
$\paren {\dfrac {a b} p} = \paren {\dfrac a p} \paren {\dfrac b p}$:
Follows directly from the identity:

$\paren {a b}^{\paren {\frac {p - 1} 2} } = a^{\paren {\frac {p - 1} 2} } b^{\paren {\frac {p - 1} 2} }$
$\blacksquare$

$\paren {\dfrac {a^2} p} = 1$:
Follows directly from the definition.
Alternatively, it also follows from the fact that the Legendre symbol is multiplicative.

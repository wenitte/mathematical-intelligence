Theorem
Let $\mathbf P$ be a preorder category.
Let $f \in \mathbf P_1$ be a morphism.

Then $f$ is epic.


Proof
Suppose that $g, h \in \mathbf P_1$ are morphisms such that:

$g \circ f = h \circ f$
In particular then, $g$ and $h$ have equal domain and codomain.

Since $\mathbf P$ is a preorder category, there is at most one morphism between any two objects.
Thus necessarily $g = h$, and hence $f$ is epic.
$\blacksquare$

Problem
On a Statue of Pallas
I, Pallas, am of beaten gold, but the gold is the gift of lusty poets.
Charisius gave half the gold,
Thespis one-eighth,
Solon one-tenth,
and Themison one-twentieth,
but the remaining nine talents and the workmanship are the gift of Aristodicius.


Solution
Let $n$ talents be the weight or worth of the statue of Pallas (it is not clear which is meant, but this detail is immaterial).
Then:

$\dfrac n 2$ was given by Charisius
$\dfrac n 8$ was given by Thespis
$\dfrac n {10}$ was given by Solon
$\dfrac n {20}$ was given by Themison
$9$ talents were given by Aristodicius.

Thus:














\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac n 2 + \dfrac n 8 + \dfrac n {10} + \dfrac n {20} + 9\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 40 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20 n + 5 n + 4 n + 2 n + 360\)





multiplying through by $40$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 9 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 360\)





gathering terms








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40\)





dividing both sides by $9$




Thus

$20$ talents were provided by Charisius
$5$ talents were provided by Thespis
$4$ talents were provided by Solon
$2$ talents were provided by Themison
and the remaining $9$ talents were provided by Aristodicius.

and it is seen that:

$20 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 9 = 40$
$\blacksquare$

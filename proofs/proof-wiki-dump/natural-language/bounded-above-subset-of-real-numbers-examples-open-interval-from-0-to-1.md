Example of Bounded Above Subset of Real Numbers
Let $I$ be the open real interval defined as:

$I := \openint 0 1$
Then $I$ is bounded above by, for example, $1$, $2$ and $3$, of which $1$ is the supremum.
However, $I$ does not have a greatest element.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $x \in I$ is the greatest element of $I$.
Then $x < \dfrac {x + 1} 2 < 1$ by Mediant is Between.
Thus $\dfrac {x + 1} 2 \in I$ but $x < \dfrac {x + 1} 2$.
So $x$ is not the greatest element of $I$ after all.
So by Proof by Contradiction it follows that $I$ has no greatest element.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Pythagorean Triangle
The triangle whose sides are of length $6$, $8$ and $10$ is a Pythagorean triangle.
This is not a primitive Pythagorean triangle.





Proof













\(\ds 6^2 + 8^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2^2 \times 3^2 + 2^2 \times 4^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times \paren {9 + 16}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 25\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2^2 \times 5^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10^2\)









It follows by Pythagoras's Theorem that $6$, $8$ and $10$ form a Pythagorean triple.

Note that $6$ and $8$ are not coprime as $\gcd \set {6, 8} = 2$.
Hence, by definition, $6$, $8$ and $10$ do not form a primitive Pythagorean triple.
The result follows by definition of a primitive Pythagorean triangle.
$\blacksquare$

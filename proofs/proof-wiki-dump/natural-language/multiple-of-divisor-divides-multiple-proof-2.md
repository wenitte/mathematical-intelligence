Theorem
Let $a, b, c \in \Z$.
Let:

$a \divides b$
where $\divides$ denotes divisibility.

Then:

$a c \divides b c$


Proof
By definition, if $a \divides b$ then $\exists d \in \Z: a d = b$.
Then:

$\paren {a d} c = b c$
that is:

$\paren {a c} d = b c$
which follows because Integer Multiplication is Commutative and Integer Multiplication is Associative.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T_A = \struct {A, \tau_A}$ and $T_B = \struct {B, \tau_B}$ be topological spaces.
Let $\phi: T_A \to T_B$ be a continuous mapping.

If $T_A$ is a first-countable space, then it does not necessarily follow that $T_B$ is also first-countable.


Proof
Let $T_S = \struct {S, \tau_S}$ be the Arens-Fort space.
Let $T_D = \struct {S, \tau_D}$ be the discrete space, also on $S$.
Let $I_S: S \to S$ be the identity mapping on $S$.

From Mapping from Discrete Space is Continuous, we have that $I_S$ is a continuous mapping.
Then we have:

Discrete Space is First-Countable
Arens-Fort Space is not First-Countable
Thus we have demonstrated a continuous mapping from a first-countable space to a space which is not first-countable space.
$\blacksquare$

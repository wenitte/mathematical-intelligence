Theorem
Let $\struct {F, +, \circ}$ be a field whose zero is $0_F$ and whose unity is $1_F$.
Let $X$ be transcendental over $F$.
Let $F \sqbrk X$ be the ring of polynomials in $X$ over $F$.

Then $F \sqbrk X$ is a principal ideal domain.


Proof
We have that Polynomial Forms over Field is Euclidean Domain.
We also have that Euclidean Domain is Principal Ideal Domain.
Hence the result.

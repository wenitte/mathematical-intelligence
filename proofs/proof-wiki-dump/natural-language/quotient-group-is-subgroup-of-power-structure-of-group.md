Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group.
Let $\struct {N, \circ}$ be a normal subgroup of $\struct {G, \circ}$.

Then $\struct {G / N, \circ_N}$ is a subgroup of $\struct {\powerset G, \circ_\PP}$, where:

$\struct {G / N, \circ_N}$ is the quotient group of $G$ by $N$
$\struct {\powerset G, \circ_\PP}$ is the power structure of $\struct {G, \circ}$.


Proof
Follows directly from:

Quotient Group is Group
Cosets of $G$ by $N$ are subsets of $G$ and therefore elements of $\powerset G$
The operation $\circ_N$ is defined as the subset product of cosets.
$\blacksquare$

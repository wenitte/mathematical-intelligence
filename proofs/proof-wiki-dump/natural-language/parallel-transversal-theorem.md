Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If a straight line be drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle, it will cut the sides of the triangle proportionally; and, if the sides of the triangle be cut proportionally [so that the segments adjacent to the third side are corresponding terms in the proportion], the line joining the points of section will be parallel to the remaining side of the triangle.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VI}$: Proposition $2$)


Proof
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
Let $DE$ be drawn parallel to the side $BC$.
We need to show that $BD : DA = CE : EA$.


Let $BE$ and $CD$ be joined.
From Triangles with Equal Base and Same Height have Equal Area the area of $\triangle BDE$ is the same as the area of $\triangle CDE$.
From Ratios of Equal Magnitudes:

$\triangle BDE : \triangle ADE = \triangle CDE : \triangle ADE$
From Areas of Triangles and Parallelograms Proportional to Base:

$\triangle BDE : \triangle ADE = BD : DA$
By the same reasoning:

$\triangle CDE : \triangle ADE = CE : EA$
From Equality of Ratios is Transitive:

$BD : DA = CE : EA$
$\Box$

Now let the sides $AB, AC$ of $\triangle ABC$ be cut proportionally, so that $BD : DA = CE : EA$.
Join $DE$. 
We need to show that $DE \parallel BC$.

We use the same construction as above.
From Areas of Triangles and Parallelograms Proportional to Base we have that:

$BD : DA = \triangle BDE : \triangle ADE$
$CE : EA = \triangle CDE : \triangle ADE$
From Equality of Ratios is Transitive:

$\triangle BDE : \triangle ADE = \triangle CDE : \triangle ADE$
So from Magnitudes with Same Ratios are Equal, the area of $\triangle BDE$ is the same as the area of $\triangle CDE$.
But these triangles are on the same base $DE$.
So from Equal Sized Triangles on Same Base have Same Height, it follows that $DE$ and $BC$ are parallel.

The Parallel Transversal Theorem is also known as the Intercept Theorem.


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $2$ of Book $\text{VI}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

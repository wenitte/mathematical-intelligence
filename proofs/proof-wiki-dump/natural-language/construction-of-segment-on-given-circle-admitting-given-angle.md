Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

From a given circle to cut off a segment admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.
(The Elements: Book $\text{III}$: Proposition $34$)


Construction

Let $ABC$ be the given circle, and let $D$ be the given rectilineal angle.
Let $EF$ be drawn tangent to $ABC$ at $B$.
Let $\angle FBC$ be constructed equal to $\angle D$.
Then $BC$ is a straight line which forms the base of a segment which admits an angle equal to $D$.


Proof
Let $A$ be selected anywhere on the circle opposite the segment in question.
From the Tangent-Chord Theorem, $\angle BAC = \angle FBC$.
But $\angle FBC = \angle D$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $34$ of Book $\text{III}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Theorem
Let $\On$ be the class of all ordinals.
Then the restriction of the subset relation, $\subseteq$, to $\On$ is a well-ordering.
That is:

$\subseteq$ is an ordering on $\On$.
If $A$ is a non-empty subclass of $\On$, then $A$ has a smallest element under the subset relation.


Proof
From Class of All Ordinals is $g$-Tower, $\On$ is a $g$-tower.
The result follows from $g$-Tower is Well-Ordered under Subset Relation.
$\blacksquare$

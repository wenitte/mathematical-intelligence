Theorem
Let $\R$ be the real number line considered as a Euclidean space.
Let $S \subseteq \R$ be compact subspace of $\R$.

Then $S$ is closed and bounded in $\R$.


Proof 1
From:

Non-Closed Set of Real Numbers is not Compact
Unbounded Set of Real Numbers is not Compact
the result follows by the Rule of Transposition.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
From Real Number Line is Metric Space, $\left({\R, d}\right)$ is a metric space, where $d$ denotes the Euclidean metric on $\R$.
Therefore, the result follows from:

Metric Space is Hausdorff
Compact Subspace of Hausdorff Space is Closed
and:

Compact Metric Space is Totally Bounded
Totally Bounded Metric Space is Bounded
$\blacksquare$

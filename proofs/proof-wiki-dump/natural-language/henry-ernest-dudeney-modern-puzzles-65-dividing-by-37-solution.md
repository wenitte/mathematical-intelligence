Dividing by $37$
I want to know whether the number $49,129,308,213$ is exactly divisible by $37$,
or if not, what is the remainder when so divided.
How may I do this quite easily without any process of actual division whatever?


Solution
$49,129,308,213 = 37 \times 1,327,819,140 + 33$
Hence the remainder is $33$.


Proof
We proceed by Divisibility by 37.
In each group of $3$ digits of $49,129,308,213$, counting from the least significant digit:

$\color {blue} {49}, \color {red} 1 \color {blue} {29}, \color {red} 3 \color {blue} {08}, \color {red} 2 \color {blue} {13}$
Then we add up the $\color { blue } {\text {blue} }$ numbers:

 49
 29
 08
+13
---
 99

and subtract $11$ times the sum of the $\color { red } {\text {red} }$ numbers:

11 x (1 + 3 + 2) = 66
99 - 66 = 33
Hence the remainder is $33$.
To check, we perform the calculation using an online calculator or otherwise:

$49,129,308,213 = 37 \times 1,327,819,140 + 33$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
${}^{n - 1} P_n = {}^n P_n$
where ${}^k P_n$ denotes the number of ordered selections of $k$ objects from $n$.


Proof













\(\ds {}^{n - 1} P_n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n^{\underline {n - 1} }\)





Number of Permutations: $n^{\underline {n - 1} }$ denotes Falling Factorial














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds n!\)





Integer to Power of Itself Less One Falling is Factorial














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds {}^n P_n\)





Number of Permutations



$\blacksquare$

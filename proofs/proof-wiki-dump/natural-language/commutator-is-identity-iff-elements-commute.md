Theorem
Let $G$ be a group whose identity is $e$.
Let $x, y \in G$.
Let $\sqbrk {x, y}$ denote the commutator of $x$ and $y$.

Then $\sqbrk {x, y} = e$ if and only if $x$ and $y$ commute.


Proof
As $G$ is a group, it is a fortiori a monoid.

Hence Product of Commuting Elements with Inverses applies:

$x y x^{-1} y^{-1} = e = x^{-1} y^{-1} x y$
$\blacksquare$

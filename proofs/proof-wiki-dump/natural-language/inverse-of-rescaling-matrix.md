Theorem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $r \in R$ be a unit in $R$.
Let $r \, \mathbf I_n$ be the $n \times n$ rescaling matrix of $r$.

Then:

$\paren {r \, \mathbf I_n}^{-1} = r^{-1} \, \mathbf I_n$


Proof
By definition, a rescaling matrix is also a diagonal matrix.
Hence Inverse of Diagonal Matrix applies, and since $r$ is a unit, it gives the desired result.

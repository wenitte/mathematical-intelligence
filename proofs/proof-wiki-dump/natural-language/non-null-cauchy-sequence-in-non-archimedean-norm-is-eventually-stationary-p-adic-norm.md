Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a Cauchy sequence such that $\sequence {x_n}$ does not converge to $0$.
Then:

$\exists N \in \N: \forall n, m \ge N: \norm {x_n}_p = \norm {x_m}_p$


Proof
From:

P-adic Numbers form Non-Archimedean Valued Field
Non-Null Cauchy Sequence in Non-Archimedean Norm is Eventually Stationary
it follows that:

$\exists N \in \N: \forall n, m \ge N: \norm {x_n}_p = \norm {x_m}_p$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\Q$ be the set of rational numbers.
Let $S$ be the set of all simple finite continued fractions in $\Q$, whose last partial denominators is not $1$.

The mappings:

$\Q \to S$ that sends an rational number to its continued fraction expansion
$S \to \Q$ that sends a simple finite continued fractions to its value
are inverses of each other.


Even length
Let $S_0$ be the set of all simple finite continued fractions in $\Q$ of even length.

The mappings:

$\Q \to S$ that sends an rational number to:
its continued fraction expansion $\sqbrk {a_0, \ldots, a_n}$ if $n$ is even
$\sqbrk {a_0, \ldots, a_n - 1, 1}$ if $n$ is odd
$S \to \Q$ that sends a simple finite continued fractions to its value
are inverses of each other.


Odd length
Let $S_1$ be the set of all simple finite continued fractions in $\Q$ of odd length.

The mappings:

$\Q \to S$ that sends an rational number to:
its continued fraction expansion $\sqbrk {a_0, \ldots, a_n}$ if $n$ is odd
$\sqbrk {a_0, \ldots, a_n - 1, 1}$ if $n$ is even
$S \to \Q$ that sends a simple finite continued fractions to its value
are inverses of each other.


Proof
Note that indeed Simple Finite Continued Fraction has Rational Value.
The result follows from:

Value of Continued Fraction Expansion of Rational Number equals Number Itself
Continued Fraction Expansion of Value of Simple Finite Continued Fraction equals Expansion Itself
$\blacksquare$

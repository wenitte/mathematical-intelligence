Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Singular Matrix are equivalent:

Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a ring with unity.
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$ be a (strictly) positive integer.
Let $\mathbf A$ be an element of the ring of square matrices $\struct {\map {\MM_R} n, +, \times}$.


Definition 1
Let $\mathbf A$ have no inverse.
Then $\mathbf A$ is referred to as singular.

Definition 2
Let the determinant of $\mathbf A$ be equal to $0$.
Then $\mathbf A$ is referred to as singular.


Proof
Follows directly from Matrix is Nonsingular iff Determinant has Multiplicative Inverse.
$\blacksquare$

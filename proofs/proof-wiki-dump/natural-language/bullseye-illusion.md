Classic Problem


The circle of radius $3 a$ at the center has the same area as the outer annulus whose width is $1$.

However, it appears to be larger.


Proof
From the diagram, it is seen that the circles are evenly spaced.
Let $C$ denote the circle of radius $3 a$ at the center, colored orange.
Let $A$ denote the outer annulus of width $a$ and outer radius $5 a$, colored blue.

We have that:














\(\ds \map \Area C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \pi \paren {3 a}^2\)





Area of Circle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 \pi a^2\)
























\(\ds \map \Area A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \pi \paren {\paren {5 a}^2 - \paren {4 a}^2}\)





Area of Annulus














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \pi a^2 \paren {25 - 16}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 \pi a^2\)










Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

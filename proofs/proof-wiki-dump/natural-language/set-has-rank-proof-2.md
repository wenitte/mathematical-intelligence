Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.

Then $S$ has a rank.

Let $G$ be the smallest transitive set containing $S$ as a subset.
By Set Contained in Smallest Transitive Set, $G$ must exist.
By Transitive Set Contained in Von Neumann Hierarchy Level, $G \subseteq V_i$ for some ordinal $i$.
Therefore:

$G \in V_{i + 1}$

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Proper Well-Ordering determines Smallest Elements only applies once it's been shown that initial segments are setsYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
We have that Ordinals are Well-Ordered
From Proper Well-Ordering determines Smallest Elements, there exists a smallest ordinal $k$ such that $G \in V_{k + 1}$.
Hence, by definition, $G$ has rank $k$.
$\blacksquare$

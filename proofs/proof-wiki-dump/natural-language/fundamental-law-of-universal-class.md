Theorem
$\forall x: x \in \Bbb U$
where:

$\Bbb U$ denotes the universal class
$x$ denotes a set.


Proof
From the definition of the universal class:

$\Bbb U = \set {x: x = x}$
From this, it follows immediately that:

$\forall x: \paren {x \in \Bbb U \iff x = x}$
From Equality is Reflexive, $x = x$ is a tautology.
Thus the asserted statement is also tautologous.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The linear first order ODE:

$(1): \quad \dfrac {\d y} {\d x} - \dfrac y x = 3 x$
has the general solution:

$\dfrac y x = 3 x + C$
or:

$y = 3 x^2 + C x$


Proof
This is an instance of Linear First Order ODE: $y' - \dfrac y x = k x$.
Its solution is:

$\dfrac y x = k x + C$
or:

$y = k x^2 + C x$
from which the solution to $(1)$ is found by substituting $3$ for $k$.
$\blacksquare$

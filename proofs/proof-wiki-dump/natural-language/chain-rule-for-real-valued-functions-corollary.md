Theorem
Let $\Psi$ represent a differentiable function of $x$ and $y$.
Let $y$ represent a differentiable function of $x$.
Then:














\(\ds \frac {\d \Psi} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\partial \Psi} {\partial x} + \frac {\partial \Psi} {\partial y} \frac {\d y} {\d x}\)











Proof













\(\ds \frac {\d \Psi} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\partial \Psi} {\partial x} \frac {\d x} {\d x} + \frac {\partial \Psi} {\partial y} \frac {\d y} {\d x}\)

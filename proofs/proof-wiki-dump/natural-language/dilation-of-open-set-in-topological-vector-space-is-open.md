Theorem
Let $K$ be a topological field.
Let $X$ be a topological vector space over $K$. 
Let $\lambda \in K \setminus \set {0_K}$. 
Let $U$ be a open set in $X$.

Then $\lambda U$, the dilation of $U$ by $\lambda$ is open.


Proof
Let $c_\lambda$ be the dilation by $\lambda$ mapping.
From Dilation Mapping on Topological Vector Space is Homeomorphism, $c_\lambda$ is a homeomorphism.
Hence the image $c_\lambda \sqbrk U$ is open.
That is, $\lambda U$ is open.
$\blacksquare$

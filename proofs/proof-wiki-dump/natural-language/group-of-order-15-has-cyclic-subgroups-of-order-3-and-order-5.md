Theorem
Let $G$ be a group whose order is $15$.
Then $G$ has

a cyclic subgroup of order $3$
and:

a cyclic subgroup of order $5$.


Proof
Let $G$ be a group of order $15$.
We have that $15 = 3 \times 5$.
Thus from the First Sylow Theorem:

$G$ has at least one subgroup $H_3$ of order $3$
and:

$G$ has at least one subgroup $H_5$ of order $5$.
From Prime Group is Cyclic, all such subgroups of order $3$ and order $5$ are cyclic.

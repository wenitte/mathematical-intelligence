Theorem
This general pattern can be used to find a factorial which is the product of three factorials:

$\paren {\paren {n!}!}! = n! \paren {n! - 1}! \paren {\paren {n!}! - 1}!$
while there are instances of factorials which do not fit that pattern.


Proof













\(\ds \paren {\paren {n!}!}!\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {n!}! \times \paren {\paren {n!}! - 1}!\)





Factorial as Product of Two Factorials














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds n! \times \paren {n! - 1}! \times \paren {\paren {n!}! - 1}!\)





Factorial as Product of Two Factorials



$\blacksquare$


Examples
$10!$ as Product of $3$ Factorials
$10! = 7! \times 5! \times 3!$


$16!$ as Product of $3$ Factorials
$16! = 14! \times 5! \times 2!$

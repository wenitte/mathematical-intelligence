Example of Relation which is not Equivalence
Let $\Z$ denote the set of integers.
Let $\RR$ denote the relation on $\Z$ defined as:

$\forall x, y \in \Z: x \mathrel \RR y \iff x + y \text { is divisible by } 3$
Then $\RR$ is not an equivalence relation.


Proof
Let $x = 1$.
Then:

$x + x = 2$
and so $x + x$ is not divisible by $3$.
Thus $\RR$ is seen to be non-reflexive.

Hence by definition $\RR$ is not an equivalence relation.
$\blacksquare$

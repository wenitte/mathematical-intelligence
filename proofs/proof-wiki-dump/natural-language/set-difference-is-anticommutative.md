Theorem
Set difference is an anticommutative operation:

$S = T \iff S \setminus T = T \setminus S = \O$


Proof
From Set Difference with Superset is Empty Set‎ we have:

$S \subseteq T \iff S \setminus T = \O$
$T \subseteq S \iff T \setminus S = \O$
The result follows from definition of set equality:

$S = T \iff \paren {S \subseteq T} \land \paren {T \subseteq S}$
$\blacksquare$

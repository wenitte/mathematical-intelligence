Theorem
The intersection of two equivalence relations is itself an equivalence relation.


Proof
Let $\RR_1$ and $\RR_2$ be equivalence relations on $S$.
Let $\RR_3 = \RR_1 \cap \RR_2$.
Checking in turn each of the criteria for equivalence:


Reflexive
Equivalence relations are by definition reflexive.
So, by Intersection of Reflexive Relations is Reflexive, so is $\RR_3$.


Symmetric
Equivalence relations are by definition symmetric.
So, by Intersection of Symmetric Relations is Symmetric, so is $\RR_3$.


Transitive
Equivalence relations are by definition transitive.
So, by Intersection of Transitive Relations is Transitive, so is $\RR_3$.

Thus $\RR_3$ is an equivalence.
$\blacksquare$

Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $32$
De Quodam Patrefamilias Distribuente Annonam
A Lord of the Manor Distributing Grain
A gentleman has a household of $20$ persons and orders that they be given $20$ measures of grain.
He directs that:
each man should receive $3$ measures,
each woman $2$ measures,
and each child $\frac 1 2$ a measure.
How many men, women and children must there be?


Solution
$1$ man, $5$ women and $14$ children.


Proof
Let $m$, $w$ and $c$ denote the number of men, women and children respectively.
We have:














\(\ds 3 m + 2 w + \dfrac c 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)





apportioning the measures of grain




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 m + 4 w + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds m + w + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)





the total number of people




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 m + 3 w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)





$(1) - (2)$



We note that $5 m$ is a multiple of $5$.
Hence $3 w$ also has to be a multiple of $5$.
Thus $w$ has to be a multiple of $5$.
Hence the following possible solutions for $m$ and $w$:














\(\ds w = 0\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 4\)




















\(\ds w = 5\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 1\)









It is implicit that there are at least some women in the household, so the solution:

$m = 4, w = 0, c = 16$
is usually ruled out.
Hence we have:

$m = 1, w = 5, c = 14$
$\blacksquare$

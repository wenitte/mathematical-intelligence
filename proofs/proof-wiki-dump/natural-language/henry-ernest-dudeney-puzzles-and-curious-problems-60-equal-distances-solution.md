Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $60$
Equal Distances
At what time between three and four o'clock is the minute hand the same distance from $\text {VIII}$ as the hour hand is from $\text {XII}$?


Solution
$23 \tfrac 1 {13}$ past $3$.



Proof
Let $T$ be the time in question.
Let $m$ be the number of minutes past $3:00$ that $T$ is.
Let $\theta \degrees$ be the angle made by the minute hand with respect to twelve o'clock at time $T$.
Let $\phi \degrees$ be the angle made by the hour hand with respect to twelve o'clock at time $T$.
Between $3:00$ and $4:00$ we have that $90 < \phi < 120$.
Hence from Condition for Valid Time Indication, we have that:

$12 \paren {\phi - 90} = \theta$
Then we are told that:

$\size {240 - \theta} = \phi$

This can mean that:

$240 - \theta = \phi$
in which case:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 240 - \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \phi\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 12 \paren {\phi - 90}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \theta\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 12 \paren {240 - \theta - 90}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \theta\)





substituting for $\phi$ in $(2)$ from $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 13 \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12 \times 150\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12 \times 150} {13}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {12 \times 150} {13} \times \dfrac 1 6\)





Speed of Minute Hand














\(\ds \)

\(\ds 23 \tfrac 1 {13}\)





calculating




Or it can mean that:

$\theta - 240 = \phi$
in which case:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \theta - 240\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \phi\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 12 \paren {\phi - 90}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \theta\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 12 \paren {\theta - 240 - 90}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \theta\)





substituting for $\phi$ in $(2)$ from $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 11 \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12 \times 330\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 360\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60\)





Speed of Minute Hand



But in this case $T = 4:00$, which is not (strictly) between $3:00$ and $4:00$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

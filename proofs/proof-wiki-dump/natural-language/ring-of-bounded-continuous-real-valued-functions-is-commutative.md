Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $\struct {\map {C^*} {S, \R}, +, *}$ be the ring of bounded continuous real-valued functions from $S$.

Then:

$\struct{\map {C^*} {S, \R}, +, *}$ is a commutative ring


Proof
Let $\struct{\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ be the ring of continuous real-valued functions from $S$.
From Ring of Bounded Continuous Functions is Subring of Continuous Real-Valued Functions:

$\struct{\map {C^*} {S, \R}, +, *}$ is a subring of $\struct{\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$
From Ring of Continuous Real-Valued Functions is Commutative:

$\struct{\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ is a commutative ring
From Subring of Commutative Ring is Commutative:

$\struct{\map {C^*} {S, \R}, +, *}$ is a commutative ring
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\LL$ be a straight line such that:

the perpendicular distance from $\LL$ to the origin is $p$
the angle made between that perpendicular and the $x$-axis is $\alpha$.

Then $\LL$ can be defined by the equation:

$x \cos \alpha + y \sin \alpha = p$


Proof


Let $A$ be the $x$-intercept of $\LL$.
Let $B$ be the $y$-intercept of $\LL$.

Let $A = \tuple {a, 0}$ and $B = \tuple {0, b}$.
From the Equation of Straight Line in Plane: Two-Intercept Form, $\LL$ can be expressed in the form:

$(1): \quad \dfrac x a + \dfrac y a = 1$

Then:

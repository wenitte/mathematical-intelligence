Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a discrete topological space.
Let $T$ be separable.

Then $S$ is countable.


Proof
Let $T$ be separable.
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $S$ is uncountable.
Then by Uncountable Discrete Space is not Separable, $T$ is not separable.
Hence the result by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

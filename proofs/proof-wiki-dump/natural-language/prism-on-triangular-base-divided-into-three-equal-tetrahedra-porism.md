Porism to Prism on Triangular Base divided into Three Equal Tetrahedra
In the words of Euclid:

From this it is manifest that any pyramid is a third part of a prism which has the same base with it and equal height.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XII}$: Proposition $7$ : Porism)


Proof
Apparent from the construction.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $7$ of Book $\text{XII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

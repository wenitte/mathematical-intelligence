Theorem
  
Let $B$ be a body under constant acceleration $\mathbf a$.
Then:

$\mathbf v = \mathbf u + \mathbf a t$

where:

$\mathbf u$ is the velocity at time $t = 0$
$\mathbf v$ is the velocity at time $t$.


Proof
By definition of acceleration:

$\dfrac {\d \mathbf v} {\d t} = \mathbf a$
By Solution to Linear First Order Ordinary Differential Equation:

$\mathbf v = \mathbf c + \mathbf a t$
where $\mathbf c$ is a constant vector.
We are given the initial condition:

$\bigvalueat {\mathbf v} {t \mathop = 0} = \mathbf u$
from which it follows immediately that:

$\mathbf v = \mathbf u + \mathbf a t$
$\blacksquare$

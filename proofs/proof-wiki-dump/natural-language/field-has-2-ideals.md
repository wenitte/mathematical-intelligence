Theorem
Let $\struct {F, +, \circ}$ be a field whose zero is $0_F$ and whose unity is $1_F$.
Then the only ideals of $\struct {F, +, \circ}$ are $\struct {F, +}$ and $\set {0_F}$.

That is, $\struct {F, +, \circ}$ has no non-null proper ideals.


Proof
By definition, a field is a division ring.
From Null Ring is Ideal and Ring is Ideal of Itself, it is always the case that $\set {0_F}$ and $\struct {F, +}$ are ideals of $\struct {F, +, \circ}$.
From Ideals of Division Ring, it follows that the only ideals of $\struct {F, +, \circ}$ are $\struct {F, +}$ and $\set {0_F}$.
$\blacksquare$

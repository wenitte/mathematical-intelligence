Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

And it is made manifest to us by this also that it is possible for a rational area to be contained by irrational straight lines.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $114$ : Porism)


Proof
Directly apparent from the construction.

Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $114$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

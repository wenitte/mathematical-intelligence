Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $\ds \sum_{n \mathop = m}^\infty d_n p^n$ be a $p$-adic expansion.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic Numbers.

Then the sequence of partial sums of the series:

$\ds \sum_{n \mathop = m}^\infty d_n p^n$
represents a $p$-adic number of $\struct {\Q_p,\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$.


Proof
From P-adic Expansion is a Cauchy Sequence in P-adic Norm, the sequence of partial sums of the series:

$\ds \sum_{n \mathop = m}^\infty d_n p^n$
is a Cauchy Sequence.
Then the sequence of partial sums of the series:

$\ds \sum_{n \mathop = m}^\infty d_n p^n$
is a representative of a $p$-adic number by definition.
$\blacksquare$

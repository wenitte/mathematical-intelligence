Theorem
Let $S$ be a sphere.
Let $\bigcirc FCD$ be a small circle on $S$.
Let $C$ and $D$ be the points on $\bigcirc FCD$ such that $CD$ is the arc of $\bigcirc FCD$ whose length is to be determined.


Construction
Let $P$ and $Q$ be the poles of $\bigcirc FCD$.
Let $\bigcirc PCQ$ and $\bigcirc PDQ$ be great circles on $S$.
Let $\bigcirc EAB$ be the great circle whose poles are $P$ and $Q$.
Let $A$ and $B$ be the points on $\bigcirc EAB$ which intersect $\bigcirc PCQ$ and $\bigcirc PDQ$.

The length of the arc $CD$ of $\bigcirc FCD$ is given by:

$CD = AB \cos AC$
or:

$CD = AB \sin PC$


Proof

Let $R$ denote the center of $\bigcirc FCD$.
Let $O$ denote the center of $S$, which is also the center of $\bigcirc EAB$.
We have:

$CD = RC \times \angle CRD$
Similarly:

$AB = OA \times \angle AOB$
By Circles with Same Poles are Parallel:

$\bigcirc FCD \parallel \bigcirc EAB$

Hence $RC$ and $RD$ are parallel to $OA$ and $OB$ respectively.
Thus:














\(\ds \angle CRD\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle AOB\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds CD\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {RC} {OA} AB\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {RC} {OC} AB\)





as $OA = OC$ are both radii of $S$




We also have that:














\(\ds RC\)

\(\perp\)







\(\ds OR\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds RC\)

\(=\)







\(\ds OC \cos \angle RCO\)










and that:














\(\ds RC\)

\(\parallel\)







\(\ds OA\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \angle RCO\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle AOC\)









We have that $\angle AOC$ is the (plane) angle subtended at $O$ by the arc $AC$ of $\bigcirc EAB$.

Thus:














\(\ds CD\)

\(=\)







\(\ds AB \cos AC\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds AB \, \map \cos {PA - PC}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds AB \sin PC\)





as $PA$ is a right angle, and Cosine of Complement equals Sine‎




Hence the result.

Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $24$
De Campo Triangulo
A Triangular Field
A triangular field is $30$ perches along $2$ sides
and $18$ perches along the bottom.
How many acres must be enclosed?


Solution
Join the $2$ long sides and make $60$.
Half of $60$ is $30$.
Because the bottom is $18$, take half of this which is $9$.
$9$ times $30$ is $270$.
Divide $270$ by $12$ which makes $22 \tfrac 1 2$.
Again divide by $12$, giving $1$ acre and $12$ perches.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
When the answer is given in perches, it is clear that square perches is really meant.
Note that the acre as given is defined as $144$ square perches rather than the modern definition as $160$ of them.

As David Singmaster points out, the answer is in fact numerically incorrect: $22 \frac 1 2$ acre is in fact $126$ square perches.

However, using Heron's Formula:

$\AA = \sqrt {s \paren {s - a} \paren {s - b} \paren {s - c} }$
where:














\(\ds s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {30 + 30 + 18} 2\)

\(\ds = 39\)


















\(\ds s - a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 39 - 30\)

\(\ds = 9\)


















\(\ds s - b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 39 - 30\)

\(\ds = 9\)


















\(\ds s - b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 39 - 18\)

\(\ds = 21\)







we obtain:














\(\ds \AA\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {39 \times 9 \times 9 \times 21}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {66 \, 339}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\approx\)







\(\ds 257.56\)









At $144$ square perches to the acre, this equals $1$ acre and $113.56$ square perches.

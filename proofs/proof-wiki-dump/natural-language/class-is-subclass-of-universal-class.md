Theorem
Let $V$ denote the universal class.
Let $A$ be a class.

Then $A$ is a subclass of $V$.


Proof
By definition of class, $A$ is a collection of sets.
Let $x \in A$ be a set.
By definition of universal class, $V$ contains all sets as elements.
Hence $x \in V$.
So we have that:

$x \in A \implies x \in V$
and the result follows by definition of subclass.
$\blacksquare$

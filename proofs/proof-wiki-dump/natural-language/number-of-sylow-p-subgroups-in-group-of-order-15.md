Theorem
Let $G$ be a group whose order is $15$.
Then:

the number of Sylow $3$-subgroups is in the set $\set {1, 4, 7, \ldots}$
the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups is in the set $\set {1, 6, 11, \ldots}$


Proof
Let $G$ be a group of order $15$.
From the Fourth Sylow Theorem:

the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups is equivalent to $1 \pmod p$
We have that $15 = 3 \times 5$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

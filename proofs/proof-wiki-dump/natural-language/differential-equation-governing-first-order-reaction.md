Theorem
Let a substance decompose spontaneously in a first-order reaction.

The differential equation which governs this reaction is given by:

$-\dfrac {\d x} {\d t} = k x$
where:

$x$ determines the quantity of substance at time $t$.
$k \in \R_{>0}$.


Proof
From the definition of a first-order reaction, the rate of change of the quantity of the substance is proportional to the quantity of the substance present at any time.
As the rate of change is a decrease, this rate will be negative.

Thus the differential equation governing this reaction is given by:

$-\dfrac {\d x} {\d t} = k x$
for some $k \in \R_{>0}$.
$\blacksquare$

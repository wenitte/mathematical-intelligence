Theorem
$S \setminus \paren {T_1 \cup T_2} = \paren {S \setminus T_1} \cap \paren {S \setminus T_2}$


Proof
Demonstration by Venn diagram:


The area in orange and red is the set difference of $S$ with $T_1$
The area in orange and yellow is set difference of $S$ with $T_2$
The area in orange only is the set difference of $S$ with the union of $T_1$ and $T_2$.
It is also seen to be the intersection of the set difference of $S$ with $T_1$ and the set difference of $S$ with $T_2$.
$\blacksquare$

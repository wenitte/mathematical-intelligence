Theorem
Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be connectedness properties and let:

$P_1 \implies P_2$
mean:

If a topological space $T$ satsifies property $P_1$, then $T$ also satisfies property $P_2$.

Then the following sequence of implications holds:











Ultraconnected









$\Big\Downarrow$



Arc-Connected


$\implies$


Path-Connected









$\Big\Downarrow$



Irreducible


$\implies$


Connected





Proof
The relevant justifications are listed as follows:

Ultraconnected Space is Path-Connected
Arc-Connected Space is Path-Connected
Path-Connected Space is Connected
Irreducible Space is Connected
$\blacksquare$

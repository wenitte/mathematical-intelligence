Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a Fortissimo space.
Let $T \times D$ be the double pointed topology on $T$.

Then $T \times D$ is weakly countably compact.


Proof
Let $D = \set {0, 1}$.
Let $\tuple {p, 0}$ belong to some infinite $A \subseteq S$.
Then its twin $\tuple {p, 1}$ is a limit point of $A$.
Hence the result by definition of weakly countably compact.
$\blacksquare$

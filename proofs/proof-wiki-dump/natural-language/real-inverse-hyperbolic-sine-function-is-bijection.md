Theorem
The real inverse hyperbolic sine is a bijection.


Proof
From Hyperbolic Sine is Bijection over Reals and by definition of bijection, we have that $\sinh$ admits an inverse function over $\R$.
From:

Domain of Bijection is Codomain of Inverse
Codomain of Bijection is Domain of Inverse
the domain and image of hyperbolic sine over $\R$, is $\R$.
$\blacksquare$

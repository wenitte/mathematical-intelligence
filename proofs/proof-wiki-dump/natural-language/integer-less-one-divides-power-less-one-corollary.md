Corollary to Integer Less One divides Power Less One
Let $m, n, q \in \Z_{>0}$.
Let:

$m \divides n$
where $\divides$ denotes divisibility.
Then:

$\paren {q^m - 1} \divides \paren {q^n - 1}$


Converse to Corollary
Let $m, n, q \in \Z_{>0}$.
Let

$\paren {q^m - 1} \divides \paren {q^n - 1}$
where $\divides$ denotes divisibility.
Then:

$m \divides n$


Proof
By hypothesis:

$m \divides n$
By definition of divisibility:

$\exists k \in \Z: k m = n$
Thus:

$q^n = q^{k m} = \paren {q^m}^k$

Then by Integer Less One divides Power Less One:

$\paren {q^m - 1} \divides \paren {\paren {q^m}^k - 1}$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

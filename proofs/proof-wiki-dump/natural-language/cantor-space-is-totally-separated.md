Theorem
Let $T = \struct {\CC, \tau_d}$ be the Cantor space.

Then $T$ is totally separated.


Proof
Let $a, b \in \CC$ such that $a < b$.
Then $b - a = \epsilon$.
Consider $n \in \N$ such that $3^{-n} < \epsilon$.


Work In ProgressIn particular: To be proved that between $a + 3^{-\paren {n + 1} }$ and $a + 2 \times 3^{-\paren {n + 1} }$ there exists an interval $I$ which is excluded from $\CC$. Or something like that.Then we pick some $r \in I$ and continue as follows.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by completing it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{WIP}} from the code.
So $\exists r \in \R: a < r < b, r \notin \CC$.
Let $A = \CC \cap \hointr 0 r$ and $B = \CC \cap \hointl r 1$.
Thus $A \mid B$ is a separation of $\CC$ such that $a \in A, b \in B$.
Such a separation can be found for any two distinct $a, b \in \CC$.
Hence the result by definition of totally separated.

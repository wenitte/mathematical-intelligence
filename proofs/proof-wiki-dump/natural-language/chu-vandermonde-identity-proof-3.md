Theorem
$\ds \sum_{k \mathop = 0}^n \binom r k \binom s {n - k} = \binom {r + s} n$


Informal Proof
The right hand side can be thought of as the number of ways to select $n$ people from among $r$ men and $s$ women.
Each term in the left hand side is the number of ways to choose $k$ of the men and $n - k$ of the women.
$\blacksquare$

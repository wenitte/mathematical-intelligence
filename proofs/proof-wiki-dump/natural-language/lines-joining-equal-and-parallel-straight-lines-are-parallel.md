Theorem
The straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines at their endpoints, in the same direction, are themselves equal and parallel.

In the words of Euclid:

The straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines (at the extremities which are) in the same direction (respectively) are themselves equal and parallel.
(The Elements: Book $\text{I}$: Proposition $33$)


Proof

Let $AB, CD$ be equal and parallel.
Let $AC, BD$ join their endpoints in the same direction.

Draw $BC$.
From Parallelism implies Equal Alternate Angles:

$\angle ABC = \angle BCD$

We have that $AB, BC$ are equal to $DC, CB$ and $\angle ABC = \angle BCD$.
It follows from Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence that $AC = BD$.

Also, $\triangle ABC = \triangle DCB$, and thus $\angle ACB = \angle CBD$.
We have that $BC$ falling on the two straight lines $AC, BD$ makes the alternate angles equal.
Therefore from Equal Alternate Angles implies Parallel Lines:

$AC \parallel BD$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $33$ of Book $\text{I}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

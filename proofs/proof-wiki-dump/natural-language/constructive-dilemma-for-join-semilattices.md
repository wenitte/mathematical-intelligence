Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \vee, \preceq}$ be a join semilattice.
Let $a, b, c, d \in S$.
Let $a \preceq b$.
Let $c \preceq d$.

Then $\paren {a \vee c} \preceq \paren {b \vee d}$.


Proof
By Join Semilattice is Ordered Structure, $\preceq$ is compatible with $\vee$.
By the definition of ordering, $\preceq$ is transitive.
Thus the theorem holds by Operating on Transitive Relationships Compatible with Operation.

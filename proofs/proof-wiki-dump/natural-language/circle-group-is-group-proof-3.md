Theorem
The circle group $\struct {K, \times}$ is a group.


Proof
Taking the group axioms in turn:


Group Axiom $\text G 0$: Closure













\(\ds z, w\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds K\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \cmod z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 = \cmod w\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \cmod {z w}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cmod z \cmod w\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds z w\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds K\)









So $\struct {K, \times}$ is closed.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 1$: Associativity
Complex Multiplication is Associative.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 2$: Existence of Identity Element
From Complex Multiplication Identity is One we have that the identity element of $K$ is $1 + 0 i$.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 3$: Existence of Inverse Element
We have that:

$\cmod z = 1 \implies \dfrac 1 {\cmod z} = \cmod {\dfrac 1 z} = 1$
But:

$z \times \dfrac 1 z = 1 + 0 i$
So the inverse of $z$ is $\dfrac 1 z$.
$\Box$

All the group axioms are satisfied, and the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

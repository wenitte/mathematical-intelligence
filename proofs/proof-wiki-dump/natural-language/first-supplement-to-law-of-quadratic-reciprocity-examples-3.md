Examples of First Supplement to Law of Quadratic Reciprocity
$-1$ is a quadratic non-residue of $3$.


Proof
From Quadratic Residues of 3:

there exists exactly $1$ quadratic residue modulo $3$, and that is $1$.
We also have that:

$3 = 4 \times 1 - 1$
and so is not of the form $4 n + 1$.
$\blacksquare$

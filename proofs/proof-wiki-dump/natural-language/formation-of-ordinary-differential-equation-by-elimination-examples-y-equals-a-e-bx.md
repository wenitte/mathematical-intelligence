Examples of Formation of Ordinary Differential Equation by Elimination
Consider the equation:

$(1): \quad y = A e^{B x}$

This can be expressed as the ordinary differential equation of order $2$:

$\dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2} + 9 y = 0$


Proof
Differentiating twice with respect to $x$:














\(\ds \dfrac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds B A e^{B x}\)





Derivative of Exponential Function




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds B y\)





Derivative of Exponential Function








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds B \dfrac {\d y} {\d x}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\paren {\frac {\d y} {\d x} }^2} y\)





substituting for $B$ from $2$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y \cdot \dfrac {\d^2 y} {\d x^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\frac {\d y} {\d x} }^2\)





simplifying

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau}$ be a completely metrizable topological space.
Then, $\struct {S, \tau}$ is a metrizable topological space.


Proof
Since $\struct {S, \tau}$ is completely metrizable, $\tau$ is induced by a (complete) metric $d$.
In particular, $\struct {S, d}$ is a metric space.
As $\struct {S, \tau}$ is homeomorphic to itself by the identity mapping, it is metrizable.

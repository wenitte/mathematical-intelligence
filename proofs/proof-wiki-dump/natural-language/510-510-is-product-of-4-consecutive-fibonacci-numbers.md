Theorem
$510 \, 510$ can be expressed as the product of $4$ distinct consecutive Fibonacci numbers:

$510 \, 510 = 13 \times 21 \times 34 \times 55$
and is also the $7$th primorial:

$510 \, 510 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 17$


Proof
By observation:














\(\ds 510 \, 510\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13 \times 21 \times 34 \times 55\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13 \times \paren {3 \times 7} \times \paren {2 \times 17} \times \paren {5 \times 11}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 17\)









$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
David Wells report in his $1997$ work Curious and Interesting Numbers, 2nd ed. that this result can be found in an article by Monte James Zerger in Journal of Recreational Mathematics volume $12$, but this has not been corroborated.

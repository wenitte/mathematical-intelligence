Definition
Let $\struct {X, \norm \cdot}$ be a normed vector space over $\R$. 
Let $U \subseteq X$. 
Let $C$ be the closed convex hull of $U$. 

Then: 

$C$ is convex.


Proof
From the definition of closed convex hull, we have: 

$C$ is the closure of the convex hull $\map {\operatorname {conv} } U$ of $U$.
From Convex Hull is Smallest Convex Set containing Set, we have: 

$\map {\operatorname {conv} } U$ is convex.
So, from Closure of Convex Subset in Normed Vector Space is Convex, we have: 

$C$ is convex.

Examples of Reduced Residue Systems
The arithmetic sequence:

$\set {5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35}$
does not form a reduced residue system modulo $18$.


Proof
We have:














\(\ds 23\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 \times 18 + 5\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 5\)

\(\ds \pmod {18}\)


















\(\ds 29\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 \times 18 + 11\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 11\)

\(\ds \pmod {18}\)


















\(\ds 35\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 \times 18 + 17\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 17\)

\(\ds \pmod {18}\)







Thus we see that:

$\set {5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35}$
is equivalent to:

$\set {1, 5, 17}$

While $\set {1, 5, 17}$ are all coprime to $18$, they do not form a least positive reduced residue system modulo $18$, which is:

$\set {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}$
from Least Positive Reduced Residue System Modulo 18.

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau }$ be a topological space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $\struct{\map C {S, R}, \vee, \wedge, \le}$ be the lattice of continuous real-valued functions from $S$.
Let $\struct{\map {C^*} {S, R}, \vee, \wedge, \le}$ be the lattice of bounded continuous real-valued functions from $S$.

Then:

$\struct{\map {C^*} {S, R}, \vee, \wedge, \le}$ is a sublattice of $\struct{\map C {S, R}, \vee, \wedge, \le}$


Proof
To show that $\struct{\map {C^*} {S, R}, \vee, \wedge, \le}$ is a sublattice of $\struct {\map C {S, R}, \vee, \wedge, \le}$ it is sufficient to show that $\map {C^*} {S, R}$ is closed under $\vee$ and $\wedge$.

From Maximum Rule for Bounded Continuous Real-Valued Functions:

$\map {C^*} {S, R}$ is closed under $\vee$
From Minimum Rule for Bounded Continuous Real-Valued Functions:

$\map {C^*} {S, R}$ is closed under $\wedge$
$\blacksquare$

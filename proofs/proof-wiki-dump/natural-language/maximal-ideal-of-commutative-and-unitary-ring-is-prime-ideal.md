Theorem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $M$ be a maximal ideal of $R$.

Then $M$ is a prime ideal of $R$.


Proof
From Maximal Ideal iff Quotient Ring is Field:

the quotient ring $R / M$ is a field.
It follows from Field is Integral Domain that $R / M$ is an integral domain.
Finally it follows from Prime Ideal iff Quotient Ring is Integral Domain that $M$ is a prime ideal.
$\blacksquare$

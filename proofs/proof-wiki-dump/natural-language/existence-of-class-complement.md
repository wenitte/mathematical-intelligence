Theorem
Let $X$ be a class.
Then there is a unique class $Z$ such that, for every set $u$:

$u \in Z \iff u \notin X$


Proof
Let $X$ be arbitrary.
By Axiom $\text B 3$, there is a class $Z$ such that:

$\forall u: u \in Z \iff u \notin X$
This satisfies the existence portion of the theorem.
$\Box$

Let $Z'$ be a class such that:

$\forall u: u \in Z' \iff u \notin X$
Then, for every set $u$:

$u \in Z \iff u \notin X \iff u \in Z'$
Therefore, by the Axiom of Extension:

$Z = Z'$
satisfying the uniqueness portion of the theorem.

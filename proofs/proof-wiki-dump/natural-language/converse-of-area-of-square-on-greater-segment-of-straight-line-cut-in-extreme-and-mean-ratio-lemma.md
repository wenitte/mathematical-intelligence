Lemma to Converse of Area of Square on Greater Segment of Straight Line cut in Extreme and Mean Ratio
In the words of Euclid:

That the double of $AC$ is greater than $BC$ is to be proved thus.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XIII}$: Proposition $2$ : Lemma)


Proof

Suppose that $BC = 2 \cdot CA$.
Therefore:

$BC^2 = 4 \cdot CA^2$
Therefore:

$BC^2 + CA^2 = 5 CA^2$
But by hypothesis:

$BA^2 = 5 CA^2$
Therefore by Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{II} $: Areas of Triangles and Parallelograms Proportional to Base:

$BA^2 = BC^2 + CA^2$
which is impossible.
Therefore:

$BC \ne 2 \cdot CA$
Similarly it can be shown that it is not the case that:

$BC < 2 \cdot CA$
as it leads to a much greater absurdity.
Therefore:

$BC > 2 \cdot CA$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $2$ of Book $\text{XIII}$ of Euclid's The Elements. Heiberg has reason to believe that this lemma is spurious.

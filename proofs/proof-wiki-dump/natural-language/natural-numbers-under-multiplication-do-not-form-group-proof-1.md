Theorem
The algebraic structure $\struct {\N, \times}$ consisting of the set of natural numbers $\N$ under multiplication $\times$ is not a group.


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose that $\struct {\N, \times}$ is a group.
By the definition of the number $0 \in \N$:

$\forall n \in \N: n \times 0 = 0 = 0 \times n$
Thus $0$ is a zero in the abstract algebraic sense.
From Group with Zero Element is Trivial, $\struct {\N, \times}$ is the trivial group.
But $\N$ contains other elements besides $0$.
From this contradiction it follows that $\struct {\N, \times}$ is not a group.
$\blacksquare$

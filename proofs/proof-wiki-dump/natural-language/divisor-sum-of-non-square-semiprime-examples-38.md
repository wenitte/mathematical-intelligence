Example of Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime
$\map {\sigma_1} {38} = 60$
where $\sigma_1$ denotes the divisor sum function.


Proof
We have that:

$38 = 2 \times 19$
and so by definition is a semiprime whose prime factors are distinct.

Hence:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {38}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2 + 1} \paren {19 + 1}\)





Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 20\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60\)

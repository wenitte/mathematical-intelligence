Example of Integers such that Difference with Power of 2 is always Prime
The positive integer $21$ has the property that such that:

$\forall k > 0: 21 - 2^k$
is prime whenever it is (strictly) positive.


Proof













\(\ds 21 - 2^1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 19\)





which is prime














\(\ds 21 - 2^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 17\)





which is prime














\(\ds 21 - 2^3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13\)





which is prime














\(\ds 21 - 2^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)





which is prime














\(\ds 21 - 2^5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -9\)





which is not positive



$\blacksquare$

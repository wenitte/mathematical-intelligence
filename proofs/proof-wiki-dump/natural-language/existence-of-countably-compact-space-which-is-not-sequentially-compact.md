Theorem
There exists at least one example of a countably compact topological space which is not also a sequentially compact space.


Proof
Let $T := \hointr 0 \Omega \times \mathbb I^{\mathbb I}$ be the Cartesian product of $\hointr 0 \Omega$ under the interval topology, with the uncountable Cartesian product of the closed unit interval under the usual (Euclidean) topology.

From Product of Uncountable Ordinal Interval Space with Uncountable Cartesian Product of Closed Unit Interval is Countably Compact, $T$ is a countably compact space.
From Product of Uncountable Ordinal Interval Space with Uncountable Cartesian Product of Closed Unit Interval is not Sequentially Compact, $T$ is not a sequentially compact space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

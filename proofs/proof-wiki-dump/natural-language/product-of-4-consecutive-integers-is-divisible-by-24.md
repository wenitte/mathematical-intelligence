Theorem
Let $a, b, c, d \in \Z$ be consecutive integers.
Then their product $a b c d$ is divisible by $24$.


Proof
This is an application of Divisibility of Product of Consecutive Integers with $n = 4$.
By the theorem, the product of $4$ consecutive integers is divisible by $4! = 24$.
$\blacksquare$

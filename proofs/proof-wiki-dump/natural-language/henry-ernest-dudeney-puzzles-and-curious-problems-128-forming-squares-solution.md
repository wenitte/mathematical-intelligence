Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $128$
Forming Squares
An officer arranged his men in a solid square, and had $39$ men left over.
He then started increasing the number of men on a side by one, but found that $50$ new men would be needed to complete the new square.
Can you tell me how many men the officer had?


Solution
$1975$ men.


Proof
Let the original square have $n$ men on each side.
Then we have:














\(\ds \paren {n + 1}^2 - n^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 39 + 50\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 89\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 n + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 89\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 44\)









So the officer had $44^2 + 39 = 1975$ men.
$\blacksquare$

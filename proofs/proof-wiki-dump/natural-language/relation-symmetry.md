Theorem
Every non-null relation has exactly one of these properties: it is either:

symmetric,
asymmetric or
non-symmetric.


Proof
From Relation both Symmetric and Asymmetric is Null, the empty set is both symmetric and asymmetric.
This is why the assumption that $\RR \ne \O$.

Let $\RR$ be symmetric.
Then $\RR$ is not asymmetric by definition.
Also, $\RR$ is not non-symmetric by definition.

Let $\RR$ be asymmetric.
Then $\RR$ is not symmetric by definition.
Also, $\RR$ is not non-symmetric by definition.

If $\RR$ is not symmetric, and $\RR$ is not asymmetric, then $\RR$ is non-symmetric by definition.
$\blacksquare$

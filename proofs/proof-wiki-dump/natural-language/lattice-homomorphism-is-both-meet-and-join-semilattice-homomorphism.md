Theorem
Let $L_1 = \struct{S_1, \vee_1, \wedge_1, \preceq_1}$ and $L_2 = \struct{S_2, \vee_2, \wedge_2, \preceq_2}$ be lattices.

Let $\phi: L_1 \to L_2$ be a lattice homomorphsm between $L_1$ and $L_2$.

Then:

$\phi: \struct{S_1, \vee_1, \preceq_1} \to \struct{S_2, \vee_2, \preceq_2}$
$\phi: \struct{S_1, \wedge_1, \preceq_1} \to \struct{S_2, \wedge_2, \preceq_2}$
are semilattice homomorphisms


Proof
This follows immediately from:

Definition:Lattice (Order Theory)
Definition:Semilattice
Definition:Lattice Homomorphism
Definition:Semilattice Homomorphism

$\blacksquare$

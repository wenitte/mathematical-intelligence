Theorem
The only Fibonacci numbers which equal their index are:














\(\ds F_0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds F_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)




















\(\ds F_5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)











Proof
By definition of the Fibonacci numbers:














\(\ds F_0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds F_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)









Then it is observed that $F_5 = 5$.
After that, for $n > 5$, we have that $F_n > n$.

Theorem
Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $\mathfrak a$ be an ideal of $A$.

Then:

$\mathfrak a = A \iff 1 \in \mathfrak a$
where $1$ denotes the unity of $A$.


Proof
$\implies$ is trivial.
To see $\impliedby$, suppose $1 \in \mathfrak a$.
Let $a \in A$ be arbitrary.
Then:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a 1\)





Definition of Identity Element














\(\ds \)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \mathfrak a\)





since $1 \in \mathfrak a$, by Definition of Ideal of Ring



$\blacksquare$

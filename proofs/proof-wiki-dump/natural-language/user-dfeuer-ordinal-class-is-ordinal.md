Theorem
The class of all ordinals $\On$ is an ordinal.


Proof
Let $n \in \On$.
Let $m \in n$.
By Element of Ordinal is Ordinal, $m \in \On$.
Thus $\On$ is a transitive class.
Let $S$ be any non-empty subclass of $\On$.
Let $p$ be an arbitrary element of $S$.

If $p \cap S = \O$ then $p$ is the smallest element of $S$.
Otherwise, $p \cap S$ is a non-empty subset of $p$.

Since $p$ is an ordinal, $p \cap S$ has a smallest element, which will then be the smallest element of $S$.
Therefore, by the definition of ordinal, $\On$ is an ordinal.

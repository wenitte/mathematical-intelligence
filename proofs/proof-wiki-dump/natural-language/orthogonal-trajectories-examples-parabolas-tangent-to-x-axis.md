Theorem
Consider the one-parameter family of curves of parabolas which are tangent to the $x$-axis at the origin:

$(1): \quad y = c x^2$

Its family of orthogonal trajectories is given by the equation:

$x^2 + 2 y^2 = c$





Proof
We use the technique of formation of ordinary differential equation by elimination.
Differentiating $(1)$ with respect to $x$ gives:

$x \dfrac {\d y} {\d x} + y = 0$



\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 c x\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\frac {2 y} x\)





eliminating $c$ between $(1)$ and $(2)$




Thus from Orthogonal Trajectories of One-Parameter Family of Curves, the family of orthogonal trajectories is given by:

$\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} = -\dfrac x {2 y}$

So:














\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac x {2 y}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \int x \rd x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -2 \int y \rd y\)





Solution to Separable Differential Equation








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -2 y^2 + c\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 + 2 y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c\)









Hence the result.

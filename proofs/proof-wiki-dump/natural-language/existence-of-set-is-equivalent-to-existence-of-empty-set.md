Theorem
Let $V$ be a basic universe.

Let $P$ be the axiom:

$V$ has at least one element.

Then $P$ is equivalent to the Axiom of the Empty Set:

The empty class $\O$ is a set.


Proof
Necessary Condition
Let the Axiom of the Empty Set hold.
That is:

$\O$ is a set.
By definition of a basic universe, $V$ is a universal class.
Hence, by definition, every set is an element of $V$.
We have that $\O$ is a set by hypothesis.
Thus:

$\O \in V$
and by definition of empty class it is seen that $V$ is not empty.
$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Let $V$ have at least one element.
Let $x \in V$ be an element of $V$.
Then by the Axiom of Transitivity $x$ is also a class.
By Empty Class is Subclass of All Classes:

$\O \subseteq x$
By the Axiom of Swelledness, every subclass of $x$ is an element of $V$.
That includes $\O$.
Thus:

$\O \in V$
By definition of a basic universe, $V$ is a fortiori a universal class.
Hence all of its elements are by definition sets.
Hence it follows that $\O$ is a set.
$\blacksquare$

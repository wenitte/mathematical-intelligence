Corollary to Relation between Two Ordinals
Let $S$ and $T$ be ordinals.
If $S \ne T$, then either $S$ is an initial segment of $T$, or vice versa.


Proof
We have that $S \ne T$
Therefore, from Relation between Two Ordinals either $S \subset T$ or $T \subset S$.
By Ordering on Ordinal is Subset Relation or Transitive Set is Proper Subset of Ordinal iff Element of Ordinal, either $S \in T$ or $T \in S$.
By definition, every element of an ordinal is an initial segment; hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\RR \subseteq S \times S$ be a relation which is not null.
Let $\RR$ be antireflexive and transitive.

Then $\RR$ is also antisymmetric.


Proof
Let $\RR \subseteq S \times S$ be antireflexive and transitive.
From Antireflexive and Transitive Relation is Asymmetric it follows that $\RR$ is asymmetric.
The result follows from Asymmetric Relation is Antisymmetric.
$\blacksquare$


Also see
If $\RR = \O$ then Null Relation is Antireflexive, Symmetric and Transitive applies instead.

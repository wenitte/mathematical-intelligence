Goldbach's Lesser Conjecture: $5993$ is a Stern Number
The number $5993$ cannot be represented in the form:

$5993 = 2 a^2 + p$
where:

$a \in \Z_{\ge 0}$ is a non-negative integer
$p$ is a prime number.


Proof
It will be shown that for all $a$ such that $2 a^2 \le 5993$, it is never the case that $5993 - 2 a^2$ is prime.

Thus:

That exhausts all $a$ such that $2 a^2 \le 5993$, as $2 \times 55^2 = 6050$.
Hence the result.

Theorem
Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite group $G$.
Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$.

Then $P N / N$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G / N$.


Proof
We have that $P \le G$ and $ N \lhd G$.
So by the Second Isomorphism Theorem for Groups:

$P N / N \cong P / \paren {P \cap N}$
We have that:

$P N / N = \set {p N : p \in P}$
and so every element of $P N / N$ has order a power of $p$.
Hence $P N / N$ is a $p$-subgroup of $G / N$.

From Intersection of Normal Subgroup with Sylow P-Subgroup, we have that:

$p \nmid \index G {P N}$
So $P N / N$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G / N$.
$\blacksquare$

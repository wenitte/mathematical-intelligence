Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the sixth binomial, the "side" of the area is the irrational straight line called the side of the sum of two medial areas.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $59$)


Proof

Let the rectangular area $ABCD$ be contained by the rational straight line $AB$ and the sixth binomial $AD$.
Let $E$ divide $AD$ into its terms such that $AE > ED$.
Let $E$ divide $AD$ into its terms such that $AE > ED$.
From Proposition $42$ of Book $\text{X} $: Binomial Straight Line is Divisible into Terms Uniquely this is possible at only one place.
By definition of binomial, $AE$ and $ED$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Thus $AE^2$ is greater than $ED^2$ by the square on a straight line which is commensurable with $AE$.
Let $ED$ be bisected at $F$.
Using Proposition $29$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Construction of Parallelogram Equal to Given Figure Exceeding a Parallelogram:

Let a parallelogram be applied to $AE$ equal to $EF^2$ and deficient by a square.
Let the rectangle contained by $AG$ and $GE$ equal to $EF^2$ be applied to $AE$.
By Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{X} $: Condition for Commensurability of Roots of Quadratic Equation:

$AG$ is commensurable in length with $EG$.
Let $GH$, $EK$ and $FL$ be drawn from $G$, $E$ and $F$ parallel to $AB$ and $CD$.
Using Proposition $14$ of Book $\text{II} $: Construction of Square equal to Given Polygon:

let the square $SN$ be constructed equal to the parallelogram $AH$
and:

let the square $NQ$ be constructed equal to the parallelogram $GK$.
Let $SN$ and $NQ$ be placed so that $MN$ is in a straight line with $NO$.
Therefore $RN$ is also in a straight line with $NP$.
Let the parallelogram $SQ$ be completed.
From Lemma to Proposition $54$ of Book $\text{X} $: Root of Area contained by Rational Straight Line and First Binomial:

$SQ$ is a square.
We have that $AD$ is a third binomial straight line.
Therefore $AE$ and $ED$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
We have that the rectangle contained by $AG$ and $GE$ is equal to $EF^2$.
Then by Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Rectangles Contained by Three Proportional Straight Lines:

$AG : EF = EF : EG$
and so by Proposition $1$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Areas of Triangles and Parallelograms Proportional to Base:

$AH : EL = EL : KG$
Therefore $EL$ is a mean proportional between $AH$ and $GK$.
But:

$AH = SN$
and:

$GK = NQ$
therefore $EL$ is a mean proportional between $SN$ and $NQ$.
But from Lemma to Proposition $54$ of Book $\text{X} $: Root of Area contained by Rational Straight Line and First Binomial:

$MR$ is a mean proportional between $SN$ and $NQ$.
Therefore:

$EL = MR$
and so:

$EL = PO$
But:

$AH + GK = SN + NQ$
Therefore:

$AC = SQ$
That is:

$AC$ is an area contained by a rational straight line $AB$ and the first binomial $AD$, while the side of the area $SQ$ is $MO$.
We have that $EA$ is incommensurable in length with $AB$.
Therefore $EA$ and $AB$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Therefore, by definition, $AK = MN^2 + NO^2$ is medial.

We have that:

$ED$ is incommensurable in length with $AB = EK$
So by Proposition $13$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurable Magnitudes are Incommensurable with Same Magnitude:

$FE$ is incommensurable in length with $EK$.
Therefore $FE$ and $EK$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Therefore by definition:

$EL = MR = MN \cdot NO$ is a medial area.
Since:

$AE$ is incommensurable in length with $EF$
by:

Proposition $1$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Areas of Triangles and Parallelograms Proportional to Base:
and:

Proposition $11$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Elements of Proportional Magnitudes:
$AK$ is incommensurable with $EL$.
But:

$AK = MN^2 + NO^2$
and:

$EL = MN \cdot NO$
Therefore:

$MN^2 + NO^2$ is incommensurable with $MN \cdot NO$.
So by definition, $MO$ is the side of the sum of two medial areas.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $59$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $65$: Square on Side of Sum of two Medial Area applied to Rational Straight Line.

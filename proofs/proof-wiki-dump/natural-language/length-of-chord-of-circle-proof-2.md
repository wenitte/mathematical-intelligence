Theorem
Let $C$ be a circle of radius $r$.
Let $AB$ be a chord which joins the endpoints of the arc $ADB$.
Then:

$AB = 2 r \sin \dfrac \theta 2$
where $\theta$ is the angle subtended by $AB$ at the center of $C$.


Proof
We have $AO = BO$ since they are radii.
Therefore $\triangle AOB$ is isosceles.
By Isosceles Triangle has Two Equal Angles:

$\angle OAB = \angle OBA$
By Sum of Angles of Triangle equals Two Right Angles:

$\angle OAB + \angle OBA + \theta = 180 \degrees$
Therefore $\angle OAB = \dfrac {180 \degrees - \theta} 2 = 90 \degrees - \dfrac \theta 2$.

Thus:

\(\ds \dfrac {BO} {\sin \angle OAB}\)

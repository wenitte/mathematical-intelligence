Theorem
Let $P = \sequence {a_j}_{0 \mathop \le j \mathop \le n}$ be a geometric sequence of integers.
Then the sequence $Q = \sequence {b_j}_{0 \mathop \le j \mathop \le n}$ defined as:

$\forall j \in \set {0, 1, \ldots, n}: b_j = a_j^m$
where $m \in \Z_{>0}$, is a geometric sequence.

In the words of Euclid:

If there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and each by multiplying itself make some number, the products will be proportional; and, if the original numbers by multiplying the products make certain numbers, the latter will also be proportional.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VIII}$: Proposition $13$)


Proof
From Form of Geometric Sequence of Integers, the $j$th term of $P$ is given by:

$a_j = k q^j p^{n - j}$
Thus the $j$th term of $Q$ is given by:

$b_j = k^m \paren {q^m}^j \paren {p^m}^{n - j}$
From Form of Geometric Sequence of Integers, this is a geometric sequence.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $13$ of Book $\text{VIII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

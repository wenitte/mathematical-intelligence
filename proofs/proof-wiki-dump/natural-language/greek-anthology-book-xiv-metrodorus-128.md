Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
What violence my brother has done me, dividing our father's fortune of five talents unjustly!
Poor tearful I have this fifth part of the seven-elevenths of my brother's share.
Zeus, thou sleepest sound.


Solution
Let $n$ talents be the narrator's share of the fortune.
We have that the brother's share is therefore $5 - n$ talents.
Hence:














\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 5 \paren {\frac 7 {11} \paren {5 - n} }\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 55 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 35 - 7 n\)





multiplying through by $55$ and simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 62 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 35\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {35} {62}\)










So the narrator has $\dfrac {35} {62}$ of a talent.
The brother, meanwhile, has $4 \frac {27} {62}$ talents.
$\blacksquare$


Source of Name
This entry was named for Metrodorus.


Historical Note
The translator plaintively remarks on the solution:

The one offered is that the one brother had $4 \frac 4 {11}$ of a talent, the other $\frac 7 {11}$, but I cannot work it out.
Doubtless, as is apparent in the calculation given here on $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.

This would have been correct had the question been worded:

... I have this fifth part of the seven-elevenths of the total inheritance
but it isn't so it's not.

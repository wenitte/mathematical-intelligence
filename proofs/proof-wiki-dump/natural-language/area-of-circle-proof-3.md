Theorem
The area $A$ of a circle is given by:

$A = \pi r^2$
where $r$ is the radius of the circle.


Proof

Construct a circle with radius $r$ and circumference $c$, whose area is denoted by $C$.
Construct a triangle with height $r$ and base $c$, whose area is denoted by $T$.


Lemma $1$
$T = \pi r^2$
$\Box$


Lemma $2$
$T \ge C$
$\Box$


Lemma $3$
$T \le C$
$\Box$


Final Proof
From Lemma $2$:

$T \ge C$
From Lemma $3$:

$T \le C$
Therefore:

$T \mathop = C$
and so from Lemma $1$:

$C \mathop = T \mathop = \pi r^2$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The area of a circle was determined by Archimedes  in his Measurement of a Circle.

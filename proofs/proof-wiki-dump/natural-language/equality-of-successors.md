Theorem
Let $x$ and $y$ be ordinals.
Let $x^+$ denote the successor set of $x$.
Then, $x = y \iff x^+ = y^+$


Proof













\(\ds x = y\)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds x^+ = y^+\)





Substitutivity of Equality



Conversely,














\(\ds x^+ = y^+\)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds \bigcup x^+ = \bigcup y^+\)





Substitutivity of Equality














\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds x = y\)

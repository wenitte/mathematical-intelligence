Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be an infinite particular point space.

Then $T$ is not weakly countably compact.


Proof
By definition, $T$ is weakly countably compact if and only if every infinite subset of $S$ has a limit point in $S$.

Let $H \subseteq S$ be an infinite subset of $S$ where $p \notin H$.
$H$ is not open in $T$ by definition.
So from Subset of Particular Point Space is either Open or Closed, $H$ is closed in $T$.
Then we have that a Closed Set in Particular Point Space has no Limit Points.
The result follows from definition of weakly countably compact.
$\blacksquare$

If $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ is a finite particular point space, then Finite Space Satisfies All Compactness Properties applies.

Particular Point Space is not Weakly Countably Compact

[A particular point space] $X$ is not weakly countably compact since any set which does not contain $p$ has no limit points.

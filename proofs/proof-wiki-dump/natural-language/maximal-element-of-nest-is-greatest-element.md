Theorem
Let $A$ be a nest.
Let $x$ be a maximal element of $A$.

Then $x$ is the greatest element of $A$.


Proof
Let $x$ be a maximal element of $A$.
Let $y \in A$ be arbitrary such that $x \ne y$.
We have by definition of maximal element that:

$x \not \subset y$
and as $x \ne y$:

$x \nsubseteq y$
But because $A$ is a nest:

$x \subseteq y$ or $y \subseteq x$
from which it follows that it must be the case that:

$y \subseteq x$
As $y$ is arbitrary, the result follows by definition of greatest element.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Every primitive recursive function is a total recursive function.


Proof
A primitive recursive function is a total function, which is apparent from its method of definition.
As the processes for generate a primitive recursive function are a subset of those to generate a recursive function, it follows that a primitive recursive function is also a recursive function.
The result follows from the definition of a total recursive function.

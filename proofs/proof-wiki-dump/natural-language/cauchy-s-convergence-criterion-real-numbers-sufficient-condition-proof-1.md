Theorem
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a sequence in $\R$.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a Cauchy sequence.

Then $\sequence {x_n}$ is convergent.


Proof
Let $\sequence {a_n}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $\R$.
We have the result Real Number Line is Metric Space.
Hence by Convergent Subsequence of Cauchy Sequence, it is sufficient to show that $\sequence {a_n}$ has a convergent subsequence.
Since $\sequence {a_n}$ is Cauchy, by Real Cauchy Sequence is Bounded, it is also bounded.
By the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, $\sequence {a_n}$ has a convergent subsequence.
Hence the result.

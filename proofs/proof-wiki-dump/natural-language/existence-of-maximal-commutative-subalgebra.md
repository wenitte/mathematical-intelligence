Theorem
Let $K$ be a field. 
Let $A$ be an algebra over $K$.
Let $S \subseteq A$ be a non-empty set such that:

for all $x, y \in S$ we have $x y = y x$.

Then there exists a commutative subalgebra of $A$ containing $S$ that is maximal (among all subalgebras) with respect to set inclusion.


Unital
Let $K$ be a field. 
Let $A$ be an unital algebra over $K$.
Let $S \subseteq A$ be a non-empty set such that:

for all $x, y \in S$ we have $x y = y x$.

Then there exists a commutative unital subalgebra of $A$ containing $S$ that is maximal (among all subalgebras) with respect to set inclusion.


Proof
Let $\SS$ be the set commutative subalgebras of $A$ containing $S$. 
We look to apply Zorn's Lemma to $\struct {\SS, \subseteq}$. 
From Subalgebra Generated by Commuting Elements is Commutative, we have $\SS \ne \O$. 
Let $\CC$ be a chain in $\struct {\SS, \subseteq}$.
From Union of Chain of Subalgebras is Subalgebra, $\bigcup \CC$ is a commutative subalgebras of $A$ containing $S$.
We can see that $\bigcup \CC$ is an upper bound for $\CC$ since $A \subseteq \bigcup \CC$ for each $A \in \CC$. 
Hence we have that every chain in $\struct {\SS, \subseteq}$ has an upper bound.
So by Zorn's Lemma, $\struct {\SS, \subseteq}$ has a maximal element $B$.
Now suppose that $C$ is a commutative subalgebras of $A$ with $B \subseteq C$.
Then $C$ in particular contains $S$, so $C \in \CC$. 
Then $C = B$. 
So $B$ is indeed maximal among all subalgebras.

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $76$
How Far Was It?
"The steamer," remarked one of our officers home from the East, "was able to go twenty miles an hour down-stream,
but could only do fifteen miles an hour upstream.
So, of course, she took five hours longer in coming up than in going down."
One could not resist working out mentally the distance from point to point.
What was it?


Solution
$300$ miles.


Proof
Let $D$ be the distance travelled.
Let $T$ be the time taken to travel $D$ downstream.
We have:














\(\ds D\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20 T\)





The steamer was able to go twenty miles an hour down-stream














\(\ds D\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 15 \paren {T + 5}\)





but could only do fifteen miles an hour upstream. So, of course, she took five hours longer in coming up than in going down.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 75\)





eliminating $D$ and simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 15\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds D\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20 \times 15\)





substituting for $T$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 300\)





simplifying

Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
Let $P$ be an arbitrary point in the plane of $\triangle ABC$.
Let the isogonal conjugate of $P$ with respect to to $\triangle ABC$ be denoted $P^{-1}$.
Let $O$ be the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$.
Then the pedal circle of $P$ is tangent to the Feuerbach circle of $\triangle ABC$ if and only if $O$, $P$, $P^{-1}$ are collinear.

By the Second Fontené Theorem we can prove that the second intersection $Q'$ of the circle $O'$ and the circle $E$ is the anti-Steiner point of $OP^{-1}$.
This means $Q' = Q$ if and only if $O P = O P^{-1}$
That is: 

$O$, $P$ and $P^{-1}$ are collinear.

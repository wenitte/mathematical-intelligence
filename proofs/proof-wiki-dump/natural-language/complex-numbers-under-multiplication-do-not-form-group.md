Theorem
The algebraic structure $\struct {\C, \times}$ consisting of the set of complex numbers $\C$ under multiplication $\times$ is not a group.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose that $\struct {\C, \times}$ is a group.
By the definition of the number $0 \in \C$:

$\forall x \in \C: x \times 0 = 0 = 0 \times x$
Thus $0$ is a zero in the abstract algebraic sense.
From Group with Zero Element is Trivial, $\struct {\C, \times}$ is the trivial group.
But $\C$ contains other elements besides $0$.
From this contradiction it follows that $\struct {\C, \times}$ is not a group.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime
$\map {\sigma_1} {35} = 48$
where $\sigma_1$ denotes the divisor sum function.


Proof
We have that:

$35 = 5 \times 7$
and so by definition is a semiprime whose prime factors are distinct.

Hence:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {35}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {5 + 1} \paren {7 + 1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 48\)

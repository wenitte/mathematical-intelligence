Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.

The altitudes of $\triangle ABC$ all intersect at the same point.


Proof 1
From Triangle is Medial Triangle of Larger Triangle, it is possible to construct $\triangle DEF$ such that $\triangle ABC$ is the medial triangle of $\triangle DEF$.
Let $AJ$, $BG$ and $CH$ be the altitudes of $\triangle ABC$.




By definition of medial triangle, $A$, $B$ and $C$ are all midpoints of the sides $DF$, $DE$ and $EF$ of $\triangle DEF$ respectively.
As $DF$, $DE$ and $EF$ are parallel to $BC$, $AC$ and $AB$ respectively, $AJ$, $BG$ and $CH$ are perpendicular to $DF$, $DE$ and $EF$ respectively.
Thus, by definition, $AJ$, $BG$ and $CH$ are the perpendicular bisectors of $DF$, $DE$ and $EF$ respectively.
The result follows from Perpendicular Bisectors of Triangle Meet at Point.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2

In $\triangle ABC$ construct the altitude from vertex $A$ to side $BC$ at $P$.
Also draw the altitude from vertex $B$ to side $AC$ at $Q$.
By Two Straight Lines make Equal Opposite Angles:

$\angle AOQ = \angle BOP$
Given:

$\angle AQO = \angle BPO = $ one right angle.
By Triangles with Two Equal Angles are Similar:

$\triangle AOQ \sim \triangle BOP$
and:

$\triangle AOQ \sim \triangle ACP \sim \triangle BOP$
By the definition of similarity:

$\dfrac {OP} {BP} = \dfrac {CP} {AP}$
Rearrange:

$OP = \dfrac {BP \cdot CP} {AP}$
Note there is no term related to side $AC$.
If we had used side $AB$ instead of $AC$, we would have the same result.
Therefore, the altitude from vertex $C$ to side $AB$ meets both $AP$ and $BQ$ at $O$.
$\blacksquare$

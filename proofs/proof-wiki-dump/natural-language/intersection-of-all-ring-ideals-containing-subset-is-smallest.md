Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a ring
Let $S \subseteq R$ be a subset of $R$.
Let $L$ be the intersection of the set of all ideals of $R$ containing $S$.

Then $L$ is the smallest ideal of $R$ containing $S$. 


Proof
From Intersection of All Subrings Containing Subset is Smallest, $L$ is the smallest subring of $R$ containing $S$.
From Intersection of Ring Ideals is Ideal‎, $L$ is an ideal of $R$.

As $L$ is the smallest subring of $R$ containing $S$, and it is an ideal of $R$, there can be no smaller ideal of $R$ containing $S$ as it would then not be a subring.

So the intersection of the set of all ideals of $R$ containing $S$ is the smallest ideals of $R$ containing $S$. 
$\blacksquare$

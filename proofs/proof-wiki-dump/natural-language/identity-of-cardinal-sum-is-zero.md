Theorem
Let $\mathbf a$ be a cardinal.

Then:

$\mathbf a + \mathbf 0 = \mathbf a$
where $\mathbf a + \mathbf 0$ denotes the sum of the zero cardinal and $\mathbf a$.

That is, $\mathbf 0$ is the identity element of the sum operation on cardinals.


Proof
Let $\mathbf a = \card A$ for some set $A$.
From Union with Empty Set we have $A \cup \O = A$.
From Intersection with Empty Set we have $A \cap \O = \O$.
So $A$ and $\O$ are disjoint and so:














\(\ds \mathbf a + \mathbf 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \card {A \cup \O}\)

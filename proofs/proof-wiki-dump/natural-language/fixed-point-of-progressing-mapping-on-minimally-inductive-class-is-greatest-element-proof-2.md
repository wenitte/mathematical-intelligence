Theorem
Let $M$ be a class which is minimally inductive under a progressing mapping $g$.
Let $x$ be a fixed point of $g$.

Then $x$ is the greatest element of $M$.


Proof
A minimally inductive class under $g$ is the same thing as a minimally closed class under $g$ with respect to $\O$.
The result then follows by a direct application of Fixed Point of Progressing Mapping on Minimally Closed Class is Greatest Element.
$\blacksquare$

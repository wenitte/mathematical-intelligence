Example of Use of Product Rule for Counting
Let $N$ be the number of ways you can choose at least $1$ item of fruit from:

$4$ (indistinguishable) oranges
$3$ (indistinguishable) bananas
$2$ (indistinguishable) apples
Then:

$N = 59$


Proof
You can choose:

$0$, $1$, $2$, $3$ or $4$ oranges, giving you $5$ options
$0$, $1$, $2$ or $3$ bananas, giving you $4$ options
$0$, $1$, or $2$ apples, giving you $3$ options
Each of these options is independent of each other.
Hence the Product Rule for Counting can be applied.
Hence the total number of ways you can choose a selection of fruit from the above is $5 \times 4 \times 3 = 60$.
This includes the option of choosing no items of fruit at all.
We specifically want to exclude that option.
Hence:

$N = 5 \times 4 \times 3 - 1 = 59$
$\blacksquare$

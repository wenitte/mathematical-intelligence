Theorem
Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be groups.
Let $H_1$ and $H_2$ be subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$ respectively.

Let $G_1$ be such that $H_1$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G_1$.
Let $G_2$ be such that $H_2$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G_2$.

Then $H_1 \times H_2$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G_1 \times G_2$.


Proof
From Direct Product of Sylow p-Subgroups is Sylow p-Subgroup, $H_1 \times H_2$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G_1 \times G_2$.
By Sylow $p$-Subgroup is Unique iff Normal, each of $H_1$ and $H_2$ are normal in $G_1$ and $G_2$ respectively.
By Direct Product of Normal Subgroups is Normal, $H_1 \times H_2$ is normal in $G_1 \times G_2$.
Again by Sylow $p$-Subgroup is Unique iff Normal, $H_1 \times H_2$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G_1 \times G_2$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let:

$\struct {G_1, \circ}$
$\struct {G_2, *}$
$\struct {G_3, \oplus}$
be groups.
Let:

$\phi: \struct {G_1, \circ} \to \struct {G_2, *}$
$\psi: \struct {G_2, *} \to \struct {G_3, \oplus}$
be homomorphisms.

Then the composite of $\phi$ and $\psi$ is also a homomorphism.


Proof
A specific instance of Composite of Homomorphisms on Algebraic Structure is Homomorphism.

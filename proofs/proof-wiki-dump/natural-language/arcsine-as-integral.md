Theorem
$\ds \map \arcsin x = \int_0^x \frac {\d x} {\sqrt {1 - x^2} }$


Proof
Lemma 1
Let $\sin_A$ be the analytic sine function for real numbers.
Let $\arcsin_A$ denote the real arcsine function.
Then:

$\ds \map {\arcsin_A} x = \int_0^x \frac {\d x} {\sqrt {1 - x^2} }$
$\Box$


Lemma 2
Let $\sin_G$ be the geometric sine.
$\arcsin_G$ is the inverse of this function.

$\ds \map {\arcsin_G} x = \int_0^x \frac {\d x} {\sqrt {1 - x^2} }$
$\Box$


$\ds \map \arcsin x = \map {\arcsin_A} x = \map {\arcsin_G} x = \int_0^x \frac {\d x} {\sqrt {1 - x^2} }$
$\blacksquare$

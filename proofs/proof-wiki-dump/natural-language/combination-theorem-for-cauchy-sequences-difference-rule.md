Theorem
Let $\struct {R, \norm {\,\cdot\,} }$ be a normed division ring.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$, $\sequence {y_n}$ be Cauchy sequences in $R$.
Then:

$\sequence {x_n - y_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.


Proof
From Multiple Rule for Normed Division Ring Sequences:

$\sequence {-y_n} = \sequence {\paren {-1} y_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.
From Sum Rule for Normed Division Ring Sequences:

$\sequence {x_n - y_n} = \sequence {x_n + \paren {-y_n} }$ is a Cauchy sequence.
$\blacksquare$

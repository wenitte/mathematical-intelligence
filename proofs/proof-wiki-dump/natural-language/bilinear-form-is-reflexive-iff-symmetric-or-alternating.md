Theorem
Let $\mathbb K$ be a field.
Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb K$.
Let $b$ be a bilinear form on $V$.

Then the following are equivalent:

$(1): \quad$ $b$ is reflexive
$(2): \quad$ $b$ is symmetric or alternating


Proof
1 implies 2
Follows from Reflexive Bilinear Form is Symmetric or Alternating
$\blacksquare$


2 implies 1
Follows from:

Symmetric Bilinear Form is Reflexive
Alternating Bilinear Form is Reflexive
$\blacksquare$

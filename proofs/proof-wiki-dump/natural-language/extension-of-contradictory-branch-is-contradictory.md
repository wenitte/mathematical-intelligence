Theorem
Let $T$ be a propositional tableau.
Let $\Gamma$ be a contradictory branch of $T$.
Let $\Gamma'$ be an extension of $\Gamma$.

Then $\Gamma'$ is also contradictory.


Proof
Since $\Gamma$ is contradictory, there is some WFF $\mathbf A$ such that both $\mathbf A$ and $\neg \mathbf A$ occur along $\Gamma$.
Since $\Gamma'$ is an extension of $\Gamma$, $\mathbf A$ and $\neg \mathbf A$ also occur along $\Gamma'$.

Hence $\Gamma'$ is contradictory.
$\blacksquare$

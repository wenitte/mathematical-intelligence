Example of Use of Monotone Convergence Theorem (Real Analysis)
Let $x \in \R$ such that $0 < x < 1$.
The sequence $\sequence {a_n}_{n \mathop \ge 1}$ defined as:

$a_n = x^n$
is convergent to the limit $0$.


Proof
From Power of Real Number between Zero and One is Bounded, $\sequence {a_n}$ is bounded below with supremum $0$.
As $x < 1$, it follows from Real Number Ordering is Compatible with Multiplication that:

$x^{k + 1} < x^k$
The result follows from the Monotone Convergence Theorem (Real Analysis).

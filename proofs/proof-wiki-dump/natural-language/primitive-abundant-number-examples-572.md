Example of Primitive Abundant Number
$572$ is a primitive abundant number:

$1 + 2 + 4 + 11 + 13 + 22 + 26 + 44 + 52 + 143 + 286 = 604 > 572$


Proof
From $\sigma_1$ of $572$, we have:

$\map {\sigma_1} {572} - 572 = 604$
where $\sigma_1$ denotes the divisor sum function.
Thus, by definition, $572$ is an abundant number.

The aliquot parts of $572$ are enumerated at $\sigma_0$ of $572$:

$1, 2, 4, 11, 13, 22, 26, 44, 52, 143, 286$
By inspecting the divisor sums of each of these, they are seen to be deficient.
Hence the result, by definition of primitive abundant number.

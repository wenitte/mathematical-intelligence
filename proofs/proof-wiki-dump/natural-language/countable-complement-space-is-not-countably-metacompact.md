Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a countable complement topology on an uncountable set $S$.

Then $T$ is not countably metacompact.


Proof
From Uncountable Subset of Countable Complement Space Intersects Open Sets, the intersection of any open sets is uncountable.
So for any open cover $\CC$ of $T$, every point is in an infinite number of open sets of $T$.
So no refinement of any open cover of $T$ can be point finite.
Hence the result by definition of countably metacompact.
$\blacksquare$

Examples of Multiplicative Persistence
$39$ is the smallest positive integer which has a multiplicative persistence of $3$.


Proof
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 3 \times 9\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 27\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 2 \times 7\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 14\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 1 \times 4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4\)










The product of the $2$ digits of a positive integer smaller than $39$ is less than $25$, for example:














\(\ds 3 \times 8\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 24\)




















\(\ds 2 \times 9\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 18\)










From Multiplicative Persistence of 25, all such positive integers have a multiplicative persistence of $2$.
The result follows.

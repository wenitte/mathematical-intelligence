Theorem
Let $\On$ denote the class of all ordinals.
Let $g$ be the successor mapping:

$\forall x \in \On: \map g x = x \cup \set x$

Then $\On$ is a $g$-tower.


Proof
From Successor Mapping is Progressing, $g$ is a progressing mapping.
From Class of All Ordinals is Minimally Superinductive over Successor Mapping, $\On$ is superinductive over $g$.
Hence the result by definition of $g$-tower.
$\blacksquare$

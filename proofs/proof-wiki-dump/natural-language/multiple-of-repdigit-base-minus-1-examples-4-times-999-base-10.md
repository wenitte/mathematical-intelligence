Example of Multiple of Repdigit Base minus 1
$4 \times 999$ (base $10$) is equal to $3996$.


Proof
From Multiple of Repdigit Base minus 1:

the first digit of $4 \times 999$ is $4 - 1 = 3$
the last digit of $4 \times 999$ is $10 - 4 = 6$
there are $3 - 1 = 2$ instances of $9$ in between.
Hence:

$4 \times 999 = 3996$

Theorem
Let $\struct {\Z, +, \times}$ denote the ring of integers.
Let $J$ be a prime ideal of $\Z$.

Then either:

$J = \set 0$
or:

$J = \ideal p$
where:

$p$ is a prime number
$\ideal p$ denotes the principal ideal of $\Z$ generated by $p$.


Proof
From Prime Ideal iff Quotient Ring is Integral Domain:

$J$ is a prime ideal of $\Z$ if and only if $\Z / J$ is an integral domain.

From Quotient Ring of Integers and Zero:

$\Z / \set 0 \cong \Z$
As $\Z$ is an integral domain, it follows that $\set 0$ is a prime ideal of $\Z$.

From Quotient Ring of Integers with Principal Ideal:

$\struct {\Z, +, \times} / \ideal p$ is isomorphic to $\struct {\Z_p, +_p, \times_p}$, the ring of integers modulo $p$.
From Ring of Integers Modulo Prime is Integral Domain:

$\struct {\Z_n, +_n, \times_p}$ is an integral domain if and only if $p$ is prime.
The result follows.

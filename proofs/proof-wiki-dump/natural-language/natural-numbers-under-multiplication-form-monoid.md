Theorem
The set of natural numbers under multiplication $\struct {\N, \times}$ is a monoid.


Proof
Taking the monoid axioms in turn:


Monoid Axiom $\text S 0$: Closure
From Natural Number Multiplication is Closed, $\struct {\N, \times}$ is a closed algebraic structure.
$\Box$


Monoid Axiom $\text S 1$: Associativity
From Natural Number Multiplication is Associative, $\struct {\N, \times}$ is an associative algebraic structure.
$\Box$


Monoid Axiom $\text S 2$: Identity
From Identity Element of Natural Number Multiplication is One, $\struct {\N, \times}$ has an identity element $1$.
$\Box$

All the monoid axioms are thus seen to be fulfilled, and so $\struct {\N, \times}$ is a monoid.
$\blacksquare$

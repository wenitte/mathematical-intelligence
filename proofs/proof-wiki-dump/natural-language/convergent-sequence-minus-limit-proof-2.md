Theorem
Let $X$ be one of the standard number fields $\Q, \R, \C$.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a sequence in $X$ which converges to $l$.
That is:

$\ds \lim_{n \mathop \to \infty} x_n = l$

Then:

$\ds \lim_{n \mathop \to \infty} \cmod {x_n - l} = 0$


Proof
We note that all of $\Q, \R, \C$ can be considered as metric spaces.
Then under the usual metric:

$\map d {x_n, l} = \cmod {x_n - l}$.
The result follows from the definition of metric:

$\map d {x_n, l} = 0 \iff x_n = l$.

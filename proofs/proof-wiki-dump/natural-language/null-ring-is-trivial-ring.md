Theorem
Let $R$ be the null ring.

Then $R$ is a trivial ring.


Proof
We have that $R$ is the null ring.
That is, by definition it has a single element, which can be denoted $0_R$, such that:

$R := \struct {\set {0_R}, +, \circ}$
where ring addition and the ring product are defined as:














\(\ds 0_R + 0_R\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0_R\)




















\(\ds 0_R \circ 0_R\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0_R\)










Consider the operation $+$.
By definition, the algebraic structure $\struct {\set {0_R}, +}$ is a trivial group.

Then:

$\forall a, b \in R: a \circ b = 0_R$
Thus by definition, $R$ is a trivial ring.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $x \in \Q$.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be the sequence in $\Q$ defined as $x_n = x^n$.

Then:

$\size x < 1$ if and only if $\sequence {x_n}$ is a null sequence.


Proof
By the definition of convergence of a rational sequence:

$\sequence {x_n}$ is a null sequence in the rational numbers if and only if $\sequence {x_n}$ is a null sequence in the real numbers
By Sequence of Powers of Real Number less than One:

$\sequence {x_n}$ is a null sequence in the real numbers if and only if $\size x < 1$
$\blacksquare$

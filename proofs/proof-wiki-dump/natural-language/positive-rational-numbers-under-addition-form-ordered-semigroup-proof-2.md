Theorem
Let $\Q_{\ge 0}$ denote the set of positive rational numbers.
The algebraic structure:

$\struct {\Q_{\ge 0}, +, \le}$
forms an ordered semigroup.


Proof
From Rational Numbers form Totally Ordered Field, $\struct {\Q, +, \times, \le}$ is a totally ordered field.
Hence $\struct {\Q, +, \le}$ is an ordered group, and so an ordered semigroup.

From Positive Rational Numbers are Closed under Addition we have that $\struct {\Q_{\ge 0}, +}$ is closed.
Hence from Subsemigroup Closure Test, $\struct {\Q_{\ge 0}, +}$ is a subsemigroup of $\struct {\Q, +}$.
From Subsemigroup of Ordered Semigroup is Ordered, $\struct {\Q_{\ge 0}, +, \le}$ is an ordered semigroup.

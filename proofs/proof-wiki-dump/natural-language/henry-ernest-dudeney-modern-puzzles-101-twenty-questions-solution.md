Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $101$
Twenty Questions
I think of a number containing six figures.
Can you discover what it is by putting to me twenty questions,
each of which can only be answered by "yes" or "no"?
After the twentieth question you must give the number.


Solution
Successively ask:

Does the number divided by $2$ leave a remainder?
Does the quotient divided by $2$ leave a remainder?
Does that quotient divided by $2$ leave a remainder?
Each of the $20$ questions will be the same.
Write down a string from right to left of:

$1$ if the answer is yes
$0$ if the answer is no.
The number sought in binary form is what you have written down.
$\blacksquare$

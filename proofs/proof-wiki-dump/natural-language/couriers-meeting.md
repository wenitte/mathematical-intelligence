Classic Problem
The Holy Father sent a courier from Rome to Venice, commanding him that he reach Venice in $7$ days.
The Most Illustrious Signorina of Venice sent a courier from Venice to Rome, directing him to reach Rome in $9$ days.
It is $250$ miles between Rome and Venice.
It so happened that both couriers started at exactly the same time.
In how many days do they meet?


Solution
$3 \frac {15} {16}$ days.


Proof
Let $A$ and $B$ denote the couriers starting from Rome and Venice respectively.
Let $t$ be the time in days after they set out when they meet.
Let $x$ be the number of miles from Rome where that happens.
We have that:

$A$ travels at $\dfrac {250} 7$ miles a day
$B$ travels at $\dfrac {250} 9$ miles a day.
Thus we have:














\(\ds \dfrac {250} 7 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x\)




















\(\ds \dfrac {250} 9 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 250 - x\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 250 \paren {\dfrac 1 7 + \dfrac 1 9} t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x + \paren {250 - x}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 250 \paren {\dfrac {16} {63} } t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 250\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {63} {16}\)









Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

It remains to be demonstrated that it is the only such number.
Let $\sqbrk {abcdefghi}$ be a polydivisible number which is penholodigital.
By Divisibility by 5:

$e = 5$
By Divisibility by 2:

$b, d, f, h$ are even.
Hence:

$a, c, g, i$ are odd.
By Divisibility by 3:

$a + b + c$, $d + 5 + f$, $g + h + i$ are divisible by $3$.
By Divisibility by 8:

$\sqbrk {fgh}$ is divisible by $8$.
Because $f$ is even:

$\sqbrk {f00}$ is divisible by $8$.
We must therefore have:

$\sqbrk {gh}$ divisible by $8$.
Thus:

$\sqbrk {gh}$ must be one of $16, 32, 72, 96$.
Because $i$ is odd and $g + h + i$ are divisible by $3$:

$\sqbrk {ghi}$ must be one of $321, 327, 723, 729, 963$.
By Divisibility by 4:

$\sqbrk {cd}$ is divisible by $4$.
Because $c$ is odd:

$d$ must be $2$ or $6$.

Suppose $h = 6$.
Then $\sqbrk {ghi} = 963$ and $d = 2$.
Since $d + 5 + f$ is divisible by $3$ and $f$ is even:

$f = 8$
The remaining even number $b$ must be $4$.
So:

$\sqbrk {abcdefghi} = \sqbrk {a4c258963}$
Thus the only remaining options for $a$ and $c$ are $1$ and $7$.
However, we find that neither $1472589$ nor $7412689$ is divisible by $7$.

Therefore we must have:

$h = 2$
It follow therefore that:

$d = 6$
Because $d + 5 + f$ is divisible by $3$, and $f$ is even:

$f = 4$
The remaining even number $b$ must be $8$.
So:

$\sqbrk {abcdefghi} = \sqbrk {a8c654g2i}$
Since $a + 8 + c$ is divisible by $3$:

$\sqbrk {a8c}$ must be one of $183, 189, 381, 387, 783, 789, 981, 987$.

Suppose $g = 3$.
Then:

$\sqbrk {a8c}$ must be one of $189, 789, 981, 987$.
Inspection of the possible numbers reveals that none of $1896543$, $7896543$, $9816543$, $9876543$ is divisible by $7$.

Suppose $g = 7$.
Then:

$\sqbrk {a8c}$ must be one of $183, 189, 381, 981$.
Among $1836547$, $1896547$, $3816547$, $9816547$, only $3816547$ is divisible by $7$.
The results follow.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $p \implies q$ be a conditional.
Then the converse of $p \implies q$ is the contrapositive of its inverse.


Proof
The converse of $p \implies q$ is:

$q \implies p$
The inverse of $p \implies q$ is:

$\neg p \implies \neg q$
The contrapositive of $\neg p \implies \neg q$ is:

$\neg \neg q \implies \neg \neg p$
By Double Negation, the two are seen to be equal.
$\blacksquare$

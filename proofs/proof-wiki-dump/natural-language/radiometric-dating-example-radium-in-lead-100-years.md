Example of Radiometric Dating
Let $Q$ be a sample of lead.
It is established that the half-life of radium-226 is $1600$ years.
So, after $100$ years, the amount of radium-226 that has decayed will be $4.2 \%$.


Proof
From First-Order Reaction, we have:

$x = x_0 e^{-k t}$
where:

$x$ is the quantity of radium at time $t$
$x_0$ is the quantity of radium at time $t = 0$
$k$ is a positive number.

By definition of half-life, when $x = \dfrac {x_0} 2$, we have $t = 1600$.
So:

$e^{-1600 k} = \dfrac 1 2$
So:

$k = \dfrac {\ln 0.5} {-1600} = \dfrac {\ln 2} {1600}$

After $100$ years:














\(\ds \dfrac x {x_0}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^{100 \paren {\ln 2 / 1600} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^{\ln 2 / 16}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0.9576\)










So there is $95.76\%$ remaining, and so $4.2\%$ will be lost.
$\blacksquare$

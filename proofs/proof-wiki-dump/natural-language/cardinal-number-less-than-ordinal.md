Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\card S$ denote the cardinal number of $S$.
Let $x$ be an ordinal such that $S \sim x$.

Then:

$\card S \le x$


Corollary
Let $x$ be an ordinal.
Let $\card x$ denote the cardinal number of $x$.

Then:

$\card x \le x$


Proof
Since $S \sim x$, it follows that:

$x \in \set {y \in \On : S \sim y}$
By Intersection is Subset: General Result, it follows that:

$\ds \bigcap \set {y \in \On: S \sim y} \subseteq x$

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Link to the fact that $\le$ is isomorphic to $\subseteq$ on ordinals.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.

Therefore $\card S \le x$ by the definition of cardinal number.
$\blacksquare$

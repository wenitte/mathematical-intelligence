Example of Use of Equation for Line through Two Points in Complex Plane
Let $L$ be a straight line through $2 + i$ and $3 - 2 i$ in the complex plane.
Then $L$ can be expressed by the equations:

$x = 2 + t, y = 1 - 3 t$


Proof
From Equation for Line through Two Points in Complex Plane: Parametric Form $2$, a straight line $L$ passing through $2$ points $z_1 = x_1 + i y_1$ and $z_2 = x_2 + i y_2$ has the equations:














\(\ds x - x_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t \paren {x_2 - x_1}\)




















\(\ds y - y_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t \paren {y_2 - y_1}\)










Hence:














\(\ds x - 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t \paren {3 - 2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 + t\)
























\(\ds y - 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds t \paren {-2 - 1}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1 - 3 t\)

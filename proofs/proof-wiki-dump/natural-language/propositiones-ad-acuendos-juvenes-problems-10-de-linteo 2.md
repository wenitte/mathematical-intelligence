Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $10$
De Linteo
A Linen Problem
I have a piece of linen, $60$ cubits long and $40$ cubits wide.
I want to cut it into portions, each of which will be $6$ cubits long and $4$ wide.
How many portions can be made of it?


Solution
$100$.


Proof
We have that:

$6$ goes into $60$ a total of $10$ times
$4$ goes into $40$ also a total of $10$ times.
Thus the cloth can be cut into $10 \times 10 = 100$ pieces that are $6$ cubits long and $4$ cubits wide.
$\blacksquare$

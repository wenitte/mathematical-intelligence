Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be an algebraic structure.
Let $\struct {T, *}$ be a group.
Let $\phi: \struct {S, \circ} \to \struct {T, *}$ be a homomorphism.
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ have an identity $e_S$.
Let $x^{-1}$ be an inverse of $x$ for $\circ$.

Then $\map \phi {x^{-1} }$ is an inverse of $\map \phi x$ for $*$.


Proof
By hypothesis, $\struct {T, *}$ is a group.
By Group Axiom $\text G 2$: Existence of Identity Element, $\struct {T, *}$ has an identity.
Thus Homomorphism with Identity Preserves Inverses can be applied.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\N$ be the natural numbers.
Let $\times$ be multiplication.
Let $\le$ be the ordering on $\N$.

Then $\struct {\N, \times, \le}$ is an ordered commutative semigroup.


Proof
By Natural Numbers under Multiplication form Semigroup, $\struct {\N, \times, \le}$ is a semigroup.
By Natural Number Multiplication is Commutative, $\times$ is commutative.
By Ordering on Natural Numbers is Compatible with Multiplication, $\le$ is compatible with $\times$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

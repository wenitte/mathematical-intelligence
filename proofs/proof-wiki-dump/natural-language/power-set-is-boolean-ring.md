Theorem
Let $S$ be a set, and let $\powerset S$ be its power set.
Denote with $\symdif$ and $\cap$ symmetric difference and intersection, respectively.

Then $\struct {S, \symdif, \cap}$ is a Boolean ring.


Proof
From Symmetric Difference with Intersection forms Ring, $\struct {S, \symdif, \cap}$ is a ring with unity.
By Set Intersection is Idempotent, $\cap$ is idempotent.

It follows that $\struct {S, \symdif, \cap}$ is a Boolean ring.
$\blacksquare$

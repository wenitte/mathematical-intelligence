Theorem
Let $x$ be an irrational number.
Let $\sequence {C_n}$ be the sequence of convergents of the continued fraction expansion of $x$.

Then $\forall n \ge 1$:

$C_n < x < C_{n + 1}$ or $C_{n + 1} < x < C_n$
$\size {x - C_n} < \dfrac 1 {q_n q_{n + 1} }$

The validity of the material on this page is questionable.In particular: this needs Correspondence between Irrational Numbers and Simple Infinite Continued FractionsYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by resolving the issues.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Questionable}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Immediate.
Note that:

$\size {x - C_n} < \size {C_{n + 1} - C_n} = \dfrac 1 {q_n q_{n + 1} }$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T$ be a topological space.
Let $T' \subseteq T$ be a subspace of $T$.
Let subspace $T'$ be closed in $T$.
Then $V \subseteq T'$ is closed in $T'$ if and only if $V$ is closed in $T$.


Proof
Let $V \subseteq T'$ be closed in $T'$.
Then, from Closed Set in Topological Subspace, $V = T' \cap V$ is closed in $T'$.
If $V$ is closed in $T'$ then $V = T' \cap W$ where $W$ is closed in $T$.
Since $T'$ is closed in $T$, it follows by Topology Defined by Closed Sets that $V$ is closed in $T$.

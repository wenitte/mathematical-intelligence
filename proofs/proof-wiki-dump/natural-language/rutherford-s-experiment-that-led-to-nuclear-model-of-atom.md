Physics Experiment
When swiftly-moving $\alpha$ particles are directed at gold atoms, sometimes they are deflected as much as $180 \degrees$.
It is deduced that the atoms consist of a heavy central nucleus surrounded by a lot of what appears to be empty space.


Strength of Force
The $\alpha$ particles that were deflected through $180 \degrees$ were coming within $10^{-14} \ \mathrm m$ of the nucleus.
The electric charge on the $\alpha$ particle is $2 \E$, where $\E$ is the elementary charge.
The electric charge on the nucleus of gold is $79 \E$.
Hence by Coulomb's Law of Electrostatics, the force $F$ on the $\alpha$ particle at this range is given by:














\(\ds F\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2 \times 79 \times \E^2} {4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \paren {2 \times 10^{-14} }^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\approx\)







\(\ds 90 \ \mathrm N\)









given the values:

$\E = 1.60217 \, 6634 \times 10^{−19} \ \mathrm C$
$\varepsilon_0 = 8 \cdotp 85418 \, 78128 (13) \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm F \, \mathrm m^{-1}$
Hence we have a force acting within a single atom of the weight of nearly $10 \mathrm {kg}$.

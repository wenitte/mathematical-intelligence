Theorem
Let $a, b, c, d$ be integers.
Let: 

$a \perp c, b \perp c, a \perp d, b \perp d$
where $a \perp c$ denotes that $a$ and $c$ are coprime.
Then:

$a b \perp c d$

In the words of Euclid:

If two numbers be prime to two numbers, both to each, their products also will be prime to one another.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VII}$: Proposition $26$)

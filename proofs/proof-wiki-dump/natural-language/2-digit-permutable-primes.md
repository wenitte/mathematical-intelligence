Theorem
The $2$-digit permutable primes are:

$11, 13, 17, 37, 79$
and their anagrams, and no other.


Proof
It is confirmed that:

$13$ and $31$ are both prime
$17$ and $71$ are both prime
$37$ and $73$ are both prime.
$79$ and $97$ are both prime.

From Digits of Permutable Prime, all permutable primes contain digits in the set:

$\left\{ {1, 3, 7, 9}\right\}$

By Prime Repdigit Number is Repunit, all $2$-digit repdigit numbers are composite except for $11$ which is prime.
From Repunit Prime is Permutable Prime, it follows that $11$ is a permutable prime.

Apart from $11$ whose status is known, the possibly permutable primes are:

$13, 17, 19, 37, 39, 79$
and their anagrams.
We eliminate $13, 17, 37, 79$ from this list, as it has been established that they are permutable primes.

Of those remaining, the following is composite:














\(\ds 39\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 13\)










It remains to demonstrate that the anagram of $19$, that is, $91$, composite.
We find that:














\(\ds 91\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \times 13\)









All contenders are eliminated except for the established permutable primes $11, 13, 17, 37, 79$ and their anagrams.

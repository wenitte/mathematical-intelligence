Theorem
Let $a, b \in \R$, such that:

$\forall \epsilon \in \R_{>0}: a < b + \epsilon$
where $\R_{>0}$ is the set of strictly positive real numbers.
That is:

$\epsilon > 0$

Then:

$a \le b$


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $a > b$.
Then:

$a - b > 0$
By hypothesis, we have:

$\forall \epsilon \in \R_{>0}: a < b + \epsilon$
Let $\epsilon = a - b$.
Then:

$a < b + \paren {a - b} \implies a < a$
The result follows by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

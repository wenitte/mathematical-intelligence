Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $148$
A Menagerie
A travelling menagerie contained two freaks of nature --  a four-footed bird and a six-footed calf.
An attendant was asked how many birds and beasts there were in the show, and he said:
"Well, there are $36$ heads and $100$ feet altogether.
You can work it out for yourself."


Solution
There are $12$ beasts and $24$ birds.


Proof
Let $a$ and $b$ be the number of beasts and birds respectively.
If the anomalies had the usual number of legs, there would be $96$ feet altogether.
Hence we have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds a + b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 36\)





as they each have one head




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 4 a + 2 b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 96\)





as (normal) beasts have $4$ legs and birds $2$




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 a + 2 b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 72\)





$(1) \times 2$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 24\)





$(2) - (3)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 24\)

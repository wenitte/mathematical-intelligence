Theorem
The set of complex numbers under addition $\left({\C, +}\right)$ forms a monoid.


Proof
Taking the monoid axioms in turn:


Monoid Axiom $\text S 0$: Closure
Complex Addition is Closed.
$\Box$


Monoid Axiom $\text S 1$: Associativity
Complex Addition is Associative.
$\Box$


Monoid Axiom $\text S 2$: Identity
From Complex Addition Identity is Zero, we have that the identity element of $\struct {\C, +}$ is the complex number $0 + 0 i$:

$\paren {x + i y} + \paren {0 + 0 i} = \paren {x + 0} + i \paren {y + 0} = x + i y$
and similarly for $\paren {0 + 0 i} + \paren {x + i y}$.
$\Box$

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

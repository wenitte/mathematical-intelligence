Theorem
Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group on $n$ letters.
Let $e \in S_n$ be the identity permutation on $S_n$.

Then $e$ is an even permutation on $S_n$.


Proof
By definition of the identity permutation:

$\forall i \in \N_{>0}: \map e i = i$
Thus $e$ fixes all elements of $S_n$.
We have that a Transposition is of Odd Parity.
Hence a permutation is odd if and only if if is the composition of an odd number of transpositions.
The identity permutation is the composition of $0$ (zero) transpositions.
Hence the result.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a particular point space.

Then $T$ is a $T_0$ (Kolmogorov) space.


Proof
We have:

Particular Point Topology is Closed Extension Topology of Discrete Topology
Discrete Space satisfies all Separation Properties (including being a $T_0$ space)

Then by Condition for Closed Extension Space to be $T_0$ Space, as a discrete space is $T_0$ then so is its closed extension.
$\blacksquare$

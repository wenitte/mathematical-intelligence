Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \set {\O, S} }$ be an indiscrete topological space.
Let $H \subseteq S$.

$H$ is a $G_\delta$ ($G$-delta) set of $T$ if and only if either $H = S$ or $H = \O$.


Proof
A $G_\delta$ set is a set which can be written as a countable intersection of open sets of $S$.
Hence the only $G_\delta$ sets of $T$ are made from intersections of $T$ and $\O$.
So $T$ and $\O$ are the only $G_\delta$ sets of $T$.
$\blacksquare$

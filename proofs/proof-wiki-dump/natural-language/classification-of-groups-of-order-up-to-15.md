Theorem
Up to isomorphism, every group of order $\order G \le 15$ is one of the below:




Order
Abelian
Non-Abelian


1
$\Z_1$



2
$\Z_2$



3
$\Z_3$



4
$\Z_4, \Z_2 \oplus \Z_2$



5
$\Z_5$



6
$\Z_6$
$D_3 \cong S_3$


7
$\Z_7$



8
$\Z_8, \Z_4 \oplus \Z_2, \Z_2 \oplus \Z_2 \oplus \Z_2$
$D_4, \Dic 2$


9
$\Z_9, \Z_3 \oplus \Z_3$



10
$\Z_{10}$
$D_5$


11
$\Z_{11}$



12
$\Z_{12}, \Z_6 \oplus \Z_2$
$D_6, A_4, \Dic 3$


13
$\Z_{13}$



14
$\Z_{14}$
$D_7$


15
$\Z_{15}$


where:

$D_n$ is the dihedral group of order $2 n$
$S_n$ is the $n$th symmetric group
$A_n$ is the alternating group on $n$ points
$\Dic n$ is the dicyclic group of order $4 n$.


Proof
The Abelian cases are the direct result of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.
The non-Abelian cases follow from seven separate theorems:

$(1): \quad$ Trivial Group is Cyclic Group - determines theorem for order $1$
$(2): \quad$ Prime Group is Cyclic - determines theorem for orders $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $11$, and $13$
$(3): \quad$ Group of Order Prime Squared is Abelian - determines theorem for orders $4$ and $9$
$(4): \quad$ Group of Order p q is Cyclic - determines theorem for order $15$
$(5): \quad$ Groups of Order Twice a Prime - determines theorem for orders $6$, $10$, $14$
$(6): \quad$ Groups of Order 8 - determines theorem for order $8$
$(7): \quad$ Groups of Order 12 - determines theorem for order $12$
$\blacksquare$

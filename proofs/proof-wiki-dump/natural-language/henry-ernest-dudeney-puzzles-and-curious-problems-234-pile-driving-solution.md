Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $234$
Pile Driving
During some bridge-building operations a pile was being driven into the bed of the river.
A foreman remarked that at high water a quarter of the pile was embedded in the mud,
one-third was under water,
and $17$ feet $6$ inches above water.
What was the length of the pile?


Solution
$26$ feet $3$ inches.


Proof
Let $L$ feet be the length of the pile.

You may be tempted to do this:














\(\ds L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac L 4 + \dfrac L 3 + 17 \tfrac 1 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 12 L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 L + 4 L + 12 \times 17 \tfrac 1 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 210\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 42\)










No no no!
The part of the pile buried in the mud is also under water.
So:














\(\ds L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac L 3 + 17 \tfrac 1 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 3 L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds L + 3 \times 17 \tfrac 1 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 52 \tfrac 1 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 26 \tfrac 1 4\)









and it is seen that the proportion of the pile which is buried in mud is no more than a distraction.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $L = \struct{S, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a distributive lattice with greatest element $\top$ and smallest element $\bot$.
Let $\eqslantless$ denote the well inside relation on $L$.

Then:

$\forall a \in S : a \eqslantless a \iff a$ has a complement


Proof
Follows immediately from:

Definition:Well Inside Relation
Definition:Complement (Lattice Theory)
$\blacksquare$

Corollary to Linear Transformation is Injective iff Kernel Contains Only Zero
Let $\mathbf A$ be in the matrix space $\map {\mathbf M_{m, n} } \R$
Then the mapping: 

$\R^n \to \R^m: \mathbf x \mapsto \mathbf {A x}$
is injective if and only if:

$\map {\mathrm N} {\mathbf A} = \set {\mathbf 0}$
where $\map {\mathrm N} {\mathbf A}$ is the null space of $\mathbf A$.


Proof
From Matrix Product as Linear Transformation, $\mathbf x \mapsto \mathbf {A x}$ defines a linear transformation.
The result follows from Linear Transformation is Injective iff Kernel Contains Only Zero and the definition of null space.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S \times T, \circ}$ be the external direct product of the two algebraic structures $\struct {S, \circ_1}$ and $\struct {T, \circ_2}$.
Let $\circ_1$ and $\circ_2$ be commutative operations.

Then $\circ$ is also a commutative operation.


General Result
Let $\ds \struct {S, \circ} = \prod_{k \mathop = 1}^n S_k$ be the external direct product of the algebraic structures $\struct {S_1, \circ_1}, \struct {S_2, \circ_2}, \ldots, \struct {S_n, \circ_n}$.

If $\circ_1, \ldots, \circ_n$ are all commutative, then so is $\circ$.


Proof
Let $\circ_1$ and $\circ_2$ be commutative operations.














\(\ds \tuple {s_1, t_1} \circ \tuple {s_2, t_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {s_1 \circ_1 s_2, t_1 \circ_2 t_2}\)





Definition of Operation Induced by Direct Product














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {s_2 \circ_1 s_1, t_2 \circ_2 t_1}\)





Definition of Commutative Operation














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {s_2, t_2} \circ \tuple {s_1, t_1}\)





Definition of Operation Induced by Direct Product



Thus $\circ$ is commutative.

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $243$
The Squirrel's Climb
A squirrel goes spirally up a cylindrical post, making the circuit in $4$ feet.
How many feet does it travel to the top if the post is $16$ feet high and $3$ feet in circumference?


Solution
$20$ feet.


Proof
In going $3$ feet around, the squirrel goes $4$ feet up.
These are the sides of the classic $3$-$4$-$5$ triangle.
Hence in going up $4$ feet, the squirrel travels $5$ feet.
Hence in going $16 = 4 \times 4$ feet, the squirrel travels $4 \times 5 = 20$ feet.
$\blacksquare$

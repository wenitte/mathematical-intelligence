Theorem
Let $n \in \Z$ be an integer such that $n \ge 3$.
Let $C_n$ denote the cycle graph of order $n$.
Then $C_n$ is Hamiltonian.


Proof
Recall the definition of a Hamiltonian graph:

$G$ is Hamiltonian if and only if it is an undirected graph that contains a cycle that contains every vertex of $G$ (but not necessarily every edge of $G$).
A cycle graph is a graph which consists of a single cycle.
So all the vertices of $C_n$ are on the same cycle.
The result follows.

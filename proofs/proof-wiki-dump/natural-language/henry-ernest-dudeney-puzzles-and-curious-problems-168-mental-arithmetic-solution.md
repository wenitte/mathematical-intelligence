Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $168$
Mental Arithmetic
Find two whole numbers (each less than $10$)
such that the sum of their squares, added to their product, will make a square.


Solution
Dudeney gives $3$ and $5$:

$3^2 + 3 \times 5 + 5^2 = 49 = 7^2$
but we also have:

$7^2 + 7 \times 8 + 8^2 = 169 = 13^2$


Proof
Let $a$ and $b$ be the numbers in question.
We have that:














\(\ds a^2 + a b + b^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a - m b}^2\)





for some $m$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2 - 2 a m b + b^2 m^2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b + a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -2 a m + b m^2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {a \paren {2 m + 1} } {m^2 - 1}\)









$m$ can be any integer greater than $1$, and $a$ is chosen to make $b$ an integer.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Explain why the general values below are what they are based on the general rule just derived.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
The general values are:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m^2 - 1\)




















\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 m + 1\)










Setting $m = 2$, we have:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2^2 - 1\)

\(\ds = 3\)


















\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times 2 + 1\)

\(\ds = 5\)








Setting $m = 3$, we have:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3^2 - 1\)

\(\ds = 8\)


















\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times 3 + 1\)

\(\ds = 7\)







and the two solutions are apparent.

Theorem
Let $\struct {\Q, \tau_d}$ be the rational number space under the Euclidean topology $\tau_d$.
Let $p$ be a new element not in $\Q$.
Let $\Q^* := \Q \cup \set p$.
Let $T^* = \struct {\Q^*, \tau^*}$ be the Alexandroff extension on $\left({\Q, \tau_d}\right)$.

Then $p$ is a dispersion point of $T^*$.


Proof
By definition, $p$ is a dispersion point of $T^*$ if and only if:

$\Q^*$ is a connected set in $T^*$
$\Q^* \setminus \set p$ is totally disconnected in $T^*$.
From Alexandroff Extension of Rational Number Space is Connected, $\Q^*$ is a connected set in $T^*$.
It remains to be shown that $\Q^* \setminus \set p$ is totally disconnected in $T^*$.
By definition, $\Q^* \setminus \set p$ is the rational number space $\struct {\Q, \tau_d}$.
The result follows from Rational Numbers are Totally Disconnected.
$\blacksquare$

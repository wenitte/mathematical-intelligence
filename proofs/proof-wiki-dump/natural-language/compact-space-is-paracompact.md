Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a compact space.
Then $T$ is paracompact.


Proof
From the definition, $T$ is compact if and only if every open cover of $S$ has a finite subcover.
From Subcover is Refinement of Cover, it follows that every open cover of $S$ has an open refinement which is locally finite.

This is precisely the definition of paracompact.
$\blacksquare$

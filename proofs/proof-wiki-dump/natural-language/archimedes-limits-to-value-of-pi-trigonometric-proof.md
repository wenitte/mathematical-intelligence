Theorem
The value of $\pi$ lies between $3 \frac {10} {71}$ and $3 \frac 1 7$:

$3 \dfrac {10} {71} < \pi < 3 \dfrac 1 7$


Proof
Let $O$ be a circle with diameter $AB = 1$
Let $Q$ be the circumference of $O$.
By the definition of $\pi$:

$\dfrac Q {AB} = \pi$
Since $AB = 1$ then $Q$ is exactly $\pi$.

Using regular polygons inscribed and circumscribed about the circle $O$, we aim to demonstrate that the bounds on $\pi$ are:

$\dfrac {223} {71} < \pi < \dfrac {22} {7}$


Lemma 1
$\ds \cot \dfrac \phi 2 = \cot \phi + \csc \phi$


Lemma 2
Let:

$\cot \phi = \dfrac p q$
Then:

$\csc \phi = \dfrac 1 q \cdot \sqrt {p^2 + q^2}$


Lemma 3
$\pi < \dfrac {22} 7$


Lemma 4
$\pi > \dfrac {223} {71}$

Combining the two results from the fifth iteration of Lemma $3$ and Lemma $4$, we have:














\(\ds 3 \tfrac {10} {71}\)

\(<\)

\(\, \ds \pi \, \)

\(\, \ds < \, \)



\(\ds 3 \tfrac 1 7\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {223} {71}\)

\(<\)

\(\, \ds \pi \, \)

\(\, \ds < \, \)



\(\ds \dfrac {22} 7\)









Expressing this in decimal:

$3.1408 < \pi < 3.1429$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
Archimedes demonstrated the limits to the value of $\pi$ in his Measurement of a Circle. 
He does not say where the two estimates $\dfrac {265} {153}$ and $\dfrac {1351} {780}$ for $\sqrt 3$ come from.
They can be easily derived from the continued fraction representation, namely, $\sqbrk {1, \sequence {1, 2} }$, but whether he knew this, or had another method, is unclear.

Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If from a medial straight line there be subtracted a medial straight line commensurable with the whole in square only, and which contains with the whole a rational rectangle, the remainder is irrational. And let it be called a first apotome of a medial straight line.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $74$)


Proof

Let $AB$ be a medial straight line.
Let a medial straight line $BC$ such that:

$BC$ is commensurable in square only with $AB$
the rectangle contained by $AB$ and $BC$ is rational
be cut off from $AB$.
We have that $AB$ and $BC$ are medial.
So by definition $AB^2$ and $BC^2$ are both medial.
But $2 \cdot AB \cdot BC$ is rational.
Therefore:

$AB^2$ and $BC^2$ are incommensurable with $2 \cdot AB \cdot BC$.
From Proposition $16$ of Book $\text{X} $: Incommensurability of Sum of Incommensurable Magnitudes:

if $AB$ is incommensurable with either $AC$ or $CB$, $AC$ and $CB$ are incommensurable with each other.
Therefore by Proposition $7$ of Book $\text{II} $: Square of Difference:

$2 \cdot AB \cdot BC$ is incommensurable with $AC^2$.
Therefore $AC^2$ is irrational.
Therefore by definition $AC$ is irrational.

Such a straight line is known as a first apotome of a medial.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $74$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Theorem
The sequence of $16$ consecutive prime numbers beginning from $207 \, 622 \, 273$ are all of the form $4 n + 1$.


Proof



\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 273\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 568 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 482$nd prime




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 297\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 574 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 483$rd prime




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 301\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 575 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 484$th prime




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 313\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 578 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 485$th prime




\(\text {(5)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 321\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 580 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 486$th prime




\(\text {(6)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 381\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 595 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 487$th prime




\(\text {(7)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 409\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 602 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 488$th prime




\(\text {(8)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 417\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 604 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 489$th prime




\(\text {(9)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 421\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 605 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 490$th prime




\(\text {(10)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 489\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 622 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 491$st prime




\(\text {(11)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 501\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 625 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 492$nd prime




\(\text {(12)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 517\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 629 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 493$rd prime




\(\text {(13)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 537\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 634 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 494$th prime




\(\text {(14)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 549\)

\(=\)

\(\text {(15)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 553\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 638 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 496$th prime




\(\text {(16)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 207 \, 622 \, 561\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 640 + 1\)





and is the $11 \, 477 \, 497$th prime




Note that the $11 \, 477 \, 481$st prime:

$207 \, 622 \, 271 = 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 568 - 1$
and the $11 \, 477 \, 498$th prime:

$207 \, 622 \, 567 = 4 \times 51 \, 905 \, 642 - 1$
and so are not of the form $4 n + 1$.

Theorem
Let $\phi$ be a wave which is propagated along the $x$-axis in the negative direction with constant velocity $c$ and without change of shape.
Let $\paren {\map \phi x}_{t \mathop = 0} = \map f x$ be the wave profile of $\phi$.

Then the disturbance of $\phi$ at point $x$ and time $t$ can be expressed using the equation:

$\map \phi {x, t} = \map f {x + c t}$
where:

$x$ denotes the displacement from the origin along the $x$-axis
$t$ denotes the time.


Proof
We have by hypothesis that the velocity of $\phi$ in the negative direction is $c$.
Hence the velocity of $\phi$ in the positive direction is $-c$.
By Equation of Wave with Constant Velocity:

$\phi = \map f {x - \paren {-c} t}$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

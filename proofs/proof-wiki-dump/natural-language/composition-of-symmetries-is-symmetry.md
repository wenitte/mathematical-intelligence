Theorem
Let $P$ be a geometric figure.
Let $S_P$ be the set of all symmetries of $P$.
Let $\circ$ denote composition of mappings.
Let $\phi$ and $\psi$ be symmetries of $P$.

Then $\phi \circ \psi$ is also a symmetry of $P$.


Proof
By definition of composition of mappings:

$\phi \circ \psi$ is a mapping.

We have by definition of symmetry that:

$\map \phi P$ is congruent to $P$
and:

$\map \psi {\map \phi P}$ is congruent to $\map \phi P$
Therefore:

$\phi \circ \psi$ is congruent to $P$
Thus $\phi \circ \psi$ is a symmetry of $P$.
$\blacksquare$

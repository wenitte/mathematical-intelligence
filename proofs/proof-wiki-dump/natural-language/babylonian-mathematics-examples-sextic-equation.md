Example of Babylonian Mathematics
Simpify the system of simultaneous equations:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds x y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \dfrac {b x^2} y + \dfrac {c y^2} x + d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)











Solution
$x^3 = \dfrac a {2 b} \paren {-d \pm \sqrt {d^2 - 4 a b c} }$


Proof













\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac a x\)





from $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b x^2 \dfrac x a + \dfrac {a^2} {x^2} \dfrac c x + d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





substituting for $y$ in $(2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {b x^3} a + \dfrac {a^2 c} {x^3} + d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





tidying up








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b x^6 + a d x^3 + a^3 c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





multiplying through by $a x^3$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac a {2 b} \paren {-d \pm \sqrt {d^2 - 4 a b c} }\)





simplifying



$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
David Wells reports in his Curious and Interesting Puzzles of $1992$ that this example (once translated into the modern notation as presented here) comes from a Babylonian clay tablet dating from about $1600$ BCE.
He gives no further details.

Theorem
Let $K$ be a topological field.
Let $X$ be a topological vector space over $K$. 
Let $a, b \in X$.
Let $W$ be an open neighborhood of $a + b$.

Then there exists an open neighborhood $W_1$ of $a$ and an open neighborhood $W_2$ of $b$ such that: 

$W_1 + W_2 \subseteq W$
where $W_1 + W_2$ denotes the sum of $W_1$ and $W_2$.


Corollary 1
Let $W$ be an open neighborhood of ${\mathbf 0}_X$. 

Then there exists a symmetric open neighborhood $U$ of ${\mathbf 0}_X$ such that: 

$U + U \subseteq W$


Corollary 2
Let $K \in \set {\R, \C}$.
Let $W$ be an open neighborhood of ${\mathbf 0}_X$. 

Then there exists a balanced open neighborhood $U$ of ${\mathbf 0}_X$ such that: 

$U + U \subseteq W$


Proof
Equip $X \times X$ with the product topology.
From Box Topology on Finite Product Space is Product Topology, this is precisely the box topology.
Define $SÂ : X \times X \to X$ by: 

$\map S {x, y} = x + y$
for each $\tuple {x, y} \in X \times X$. 
From the definition of a topological vector space, $S$ is continuous.
In particular, $S$ is continuous at $\tuple {a, b}$.
Hence, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $\tuple {a, b}$ such that: 

$S \sqbrk V \subseteq W$
From Basis for Box Topology and the definition of a topology generated by a synthetic basis, there exists an open neighborhood $W_1$ of $a$ and an open neighborhood $W_2$ of $b$ such that:

$W_1 \times W_2 \subseteq V$
Then we have, from Image of Subset under Mapping is Subset of Image: 

$S \sqbrk {W_1 \times W_2} \subseteq S \sqbrk V$
Since: 

$S \sqbrk {W_1 \times W_2} = W_1 + W_2$
this gives: 

$W_1 + W_2 \subseteq W$
as required.

Theorem
Let $n \in \N \cup \set \infty$ be an extended natural number.
Let $\tuple {a_0, a_1, \ldots}$ be a simple continued fraction in $\R$ of length $n$.
Let $q_0, q_1, q_2, \ldots$ be its denominators.

Then for $0 \leq k \leq n$ we have $q_k > 0$.


Proof
Follows from:

$q_0 = 1$ by definition
Denominators of Simple Continued Fraction are Strictly Increasing.

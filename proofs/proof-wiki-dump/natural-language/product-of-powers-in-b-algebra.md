This page has been identified as a candidate for refactoring of basic complexity.In particular: The suggestion is that the two separate results be made as transclusions to this one.Until this has been finished, please leave {{Refactor}} in the code.
New contributors: Refactoring is a task which is expected to be undertaken by experienced editors only.

Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.
Theorem
Let $\struct {X, \circ}$ be a $B$-algebra.
Let $x \in X$ and $m, n \in \N$.

Then:

$x^m \circ x^n = \begin {cases}
x^{m - n} & : m \ge n \\
0 \circ x^{n - m} & : n > m
\end {cases}$


Proof
For $m \ge n$ the result follows from $B$-Algebra Power Law.
For $n > m$ the result follows from $B$-Algebra Power Law with Zero.
$\blacksquare$

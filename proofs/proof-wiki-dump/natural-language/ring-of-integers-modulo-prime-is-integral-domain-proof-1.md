Corollary to Ring of Integers Modulo Prime is Field
Let $m \in \Z: m \ge 2$.
Let $\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$â€Ž be the ring of integers modulo $m$.

Then:

$m$ is prime
if and only if:

$\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$ is an integral domain.


Proof
We have that a Field is Integral Domain.
We also have that a Finite Integral Domain is Galois Field.
The result follows from Ring of Integers Modulo Prime is Field.

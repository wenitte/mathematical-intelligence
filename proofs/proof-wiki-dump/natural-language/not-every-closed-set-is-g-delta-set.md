Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $V$ be a closed set of $T$.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $V$ is a $G_\delta$ set of $T$.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a finite complement topology on an uncountable set $S$.
Let $V$ be a closed set of $T$.
From Closed Set of Uncountable Finite Complement Topology is not $G_\delta$:

$V$ is not a $G_\delta$ set of $T$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

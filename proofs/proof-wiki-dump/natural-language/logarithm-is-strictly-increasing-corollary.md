Corollary to Logarithm is Strictly Increasing
Let $\ln$ be the natural logarithm.

Then $\ln$ is injective on $\R_{>0}$.


Proof
From Logarithm is Strictly Increasing, $\ln$ is strictly increasing on $\R_{> 0}$.
From Ordering on Real Numbers is Total Ordering, $\struct {\R_{> 0}, \le}$ is totally ordered.
From Strictly Monotone Mapping with Totally Ordered Domain is Injective, $\ln$ is injective.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct{X, \tau}$ be a topological space.

If every open cover of $T$ has an open $\sigma$-discrete refinement then:

every open cover of $T$ has an open $\sigma$-locally finite refinement
Proof
Follows immediately from Sigma-Discrete Set of Subsets is Sigma-Locally Finite.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $u$ be a differentiable real function of $x$.
Then:

$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\coth^{-1} u} = \dfrac {-1} {u^2 - 1} \dfrac {\d u} {\d x}$
where $\size u > 1$
where $\coth^{-1}$ is the inverse hyperbolic cotangent.


Proof













\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {\coth^{-1} u}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d u} } {\coth^{-1} u} \frac {\d u} {\d x}\)





Chain Rule for Derivatives














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {-1} {u^2 - 1} \frac {\d u} {\d x}\)

Can also be seen (and in fact most often seen) presented in the form:

$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\coth^{-1} u} = \dfrac 1 {1 - u^2} \dfrac {\d u} {\d x}$
but this obscures the fact that $\size u > 1$.
The condition is also often seen presented as $u^2 > 1$

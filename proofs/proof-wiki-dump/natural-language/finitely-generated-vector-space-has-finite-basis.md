Theorem
Let $K$ be a division ring.
Let $V$ be a finitely generated vector space over $K$.

Then $V$ has a finite basis.


Proof
This follows from Vector Space has Basis Between Linearly Independent Set and Finite Spanning Set.
It suffices to find:

A linearly independent subset $L\subset V$
A finite generator $S\subset V$
with $L\subset S$.
By Empty Set is Linearly Independent, we make take $L = \O$ and $S$ any finite generator, which exists because $V$ is finitely generated.
$\blacksquare$

Vector Space has Basis, which does not assume that $V$ is finitely generated

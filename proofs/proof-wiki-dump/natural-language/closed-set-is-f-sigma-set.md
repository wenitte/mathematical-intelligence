Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $V$ be a closed set of $T$.

Then $V$ is an $F_\sigma$ set of $T$.


Proof
$V$ is the union of a singleton.
So $V$ is trivially the union of a countable number of closed sets of $T$.
The result follows by definition of $F_\sigma$ set.
$\blacksquare$

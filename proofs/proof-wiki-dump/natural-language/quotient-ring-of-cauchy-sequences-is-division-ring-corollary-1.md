Theorem
Let $\struct {F, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a valued field.
Let $\CC$ be the ring of Cauchy sequences over $F$.
Let $\NN$ be the set of null sequences.
Then the quotient ring $\CC \,\big / \NN$ is a field.


Proof
By Quotient Ring of Cauchy Sequences is Division Ring then $\CC \,\big / \NN$ is a division ring.
By Corollary to Cauchy Sequences form Ring with Unity then $\CC$ is a commutative ring with unity.
By Quotient Ring of Commutative Ring is Commutative then $\CC \,\big / \NN$ is a commutative division ring, that is, a field.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
In equal circles, equal angles stand on equal arcs, whether at the center or at the circumference of those circles.

In the words of Euclid:

In equal circles equal angles stand on equal circumferences, whether at the center or at the circumferences.
(The Elements: Book $\text{III}$: Proposition $26$)


Proof
Let $ABC$ and $DEF$ be equal circles.
Let $\angle BGC = \angle EHF$ and $\angle BAC = \angle EDF$.


Let $BC$ and $EF$ be joined.
Since the circles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are equal, their radii are equal.
So $BG = EH$ and $CG = FH$.
We also have by hypothesis that $\angle BGC = \angle EHF$.
So from Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence it follows that $BC = EF$.

Since $\angle BAC = \angle EDF$ we have from Book $\text{III}$ Definition $11$: Similar Segments that segment $BAC$ is similar to segment $EDF$.
Moreover, these segments have equal bases.
So from Similar Segments on Equal Bases are Equal, segment $BAC$ is equal to segment $EDF$. 
But as $ABC$ and $DEF$ are equal circles, it follows that arc $BKC$ equals arc $ELF$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $26$ of Book $\text{III}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $27$: Angles on Equal Arcs are Equal.

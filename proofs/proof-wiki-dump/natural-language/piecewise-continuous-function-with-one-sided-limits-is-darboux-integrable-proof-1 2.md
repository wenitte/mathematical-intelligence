Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function defined on a closed interval $\closedint a b$.
Let $f$ be piecewise continuous with one-sided limits on $\closedint a b$.

Then $f$ is Darboux integrable on $\closedint a b$.


Proof
We are given that $f$ is piecewise continuous with one-sided limits on $\closedint a b$.
From Piecewise Continuous Function with One-Sided Limits is Bounded, $f$ is a bounded piecewise continuous function.
The result follows from Bounded Piecewise Continuous Function is Darboux Integrable.

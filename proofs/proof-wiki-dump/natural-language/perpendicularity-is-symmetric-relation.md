Theorem
Let $S$ be the set of straight lines in the plane.
For $l_1, l_2 \in S$, let $l_1 \perp l_2$ denote that $l_1$ is perpendicular to $l_2$.

Then $\perp$ is a symmetric relation on $S$.


Proof
Let $l_1 \perp l_2$.
By definition of perpendicular lines, $l_1$ meets $l_2$ at a right angle.
Hence $l_2$ similarly meets $l_1$ at a right angle.
That is:

$l_2 \perp l_1$
Thus $\parallel$ is seen to be symmetric.
$\blacksquare$

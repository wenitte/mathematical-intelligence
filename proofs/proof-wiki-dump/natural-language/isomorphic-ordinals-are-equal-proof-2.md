Theorem
Let $A$ and $B$ be ordinals that are order isomorphic.
Then $A = B$.


Proof
From Well-Ordered Class is not Isomorphic to Initial Segment, neither $A$ nor $B$ can be an initial segment of the other.
By definition, every element of an ordinal is an initial segment of it.
Hence, neither $A$ nor $B$ can be an element of the other.
By Ordinal Membership is Trichotomy, it follows that $A = B$.
$\blacksquare$

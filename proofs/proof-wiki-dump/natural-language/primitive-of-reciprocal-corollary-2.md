It has been suggested that this page or section be merged into Derivative of Natural Logarithm Function.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Mergeto}} from the code.

This page has been identified as a candidate for refactoring of basic complexity.In particular: What would probably be best would be for this to be a corollary of the above page.Until this has been finished, please leave {{Refactor}} in the code.
New contributors: Refactoring is a task which is expected to be undertaken by experienced editors only.

Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.
Corollary to Primitive of Reciprocal
$\dfrac {\d} {\d x} \ln \size x = \dfrac 1 x$
for $x \ne 0$.


Proof
Follows directly from Primitive of Reciprocal.
$\blacksquare$

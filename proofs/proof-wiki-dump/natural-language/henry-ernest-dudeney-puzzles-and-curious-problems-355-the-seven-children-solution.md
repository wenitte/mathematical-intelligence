Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $355$
The Seven Children
Four boys and three girls are seated in a row at random.
What are the chances that the two children at the end of each row will be girls?


Solution
$1$ in $7$.


Proof
From Number of Permutations, there are $7! = 5040$ ways in total of seating the $7$ children.
Now, we are given that there are $3$ girls.
The number of ways of seating the two girls at either end is the number of permutations of $2$ out of $3$.
From Number of Permutations again, this is:

${}^2 P_3 = \dfrac {3!} {\paren {3 - 2}!} = 3! = 6$
Having seated these two girls, there are $5$ children remaining to be seated in the remaining $5$ seats.
From Number of Permutations, there are $5! = 120$ ways of doing that.
Hence there are $6 \times 120 = 720$ ways of seating the children with a girl at either end.

Therefore the chances are $720$ in $5040$, or $1$ in $7$.
$\blacksquare$

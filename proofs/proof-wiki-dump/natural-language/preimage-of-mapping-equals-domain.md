Theorem
The preimage of a mapping is the same set as its domain:

$\Preimg f = \Dom f$


Proof
Let $f \subseteq S \times T$ be a mapping.

Then:














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \forall x \in S: \exists y \in T: \tuple {x, y} \in f\)





Definition of Mapping














\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds \forall x \in S: x \in \Preimg f\)





Definition of Preimage of Mapping














\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds S \subseteq \Preimg f\)





Definition of Subset




From Preimage of Relation is Subset of Domain, we have that $\Preimg f \subseteq S$.
The result follows from the definition of set equality.

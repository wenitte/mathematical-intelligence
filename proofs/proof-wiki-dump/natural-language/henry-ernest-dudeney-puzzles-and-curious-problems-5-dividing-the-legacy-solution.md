Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $5$
Dividing the Legacy
A man left $\pounds 100$ to be divided between his two sons Alfred and Benjamin.
If one-third of Alfred's legacy be taken from one-fourth of Benjamin's, the remainder would be $\pounds 11$.
What was the amount of each legacy?


Solution
Alfred gets $\pounds 24$ and Benjamin gets $\pounds 76$.


Proof
Let $A$ and $B$ be the amount of Alfred's and Benjamin's legacies respectively.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds A + B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





$\pounds 100$ to be divided between his two sons




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \dfrac B 4 - \dfrac A 3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 11\)





If one-third of Alfred's legacy be taken from one-fourth of Benjamin's, the remainder would be $\pounds 11$.




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 3 B - 4 A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 132\)





$(2) \times 12$




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 4 B + 4 A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 400\)





$(1) \times 4$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 7 B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 532\)





$(3) + (4)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 76\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 24\)

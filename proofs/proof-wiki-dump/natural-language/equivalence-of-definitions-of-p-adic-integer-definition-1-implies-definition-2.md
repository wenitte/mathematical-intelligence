Theorem
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers for some prime $p$.
Let $x \in \Q_p$ such that $\norm x_p \le 1$.

Then:

the canonical expansion of $x$ contains only positive powers of $p$
Proof
Let $x \in \Q_p$ such that $\norm x_p \le 1$.
From P-adic Integer is Limit of Unique P-adic Expansion, there exists a $p$-adic expansion of the form:

$\ds \sum_{n \mathop = 0}^\infty d_n p^n$
By definition of the canonical expansion:

$\ds \sum_{n \mathop = 0}^\infty d_n p^n$ is the canonical expansion of $x$
It follows that the canonical expansion of $x$ contains only positive powers of $p$.
$\blacksquare$

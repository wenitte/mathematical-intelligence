Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a Fort space on an infinite set $S$.

Then $T$ is a totally separated space.


Proof
Let $a, b \in S$ such that $a \ne b$.
From Clopen Points in Fort Space, all points in $S$ apart from $p$ are both open and closed in $T$.
Without loss of generality, suppose that $a \ne p$.
Then as $\set a$ is closed, $\relcomp S {\set a}$ is open in $T$.
So we have a partition $\set a \mid \relcomp S {\set a}$ of $S$ such that $a \in \set a, b \in \relcomp S {\set a}$.
So, by definition  $T$ is a totally separated space.
$\blacksquare$

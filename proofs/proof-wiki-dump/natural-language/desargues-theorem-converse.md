Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle A'B'C'$ be triangles lying in the same or different planes.
Let:

$BC$ meet $B'C'$ in $L$
$CA$ meet $C'A'$ in $M$
$AB$ meet $A'B'$ in $N$
where $L, M, N$ are collinear.

Then the lines $AA'$, $BB'$ and $CC'$ intersect in the point $O$.


Proof


Let $L$, $M$ and $N$ be collinear by hypothesis.
Then $\triangle BB'N$ and $\triangle CC'M$ are perspective with center $L$ ($L = BC \cap B'C' \cap MN$)
From Desargues' Theorem:

$O = BB' \cap CC'$
$A = BN \cap CM$
$A' = C'M \cap B'N$
are collinear.
Thus:

$AA' \cap BB' \cap CC' = O$
Hence $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle A'B'C'$ are perspective with center $O$.

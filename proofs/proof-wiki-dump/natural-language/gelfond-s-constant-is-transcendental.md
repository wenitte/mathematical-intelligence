Theorem
Gelfond's constant:

$e^\pi$
is transcendental.


Proof
From the Gelfond-Schneider Theorem:
If:

$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are algebraic numbers such that $\alpha \notin \set {0, 1}$
$\beta$ is either irrational or not wholly real
then $\alpha^\beta$ is transcendental.

We have that:














\(\ds i^{-2 i}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {e^{i \pi / 2} }^{- 2 i}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^{-\pi i^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^\pi\)










As:

$i$ is algebraic
$-2 i$ is algebraic and not wholly real
the conditions of the Gelfond-Schneider Theorem are fulfilled.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The question of the transcendental nature of Gelfond's constant $e^\pi$ was raised in the context of the $7$th problem of the Hilbert $23$.
That Gelfond's Constant is Transcendental was initially established in $1929$ by Alexander Osipovich Gelfond.
It was since determined to be a special case of the Gelfond-Schneider Theorem, established $\text {1934}$ – $\text {1935}$.

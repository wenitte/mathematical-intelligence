Theorem
Let $\GF \in \set {\R, \C}$. 
Let $\struct {X, \PP}$ be a locally convex space over $\GF$ equipped with the standard topology $\tau$. 

Then $\struct {X, \tau}$ is a topological vector space. 


Corollary
Let $\GF \in \set {\R, \C}$. 
Let $\struct {X, \PP}$ be a Hausdorff locally convex space over $\GF$ equipped with the standard topology $\tau$. 

Then $\struct {X, \tau}$ is a Hausdorff topological vector space. 


Proof
From Vector Addition on Locally Convex Space is Continuous, vector addition on $X$ is continuous. 
From Scalar Multiplication on Locally Convex Space is Continuous, scalar multiplication on $X$ is continuous. 
So $\struct {X, \tau}$ is a topological vector space.

Theorem
The complex cosine function is unbounded.

Proof
By Complex Cosine Function is Entire, we have that $\cos$ is an entire function. 
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose that $\cos$ is a bounded function.
By Liouville's Theorem, we have that $\cos$ is a constant function.
However, by Cosine of Zero is One: 

$\cos 0 = 1$
and by Cosine of Right Angle: 

$\cos \dfrac \pi 2 = 0$
Therefore, $\cos$ is not a constant function.
This contradicts the statement that $\cos$ is a constant function.
We hence conclude, by Proof by Contradiction, that our assumption that $\cos$ is a bounded function is false.
Hence $\cos$ is unbounded.

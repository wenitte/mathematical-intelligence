Theorem
Let $M = \struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,}}$ be a normed vector space.

Then the empty set $\O$ is an open set of $M$.


Proof
By definition, an open set $S \subseteq X$ is one where every point inside it is an element of an open ball contained entirely within that set.
That is, there are no points in $S$ which have an open ball some of whose elements are not in $S$.
As there are no elements in $\O$, the result follows vacuously.
$\blacksquare$

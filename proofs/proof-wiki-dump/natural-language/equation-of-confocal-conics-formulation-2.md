Definition
The equation:

$(1): \quad \dfrac {x^2} {a^2} + \dfrac {y^2} {a^2 - c^2} = 1$
where:

$\tuple {x, y}$ denotes an arbitrary point in the cartesian plane
$c$ is a (strictly) positive constant
$a$ is a (strictly) positive parameter
defines the set of all confocal conics whose foci are at $\tuple {\pm c, 0}$.


Proof
Let $a > c$.
Then from Equation of Confocal Ellipses: Formulation 2, $(1)$ defines the set of all confocal ellipses whose foci are at $\tuple {\pm c, 0}$.

Let $a < c$.
Then from Equation of Confocal Hyperbolas, $(1)$ defines the set of all confocal hyperbolas whose foci are at $\tuple {\pm c, 0}$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

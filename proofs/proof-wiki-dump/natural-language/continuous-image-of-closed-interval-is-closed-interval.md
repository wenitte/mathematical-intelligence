Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function which is continuous on the closed interval $\left[{a \,.\,.\, b}\right]$.

Then the image of $\left[{a \,.\,.\, b}\right]$ under $f$ is also a closed interval.


Proof
Let $I = \left[{a \,.\,.\, b}\right]$.
Let $J = f \left({I}\right)$.
From Image of Interval by Continuous Function is Interval, $J$ is an interval.
From Image of Closed Real Interval is Bounded, $J$ is bounded.
From Max and Min of Function on Closed Real Interval‎, $J$ includes its end points.
Hence the result.

Some sources refer to this as the continuity property, but this is not standard, and is too easily confused with the Continuum Property.

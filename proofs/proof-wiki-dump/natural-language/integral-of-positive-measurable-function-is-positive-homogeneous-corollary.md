Corollary to Integral of Positive Measurable Function is Positive Homogeneous
Let $\struct {X, \Sigma, \mu}$ be a measure space.
Let $fÂ : X \to \overline \R$ be a positive $\Sigma$-measurable function.
Let $\lambda \in \overline \R$ be an extended real number with $\lambda \ge 0$. 
Let $A \in \Sigma$. 

Then: 

$\ds \int_A \lambda f \rd \mu = \lambda \int_A f \rd \mu$
where:

$\lambda f$ is the pointwise $\lambda$-multiple of $f$
the integral sign denotes $\mu$-integration over $A$.
This can be summarized by saying that $\ds \int_A \cdot \rd \mu$ is positive homogeneous.


Proof
We have: 














\(\ds \int_A \lambda f \rd \mu\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \int \paren {\lambda f \times \chi_A} \rd \mu\)

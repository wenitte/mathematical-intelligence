Theorem
Let $\Z$ be the set of all integers.
Let $\Z_{>0}$ be the set of strictly positive integers.
Let $m \in \Z_{>0}$ and let $n \in \Z$.
Let $\ideal m$ be the principal ideal of $\Z$ generated by $m$.

Then:

$m \divides n \iff \ideal n \subseteq \ideal m$


Proof
The ring of integers is a principal ideal domain.
The result follows directly from Principal Ideals in Integral Domain.
$\blacksquare$

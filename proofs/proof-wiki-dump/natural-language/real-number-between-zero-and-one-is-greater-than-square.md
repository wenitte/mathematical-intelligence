Theorem
Let $x \in \R$.
Let $0 < x < 1$.

Then:

$0 < x^2 < x$


Proof 1
We are given that $0 < x < 1$.
By direct application of Real Number Ordering is Compatible with Multiplication, it follows that:

$0 \times x < x \times x < 1 \times x$
and the result follows.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
We have that Real Numbers form Ordered Integral Domain.
Thus Square of Element Less than Unity in Ordered Integral Domain applies directly.
$\blacksquare$

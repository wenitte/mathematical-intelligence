Theorem
Let $A_4$ denote the alternating group on $4$ letters.
$A_4$ has no subgroup of order $6$.


Proof
We list the subgroups of $A_4$:
The subsets of $A_4$ which form subgroups of $A_4$ are as follows:

Trivial:














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set e\)





Trivial Subgroup is Subgroup














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds A_4\)





Group is Subgroup of Itself




Order $2$ subgroups:














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, t}\)





as $t^2 = e$














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, u}\)





as $u^2 = e$














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, v}\)





as $v^2 = e$




Order $3$ subgroups:














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, a, p}\)





as $a^2 = p$, $a^3 = a p = e$














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, b, s}\)





as $b^2 = s$, $b^3 = b s = e$














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, c, q}\)





as $c^2 = q$, $c^3 = c q = e$














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, d, r}\)





as $d^2 = r$, $d^3 = d r = e$




Order $4$ subgroup:














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, t, u, v}\)





Klein $4$-Group




So there is no subgroup of $A_4$ of order $6$.

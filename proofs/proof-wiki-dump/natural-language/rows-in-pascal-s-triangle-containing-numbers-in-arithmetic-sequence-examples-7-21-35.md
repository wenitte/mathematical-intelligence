Example of Rows in Pascal's Triangle containing Numbers in Arithmetic Sequence
The integers:

$7, 21, 35$
are in arithmetic sequence and appear in row $7$ of Pascal's triangle.


Proof
We have:














\(\ds 21 - 7\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 14\)




















\(\ds 35 - 21\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 14\)









thus demonstrating the common difference of $14$.

Then we have that row $7$ of Pascal's triangle is:

$1, \color {red} {7, 21, 35}, 35, 21, 7, 1$
$\blacksquare$

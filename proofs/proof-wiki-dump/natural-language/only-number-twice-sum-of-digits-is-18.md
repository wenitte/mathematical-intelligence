Theorem
There exists only one (strictly) positive integer that is exactly twice the sum of its digits. 


Proof
Let $n$ be equal to twice the sum of its digits.
Suppose $n$ has $1$ digit.
Then $n$ equals the sum of its digits.
Thus $n$ does not have only $1$ digit.

Suppose $n$ has $3$ digits.
Then $n > 99$.
But the highest number that can be formed by the sum of $3$ digits is $9 + 9 + 9 = 27$.
Similarly for if $n$ has more than $3$ digits.

Hence, if there exists such a number, it must have exactly $2$ digits.
Let the $2$ digits of $n$ be $x$ and $y$.
Thus:














\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10 x + y\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \left({x + y}\right)\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 8 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y\)









Since $x$ and $y$ are both single digits, it follows that $x = 1$ and $y = 8$.
Hence the result.

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be an algebraic structure.
Let $e_L \in S$ be a left identity with respect to $\circ$.

Then $e_L$ is idempotent under $\circ$.


Proof
By the definition of a left identity:

$\forall x \in S: e_L \circ x = x$
Thus in particular:

$e_L \circ e_L = e_L$
Therefore $e_L$ is idempotent under $\circ$.
$\blacksquare$

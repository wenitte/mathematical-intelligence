Example of Reversal formed by Repdigits of Base minus 1 by Addition and Multiplication













\(\ds 7 + 7\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16_8\)




















\(\ds 7 \times 7\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 61_8\)











Proof
A direct application of Reversal formed by Repdigits of Base minus 1 by Addition and Multiplication:
$\blacksquare$

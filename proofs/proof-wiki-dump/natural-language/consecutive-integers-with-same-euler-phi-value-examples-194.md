Example of Consecutive Integers with Same Euler Phi Value
Let $\phi: \Z_{>0} \to \Z_{>0}$ denote the Euler $\phi$ function: the number of strictly positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which are prime to $n$.
Then:

$\map \phi {194} = \map \phi {195} = 96$


Proof
From $\phi$ of $194$:

$\map \phi {194} = 96$
From $\phi$ of $195$:

$\map \phi {195} = 96$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $A$ be a compact topological space.
Let $C A$ denote the cone on $A$.
Then, $C A$ is compact.


Proof
By definition of cone:

$C A = T \ast A$
where:

$T$ denotes the trivial topological space
$T \ast A$ denotes the join of $T$ and $A$
By Finite Topological Space is Compact, $T$ is compact.
Therefore, by Join of Compact Spaces is Compact:

$C A$ is compact.

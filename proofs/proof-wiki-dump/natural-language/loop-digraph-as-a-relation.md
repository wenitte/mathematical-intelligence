Theorem
A loop-digraph is the same thing as a relational structure.


Proof
A loop-digraph is a graph such that:

it is not necessarily antireflexive
it is not necessarily symmetric.
Hence a loop-digraph is an ordered pair:

$G = \struct {V, E}$
such that:

$V$ is a set of objects
$E$ is a relation on $V$.
This defines a relational structure.
$\blacksquare$

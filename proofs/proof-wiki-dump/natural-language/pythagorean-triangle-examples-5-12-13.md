Example of Primitive Pythagorean Triangle
The triangle whose sides are of length $5$, $12$ and $13$ is a primitive Pythagorean triangle.





Proof













\(\ds 5^2 + 12^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25 + 144\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 169\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13^2\)









It follows by Pythagoras's Theorem that $5$, $12$ and $13$ form a Pythagorean triple.

Note that $5$ and $12$ are coprime.
Hence, by definition, $5$, $12$ and $13$ form a primitive Pythagorean triple.
The result follows by definition of a primitive Pythagorean triangle.
$\blacksquare$

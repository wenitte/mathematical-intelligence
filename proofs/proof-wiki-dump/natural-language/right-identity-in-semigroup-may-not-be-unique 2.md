Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a semigroup.
Let $e_R$ be a right identity of $\struct {S, \circ}$.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $e_R$ is unique.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample
Let $\struct {S, \gets}$ be an algebraic structure in which the operation $\gets$ is the left operation.
From Structure under Left Operation is Semigroup, $\struct {S, \gets}$ is a semigroup.
From Element under Left Operation is Right Identity, every element of $\struct {S, \gets}$ is a right identity.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

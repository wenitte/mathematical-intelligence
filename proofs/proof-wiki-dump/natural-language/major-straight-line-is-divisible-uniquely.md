Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

A major straight line is divided at one and the same point only.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $45$)


Proof
Let $AB$ be a major straight line.
Let $AB$ be divided at $C$ to create $AC$ and $CB$ such that:

$AC$ and $CB$ are incommensurable in square
$AC^2 + CB^2$ is rational
$AC$ and $CB$ contain a medial rectangle.
Let $AB$ be divided at $D$ such that $AD$ and $DB$ have the same properties as $AB$ and $CB$.
From Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{II} $: Square of Sum:

$AB^2 = \left({AC + CB}\right)^2 = AC^2 + CB^2 + 2 \cdot AC \cdot CB$
and:

$AB^2 = \left({AD + DB}\right)^2 = AD^2 + DB^2 + 2 \cdot AD \cdot DB$
and so:

$\left({AC^2 + CB^2}\right) - \left({AD^2 + DB^2}\right) = 2 \cdot AD \cdot DB - 2 \cdot AC \cdot CB$
But $AB^2 + CB^2$ and $AD^2 + DB^2$ are rational.
So $\left({AC^2 + CB^2}\right) - \left({AD^2 + DB^2}\right)$ is rational.
Therefore $2 \cdot AD \cdot DB - 2 \cdot AC \cdot CB$ is rational.
But $2 \cdot AD \cdot DB$ and $2 \cdot AC \cdot CB$ are medial.
From Proposition $26$ of Book $\text{X} $: Medial Area not greater than Medial Area by Rational Area this cannot be the case.
So there can be no such $D$.

Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $45$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

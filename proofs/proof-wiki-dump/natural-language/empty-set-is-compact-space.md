Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.

Then the empty set $\O$ is a compact subspace of $T$.


Proof
Recall the definition of compact subspace:

$\struct {\O, \tau_\O}$ is compact in $T$ if and only if every open cover $\CC \subseteq \tau_\O$ for $\O$ has a finite subcover.
The only open cover for $\O$ that is contained in $\O$ is $\set \O$ itself.
This has only one finite subcover, and that is $\set \O$.
This is a finite subcover.
Hence the result, by definition of compact subspace.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a paracompact space.
Then $T$ is also metacompact.


Proof
From the definition, $T$ is paracompact if and only if every open cover of $T$ has an open refinement which is locally finite.
Consider some open cover $\UU$ of $T$.
Let $x \in S$.
Then there exists some neighborhood $\exists N_x$ of $x$ which intersects only finitely many elements of $\UU$.
Thus $x$ itself can be in only finitely many elements of $\UU$.
Hence $T$ must be, by definition, metacompact.
$\blacksquare$

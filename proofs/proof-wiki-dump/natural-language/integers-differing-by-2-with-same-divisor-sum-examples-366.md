Example of Integers Differing by 2 with Same Divisor Sum
Let $\sigma_1: \Z_{>0} \to \Z_{>0}$ denote the divisor sum function.
Then:

$\map {\sigma_1} {366} = \map {\sigma_1} {368} = 744$


Proof
From $\sigma_1$ of $366$:

$\map {\sigma_1} {366} = 744$
From $\sigma_1$ of $368$:

$\map {\sigma_1} {368} = 744$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $A$ be a set.
Let $\RR$ and $\SS$ be orderings on $A$.

Then $\RR \cap \SS$ is an ordering on $A$.


Proof
By definition of ordering:

$\RR$ and $\SS$ are reflexive
$\RR$ and $\SS$ are transitive
$\RR$ and $\SS$ are antisymmetric.

We have:

Intersection of Reflexive Relations is Reflexive
Intersection of Transitive Relations is Transitive
Intersection of Antisymmetric Relations is Antisymmetric
and the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {F, +, \times}$ be a field.
Then $E$ contains at least $2$ elements.


Proof
By definition, $\struct {F, +, \times}$ is an algebraic structure such that:

$\struct {F, +}$ is an abelian group whose identity element is $0 \in F$
$\struct {F^*, \times}$ is also an abelian group, where $F^* = F \setminus \set 0$.
From Group is not Empty, $\struct {F^*, \times}$ cannot be the empty set.
So there are at least $2$ elements in $F$: 

the identity element $0$ of $\struct {F, +}$
the identity element $1$ of $\struct {F^*, \times}$.
$\blacksquare$

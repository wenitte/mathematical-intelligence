Conjecture
The last digit of the sequence of perfect numbers alternates between $6$ and $8$:

$6$
$28$
$496$
$8128$


Refutation
The sequence continues:

$33 \, 550 \, 336$
$8 \, 589 \, 869 \, 056$
... two consecutive perfect numbers ending in $6$.
$\blacksquare$

Perfect Number ends in 6 or 28 preceded by Odd Digit


Historical Note
The conjecture that there is Last Digit of Perfect Numbers Alternates between $6$ and $8$ was made by Nicomachus of Gerasa in his Introduction to Arithmetic, published some time around the $2$nd century.
It was a simple extrapolation from the knowledge of the perfect numbers at the time.
Some sources suggest that Iamblichus Chalcidensis made these conjectures, but this appears to be incorrect.

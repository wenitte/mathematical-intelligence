Theorem
Let $a$ be a set.

The following statements are equivalent:

$(1): \quad \bigcup a \subseteq a$
$(2): \quad a \subseteq \powerset a$
$(3): \quad a$ is a transitive set


Proof
$(1) \iff (3)$
This is shown in Class is Transitive iff Union is Subclass.
$\Box$


$(2) \iff (3)$
This is shown in Set is Transitive iff Subset of Power Set.
$\blacksquare$

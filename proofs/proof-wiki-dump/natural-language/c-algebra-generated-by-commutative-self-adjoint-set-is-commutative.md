Theorem
Let $\struct {A, \ast, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a $\text C^\ast$-algebra.
Let $S \subseteq A$ be a self-adjoint set such that:

$x y = y x$ for each $x, y \in S$.
Let $\map {\text C^\ast} S$ be the $\text C^\ast$-algebra generated by $S$. 

Then $\map {\text C^\ast} S$ is commutative.  


Proof
Let $C$ be the subalgebra generated by $S$. 
From Subalgebra Generated by Commuting Elements is Commutative, $C$ is commutative.
From Explicit Form for Generated C*-Algebra, we have $\map {\text C^\ast} S = C^-$. 
From Closure of Commutative Set in Banach Algebra is Commutative, $C^-$ is commutative.
Hence $\map {\text C^\ast} S$ is commutative.

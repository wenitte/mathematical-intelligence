Theorem
Let $\LL$ be a straight line which intercepts the $x$-axis and $y$-axis respectively at $\tuple {a, 0}$ and $\tuple {0, b}$, where $a b \ne 0$.

Then $\LL$ can be described by the equation:

$\dfrac x a + \dfrac y b = 1$


Proof

We have that $\LL$ is passes through the two points $A = \tuple {a, 0}$ and $B = \tuple {0, b}$.
Let $P = \tuple {x, y}$ be an arbitrary point on $\LL$.
We have:














\(\ds \triangle OBP + \triangle OAP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \triangle OAB\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {b x} 2 + \dfrac {a y} 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {a b} 2\)





Area of Triangle in Terms of Side and Altitude








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b x + a y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a b\)





multiplying both sides by $2$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac x a + \dfrac y b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)





dividing both sides by $a b$ and rearranging



$\blacksquare$

Example of Denial of Universality
Let $S \subseteq \R$ be a subset of the real numbers.
Let $P$ be the statement:

$\forall x \in S: x \le 3$
The negation of $P$ is the statement written in its simplest form as:

$\exists x \in S: x > 3$


Proof

\(\)







\(\ds \lnot \forall x \in S: x \le 3\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds \exists x \in S: \lnot \paren {x \le 3}\)

Examples
Example where $S = \set {2, 3, 4}$
Let $P$ be the statement:

$\forall x \in S: x \le 3$
and $\lnot P$ its negation:

$\exists x \in S: x > 3$

Let $S = \set {2, 3, 4}$.
Then we have that:

$P$ is false
and consequently:

$\lnot P$ is true


Example where $S = \closedint 0 3$
Let $P$ be the statement:

$\forall x \in S: x \le 3$
and $\lnot P$ its negation:

$\exists x \in S: x > 3$

Let $S = \closedint 0 3$ where $\closedint \cdot \cdot$ denotes a closed real interval.
Then we have that:

$P$ is true
and consequently:

$\lnot P$ is false

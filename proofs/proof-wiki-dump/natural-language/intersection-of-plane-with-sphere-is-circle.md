Theorem
The intersection of a plane with a sphere is a circle.


Proof
Let $S$ be a sphere of radius $R$ whose center is located for convenience at the origin.
Let $P$ be a plane which intersects $S$ but is not a tangent plane to $S$.
It is to be shown that $S \cap P$ is a circle.

Let $S$ and $P$ be embedded in a (real) cartesian space of $3$ dimensions.
Let this space be rotated until $P$ is parallel to the plane $z = 0$.
Thus from the Equation of Plane we have that $P$ can be described as:

$z = c$
where $\size c < R$ (or $P$ would not intersect $S$).
Let $A = \tuple {x, y, z}$ be an arbitrary point on $S \cap P$.
We have that:














\(\ds x^2 + y^2 + z^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds R^2\)





Equation of Sphere








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 + y^2 + c^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds R^2\)





Equation of Plane: $z - c$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 + y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds R^2 - c^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(>\)







\(\ds 0\)





as $-R < c < R$



The result follows from Equation of Circle.

Definition
Let $\CC$ be a circle.
Let $\triangle PQR$ be a triangle such that:

$PR$ is the polar of $Q$
$QR$ is the polar of $P$
with respect to $\CC$.

Then

$PQ$ is the polar of $R$
and so $\triangle PQR$ is conjugate to itself.

Hence a self-conjugate triangle requires just two sides to be specified as polars of their opposite vertices.
The third side is the polar of its opposite vertex as a consequence.


Proof
We have that:

the polar of $P$ is $QR$
the polar of $Q$ is $PR$
and so both polars pass through $R$.
Therefore:

the polar of $R$ is $PQ$.

Theorem
The Julian year and the tropical year differ such that the Julian calendar becomes $1$ day further out approximately every $128$ years.


Proof
By definition, the length $Y_T$ of the tropical year is defined as $\approx 365 \cdotp 24219 \, 878$ days
By definition of the Julian year:

$Y_J = \begin{cases} 366 \, \text {days} & : 4 \divides y \\
365 \, \text {days} & : 4 \nmid y \end{cases}$
where:

$Y_J$ denotes the length of the Julian year in days
$y$ denotes the number of the year
$4 \divides y$ denotes that $y$ is divisible by $4$
$4 \nmid y$ denotes that $y$ is not divisible by $4$.

Thus:














\(\ds 4 Y_J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 365 + 366\)





considering $4$ consecutive Julian years








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds Y_J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {1461} 4\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 365 \cdotp 25\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds Y_J - Y_T\)

\(\approx\)







\(\ds 365 \cdotp 25 - 365 \cdotp 24219 \, 878\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\approx\)







\(\ds 0 \cdotp 0078013\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\approx\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {128 \cdotp 18}\)









Thus the mean Julian year is $\dfrac 1 {128 \cdotp 18}$ days longer than the tropical year.
This means that after approximately $128$ Julian years, the Julian calendar starts one day later relative to the tropical year.

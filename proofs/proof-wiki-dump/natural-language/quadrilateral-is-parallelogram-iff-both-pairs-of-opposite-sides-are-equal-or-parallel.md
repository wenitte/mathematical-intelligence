Theorem
Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral.
Then:

$ABCD$ is a parallelogram
if and only if:

either $AB = CD$ and $AD = BC$
or $AB \parallel CD$ and $AD \parallel BC$
where $AB \parallel CD$ denotes that $AB$ is parallel to $CD$.


Proof
Sufficient Condition
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram.
Then by definition:

$AB \parallel CD$ and $AD \parallel BC$
and from Opposite Sides and Angles of Parallelogram are Equal:

$AB = CD$ and $AD = BC$
From Conjunction implies Disjunction, it follows that:

either $AB = CD$ and $AD = BC$
or $AB \parallel CD$ and $AD \parallel BC$.
$\Box$


Necessary Condition
Let $ABCD$ be such that:

either $AB = CD$ and $AD = BC$
or $AB \parallel CD$ and $AD \parallel BC$.

First suppose that $AB = CD$ and $AD = BC$.
Then from Opposite Sides Equal implies Parallelogram, $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.

Now suppose that $AB \parallel CD$ and $AD \parallel BC$.
Then $ABCD$ is a parallelogram by definition.

Hence the result by Proof by Cases.
$\blacksquare$

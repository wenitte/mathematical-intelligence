Theorem
There exists at least one example of a strongly locally compact topological space which is not also a weakly $\sigma$-locally compact space.


Proof
Let $T$ be an uncountable discrete space.

From Discrete Space is Strongly Locally Compact, $T$ is a strongly locally compact space.
From Uncountable Discrete Space is not $\sigma$-Compact, $T$ is not a weakly $\sigma$-compact space.
By definition, it follows that $T$ is not a weakly $\sigma$-locally compact space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

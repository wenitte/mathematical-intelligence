Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

To find the second binomial straight line.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $49$)


Proof

Let $AC$ and $CB$ be straight lines constructed such that $AB = AC + CB$ is itself a straight line.
Using Lemma 1 to Proposition $28$ of Book $\text{X} $: Construction of Rational Straight Lines Commensurable in Square Only whose Square Differences Commensurable with Greater, let:

$AB : BC = m^2 : n^2$
where $m$ and $n$ are numbers such that $m^2 - n^2$ is not square.

Let $D$ be a rational straight line.
Let $EF$ be constructed commensurable in length with $D$.
Then $EF$ is also a rational straight line.
Using Porism to Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{X} $: Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable, let:

$CA : AB = EF^2 : FG^2$
where $FG$ is a straight line constructed such that $EG = EF + FG$ is itself a straight line.
From Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{X} $: Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable:

$EF^2 : FG^2 = m^2 : \left({m^2 - n^2}\right)$
$EF$ and $FG$ are commensurable in square.
But from Proposition $9$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Squares:
$EF$ and $FG$  are incommensurable in length.
Therefore $EF$ and $FG$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Therefore by definition $EG$ is a binomial.

We have that:

$BA : AC = GF^2 : FE^2$
while:

$BA > AC$
Therefore:

$GF^2 > FE^2$
Let:

$FE^2 + H^2 = GF^2$
for some $H$.
From Porism to Proposition $19$ of Book $\text{V} $: Proportional Magnitudes have Proportional Remainders:

$AB : BC = FG^2 : H$
But $AB : BC$ has the ratio that a square number has to a square number.
Therefore by Proposition $9$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Squares:

$FG$ is commensurable in length with $H$.
Therefore $FG^2$ is greater than $FE^2$ by the square on a straight line commensurable with $EF$.
We have that:

$EF$ and $FG$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only
and:

$EF$ is commensurable in length with $D$.
Therefore $EG$ is a second binomial straight line.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $49$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

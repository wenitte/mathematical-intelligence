Example of Divergent Real Sequence to Infinity
Let $\sequence {a_n}_{n \mathop \ge 1}$ be the real sequence defined as:

$a_n = \paren {-1} n$

Then $\sequence {a_n}$ is divergent to $\infty$.

However, $\sequence {a_n}$ is neither divergent to $+\infty$ nor divergent to $-\infty$.


Proof
We have that:

$\size {a_n} = n$
Let $H \in \R_{>0}$ be given.
Then by the Axiom of Archimedes:

$\exists N \in \N: N > H$
and so for $n \ge N$:

$n > H$
Thus $\sequence {a_n}$ is divergent to $\infty$.
But $\sequence {a_n}$ cannot be divergent to $+\infty$ because all its odd terms are negative.
Neither can $\sequence {a_n}$ cannot be divergent to $-\infty$ because all its even terms are positive.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a group.
Let $\RR$ be a relation on $S$ which is compatible with $\circ$.
Let $\RR^\ne$ be the reflexive reduction of $\RR$.

Then $\RR^\ne$ is compatible with $\circ$.


Proof
From the Cancellation Laws, $\circ$ is a cancellable operation.
The result then follows directly from Reflexive Reduction of Relation Compatible with Cancellable Operation is Compatible.
$\blacksquare$

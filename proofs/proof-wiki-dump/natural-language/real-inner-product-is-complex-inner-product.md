Theorem
Let $V$ be a vector space over a real subfield $\GF$.
Let $\innerprod \cdot \cdot: V \times V \to \GF$ be a real inner product.

Then $\innerprod \cdot \cdot$ is a complex inner product

Proof
This follows immediately from:

Definition of Real Inner Product
Definition of Complex Inner Product
Complex Number equals Conjugate iff Wholly Real
$\blacksquare$

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $114$
Elementary Arithmetic
If a quarter of twenty is four, what would a third of ten be?


Solution
$2 \tfrac 2 3$


Proof
According to Dudeney, this is:

merely a sum in simple proportion:
If $5$ be $4$, then:

$3 \tfrac 1 3$ is $3 \tfrac 1 3 \times \dfrac 4 5 = \dfrac {10 \times 4} {3 \times 5} = 2 \tfrac 2 3$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This is the kind of question that was very popular in Venice and elsewhere about the middle of the sixteenth century.
Nicola Fontana, generally known as "Tartaglia" (the stammerer) was largely responsible for the invention.

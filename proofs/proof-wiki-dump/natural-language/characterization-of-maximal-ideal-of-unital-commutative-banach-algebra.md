Theorem
Let $\struct {A, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a commutative unital Banach algebra over $\C$. 
Let $M \subseteq A$.

Then $M$ is maximal if and only if there exists a character $\phi$ with $M = \ker \phi$.


Proof
Necessary Condition
This is Maximal Ideal of Unital Commutative Banach Algebra is Kernel of Character.
$\Box$

Sufficient Condition
This is Kernel of Character on Unital Commutative Banach Algebra is Maximal Ideal.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\left({R, +, \circ}\right)$ be a ring.
The elements of $R$ are partitioned into three classes:

$(1): \quad$ the zero
$(2): \quad$ the units
$(3): \quad$ the proper elements.


Proof
By definition, a proper element is a non-zero element which has no product inverse.
Also by definition, a unit is an element which does have a product inverse.
Because $0 \circ x = 0$ there can be no $x \in R$ such that $0 \times x = 1$, and so $0$ is not a unit.
Hence the result.

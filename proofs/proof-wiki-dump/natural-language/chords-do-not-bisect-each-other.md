Theorem
If in a circle two chords (which are not diameters) cut one another, then they do not bisect one another.

In the words of Euclid:

If in a circle two straight lines cut one another which are not through the centre, they do not bisect one another.
(The Elements: Book $\text{III}$: Proposition $4$)


Proof

Let $ABCD$ be a circle, in which $AC$ and $BD$ are chords which are not diameters (i.e. they do not pass through the center).
Let $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$.

Aiming for a contradiction, suppose they were able to bisect one another, such that $AE = EC$ and $BE = ED$.
Find the center $F$ of the circle, and join $FE$.
From Conditions for Diameter to be Perpendicular Bisector, as $FE$ bisects $AC$, then it cuts it at right angles.
So $\angle FEA$ is a right angle.
Similarly, $\angle FEB$ is a right angle.
So $\angle FEA = \angle FEB$, and they are clearly unequal.
From this contradiction, it follows that $AC$ and $BD$ can not bisect each other.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{III}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

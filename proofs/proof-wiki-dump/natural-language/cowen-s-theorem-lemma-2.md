Lemma for Cowen's Theorem
Let $g$ be a progressing mapping.
Let $x$ be a set.
Let $\powerset x$ denote the power set of $x$.
Let $M_x$ denote the intersection of the $x$-special subsets of $\powerset x$ with respect to $g$.

Let $M$ be the class of all $x$ such that $x \in M_x$.
We have that:

$\O \in M$


Proof
By Lemma $1$:

$\powerset \O$ is $\O$-special with respect to $g$.
By Power Set of Empty Set:

$\powerset \O = \set \O$
Hence:

$\set \O$ is $\O$-special with respect to $g$.
The only other subset of $\set \O$ is $\O$, which is by definition empty.
So $\set \O$ is the only $\O$-special subset of $\powerset \O$ with respect to $g$.
Hence:

$M_\O = \set \O$
Because $\O \in \set \O$, we have:

$\O \in M_\O$
and so:

$\O \in M$
$\blacksquare$

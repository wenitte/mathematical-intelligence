Theorem
Problem Definition

Consider a cart $C$ of mass $m$ attached to a wall by means of a spring $S$.
Let $C$ be free to move along a horizontal straight line with zero friction.
Let the force constant of $S$ be $k$.
Let the displacement of $C$ at time $t$ from the equilibrium position be $\mathbf x$.

Then the motion of $C$ is described by the second order ODE:

$\dfrac {\d^2 \mathbf x} {\d t^2} + \dfrac k m \mathbf x = 0$


Proof
By Newton's Second Law of Motion, the force on $C$ equals its mass times its acceleration:

$\mathbf F = m \mathbf a$
By Acceleration is Second Derivative of Displacement with respect to Time:

$\mathbf a = \dfrac {\d^2 \mathbf x} {\d t^2}$
By Hooke's Law:

$\mathbf F = -k \mathbf x$
So:














\(\ds m \mathbf a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -k \mathbf x\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds m \dfrac {\d^2 \mathbf x} {\d t^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -k \mathbf x\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {\d^2 \mathbf x} {\d t^2} + \dfrac k m \mathbf x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)

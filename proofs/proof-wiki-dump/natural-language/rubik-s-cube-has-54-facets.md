Theorem
Let $S$ be the set of facets of Rubik's cube.
Then the cardinality of $S$ is given by:

$\card S = 54$

That is:

A Rubik's cube has $54$ facets.


Proof
A cube, by definition, has $6$ faces.
Each face is subdivided into $9$ facets.
Hence there are $6 \times 9 = 54$ facets in total.
$\blacksquare$

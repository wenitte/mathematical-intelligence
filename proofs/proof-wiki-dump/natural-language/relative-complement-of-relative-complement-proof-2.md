Theorem
$\relcomp S {\relcomp S T} = T$


Proof













\(\ds \relcomp S {\relcomp S T}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds S \setminus \paren {S \setminus T}\)





Definition of Relative Complement














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds S \cap T\)





Set Difference with Set Difference




The definition of the relative complement requires that:

$T \subseteq S$
But from Intersection with Subset is Subsetâ€Ž:

$T \subseteq S \iff T \cap S = T$
Thus:

$\relcomp S {\relcomp S T} = T$
follows directly.
$\blacksquare$

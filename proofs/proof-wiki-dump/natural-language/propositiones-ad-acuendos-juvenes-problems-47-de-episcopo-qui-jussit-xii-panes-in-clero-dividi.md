Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $47$
De Episcopo qui Jussit $\text {XII}$ Panes in Clero Dividi
A Bishop Dividing $12$ Loaves Among his Clergy
A certain bishop ordered that $12$ loaves be divided among his clergy.
He ordered that:
each priest should receive $2$ loaves,
each deacon one half
and each reader one quarter.
There were as many loaves as clergy.
How many priests, deacons and readers must there be?


Solution
$5$ priests
$1$ deacon
$6$ readers.


Proof
Let $p$, $d$ and $r$ denote the number of priests, deacons and readers respectively.
We are to solve for $p, d, r\in \N$:














\(\ds 2 p + \dfrac d 2 + \dfrac r 4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)










\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 8 p + 2 d + r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 48\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds p + d + r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 7 p + d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 36\)





$(1) - (2)$



Thus:

$d = 36 - 7 p$

Inspecting possible contenders for $p$ and $d$ individually, and calculating $r$:












\(\, \ds p = 1: \, \)

\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 36 - 1 \times 7\)

\(\ds = 29\)
















\(\, \ds p = 2: \, \)

\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 36 - 2 \times 7\)

\(\ds = 22\)
















\(\, \ds p = 3: \, \)

\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 36 - 3 \times 7\)

\(\ds = 15\)
















\(\, \ds p = 4: \, \)

\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 36 - 4 \times 7\)

\(\ds = 8\)
















\(\, \ds p = 5: \, \)

\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 36 - 5 \times 7\)

\(\ds = 1\)







Only $2$ of these satisfie the condition that $12 - \paren {p + 2} \ge 0$.

$p = 4$, $d = 8$, $r = 0$
$p = 5$, $d = 1$, $r = 6$

It is understood that there is at least one reader.
Hence the result:

$p = 5$, $d = 1$, $r = 6$
Thus:

the priests get $10$ loaves between them;
the deacon gets half a loaf;
the readers get $1 \frac 1 2$ loaves divided between them.
$\blacksquare$

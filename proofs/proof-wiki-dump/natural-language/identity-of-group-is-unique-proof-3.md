Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group which has an identity element $e \in G$.
Then $e$ is unique.


Proof
From Group has Latin Square Property, there exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:

$a x = b$
and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:

$y a = b$
Setting $b = a$, this becomes:
There exists a unique $x \in G$ such that:

$a x = a$
and there exists a unique $y \in G$ such that:

$y a = a$
These $x$ and $y$ are both $e$, by definition of identity element.
$\blacksquare$

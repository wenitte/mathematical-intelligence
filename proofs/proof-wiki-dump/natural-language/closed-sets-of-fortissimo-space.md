Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a Fortissimo space.

Then $H \subseteq S$ is closed in $T$ if and only if:

$p \in H$
or

$H$ is countable
or both.


Proof
By definition of a Fortissimo space, $U \subseteq S$ is open in $T$ if and only if:

$p \in \relcomp S U$
or

$\relcomp S U$ is countable
or both.
The result follows from the definition of closed set.
$\blacksquare$

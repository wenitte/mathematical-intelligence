Theorem
Let $\mathbf A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & a_{22} & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & a_{nn} \\
\end{bmatrix}$ be a diagonal matrix.
Then the determinant of $\mathbf A$ is the product of the elements of $\mathbf A$.
That is:

$\ds \map \det {\mathbf A} = \prod_{i \mathop = 1}^n a_{ii}$


Proof
As a diagonal matrix is also a triangular matrix (both upper and lower), the result follows directly from Determinant of Triangular Matrix.

Theorem
Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent continuous random variables each with a normal distribution with:

zero expectation
the same variance $\sigma$:













\(\ds X\)

\(\sim\)







\(\ds \Gaussian 0 {\sigma^2}\)




















\(\ds Y\)

\(\sim\)







\(\ds \Gaussian 0 {\sigma^2}\)









Let $U$ be the continuous random variable defined as:

$U = \dfrac X Y$

Then $U$ has the Cauchy distribution:

$U \sim \Cauchy 0 1$
and so does $\dfrac 1 U$:

$\dfrac 1 U \sim \Cauchy 0 1$


Proof
From Quotient of Normal Distributions has Cauchy Distribution:

$U \sim \Cauchy 0 \lambda$
where:

$\lambda = \dfrac {\sigma_x} {\sigma_y}$
and such that:

$\sigma_x = \sigma_y = \sigma$
Hence $\lambda = 1$ and the result follows.

Similarly we have:

$\dfrac 1 U = \dfrac Y X$
and again the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

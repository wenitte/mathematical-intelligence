Theorem
Every commutative semigroup containing cancellable elements admits an inverse completion.


Proof
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a commutative semigroup which has cancellable elements.

From Construction of Inverse Completion, we can construct an inverse completion $\struct {T', \oplus'}$ of $\struct {S', \oplus'}$, which is an isomorphic copy of $S$ under the mapping $\psi: S \to S'$.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: $\psi: S \to S'$ has not been definedYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.

By the Embedding Theorem, there exists a semigroup $\struct {T, \circ}$  which contains $\struct {S, \circ}$, and an isomorphism $\Psi$ from $\struct {T, \circ}$ to $\struct {T', \oplus'}$ which extends $\psi$.

Thus $T$ is an inverse completion of $S$.
$\blacksquare$

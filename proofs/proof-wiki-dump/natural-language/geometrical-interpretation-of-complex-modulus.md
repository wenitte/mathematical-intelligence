Theorem
Let $z \in \C$ be a complex number expressed in the complex plane.

Then the modulus of $z$ can be interpreted as the distance of $z$ from the origin.


Proof
Let $z = x + i y$.
By definition of the complex plane, it can be represented by the point $\tuple {x, y}$.
By the Distance Formula, the distance $d$ of $z$ from the origin is:














\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {\paren {x - 0}^2 + \paren {y - 0}^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {x^2 + y^2}\)









which is precisely the modulus of $z$.

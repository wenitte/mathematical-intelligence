Theorem
Let $T$ be a rooted tree with root node $r_T$.
Let $t$ be a leaf node of $T$.

Then there exists a unique branch $\Gamma$ of $T$ such that $t \in \Gamma$.


Proof
Let $t$ be on the branch $\Gamma$.
By definition of branch, $\Gamma$ is a path from the root node $r_T$ to $t$.
By Path in Tree is Unique, such $\Gamma$ is unique.
$\blacksquare$

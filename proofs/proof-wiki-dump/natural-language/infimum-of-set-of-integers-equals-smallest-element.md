Theorem
Let $S \subset \Z$ be a non-empty subset of the set of integers.
Let $S$ be bounded below in the set of real numbers $\R$.

Then $S$ has a smallest element, and it is equal to the infimum $\sup S$.


Proof
By Set of Integers Bounded Below by Real Number has Smallest Element, $S$ has a smallest element, say $n \in S$.
By Smallest Element is Infimum, $n$ is the infimum of $S$.
$\blacksquare$

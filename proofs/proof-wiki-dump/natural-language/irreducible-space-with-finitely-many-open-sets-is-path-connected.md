Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a irreducible topological space.
Let its topology $\tau$ be finite.

Then $T$ is path-connected.


Proof
Follows immediately from:

Irreducible Space with Finitely Many Open Sets has Generic Point
Topological Space with Generic Point is Path-Connected
$\blacksquare$

Irreducible Space is not necessarily Path-Connected

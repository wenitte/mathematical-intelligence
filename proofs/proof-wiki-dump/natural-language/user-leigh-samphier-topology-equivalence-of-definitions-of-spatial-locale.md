Therorem
Let $L = \struct{S, \preceq}$ be a locale.

The following definitions of the concept of Spatial Locale are equivalent:

Definition 1
$L$ is called a spatial locale if and only if $L$ is isomorphic to the locale of a topological space in the category of locales.


Definition 2
$L$ is called a spatial locale if and only if:
$\forall a, b \in L : a \npreceq b \implies \exists$ a frame homomorphism $p: L \to \mathbf 2 : \map p a = \top, \map p b = \bot$
where $\mathbf 2$ denotes the Boolean Latice $\struct{\mathbf 2, \lor, \land, \neg, \preceq}$.


Proof
$\blacksquare$

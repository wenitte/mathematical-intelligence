Theorem
Let $\LL$ be a straight line which intercepts the $x$-axis and $y$-axis respectively at $\tuple {a, 0}$ and $\tuple {0, b}$, where $a b \ne 0$.

Then $\LL$ can be described by the equation:

$\dfrac x a + \dfrac y b = 1$


Proof
By definition, $\LL$ passes through $\tuple {a, 0}$ and $\tuple {0, b}$.

From the Two-Point Form of Equation of Straight Line in Plane, $\LL$ can be expressed in the form:














\(\ds \dfrac {y - 0} {x - a}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {b - 0} {0 - a}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds -a y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b x - b a\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac x a + \dfrac y b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)









$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct{X, \tau}$ be a topological space.

If $T$ is paracompact then:

every open cover of $T$ has a locally finite refinement
Proof
Let $T$ be paracompact.

By definition of paracompact:

every open cover of $S$ has an open refinement which is locally finite.
By definition of open refinement:

every open refinement of a cover is a refinement of the cover.

It follows that:

every open cover of $T$ has a locally finite refinement.

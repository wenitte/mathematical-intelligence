Theorem
The trigonometric functions on the real numbers $\R$:

sine
cosine
tangent
cotangent
secant
cosecant
are all continuous at every point of their domain.


Proof
In turn:

Real Sine Function is Continuous
Real Cosine Function is Continuous
Real Tangent Function is Continuous
Real Cotangent Function is Continuous
Real Secant Function is Continuous
Real Cosecant Function is Continuous
$\blacksquare$

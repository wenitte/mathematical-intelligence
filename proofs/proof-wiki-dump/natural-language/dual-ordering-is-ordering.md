Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $\succeq$ denote the dual ordering of $\preceq$.

Then $\succeq$ is an ordering on $S$.


Proof
By definition of ordering, $\preceq$ is reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric.
By definition, $\succeq$ is the inverse relation to $\preceq$.
By Inverse of Reflexive Relation is Reflexive, $\succeq$ is reflexive.
By Inverse of Antisymmetric Relation is Antisymmetric, $\succeq$ is antisymmetric.
By Inverse of Transitive Relation is Transitive, $\succeq$ is transitive.
Thus by definition $\succeq$ is an ordering on $S$.
$\blacksquare$

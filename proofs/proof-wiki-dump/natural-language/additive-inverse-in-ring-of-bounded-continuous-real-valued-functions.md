Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $\struct {\map {C^*} {S, \R}, +, *}$ be the ring of bounded continuous real-valued functions from $S$.
Let $f \in \map {C^*} {S, \R}$.

Then:

the additive inverse of $f$ is the pointwise negation $-f$ defined by:
$\forall s \in S : \map {\paren{-f}} s = - \map f s$


Proof
Let $\struct{\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ be the ring of continuous real-valued functions from $S$.
From Ring of Bounded Continuous Functions is Subring of Continuous Real-Valued Functions:

$\struct{\map {C^*} {S, \R}, +, *}$ is a subring of $\struct{\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$
From Additive Inverse in Ring of Continuous Real-Valued Functions:

the additive inverse of $f$ in $\struct{\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ is the pointwise negation $-f$ defined by:
$\forall s \in S : \map {\paren{-f}} s = - \map f s$
From Inverses in Subgroup:

$-f$ is the additive inverse of $f$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
For any natural number $n \ge 1$, a closed and bounded subspace of the Euclidean space $\R^n$ is compact.


Proof
The proof holds for $n = 1$, as follows.
Suppose $C$ is a closed, bounded subspace of $\R$.
Then $C \subseteq \closedint a b$ for some $a, b \in \R$.
Moreover, $C$ is closed in $\closedint a b$ by the Corollary to Closed Set in Topological Subspace.
Hence $C$ is compact, by Closed Subspace of Compact Space is Compact.

Now suppose $C \subseteq \R^n$ is closed and bounded.
Since $C$ is bounded, $C \subseteq \closedint a b \times \closedint a b \times \cdots \times \closedint a b = B$ for some $a, b \in \R$.
Now $B$ is compact by Topological Product of Compact Spaces.
Also, $C$ is closed in $B$ by the Corollary to Closed Set in Topological Subspace.
Hence $C$ is compact, by Closed Subspace of Compact Space is Compact.
$\blacksquare$

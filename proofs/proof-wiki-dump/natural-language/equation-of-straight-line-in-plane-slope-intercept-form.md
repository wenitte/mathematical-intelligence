Theorem
Let $\LL$ be the straight line in the Cartesian plane such that:

the slope of $\LL$ is $m$
the $y$-intercept of $\LL$ is $c$

Then $\LL$ can be described by the equation:

$y = m x + c$

such that $m$ is the slope of $\LL$ and $c$ is the $y$-intercept.


Proof 1
Let $\LL$ be the straight line defined by the general equation:

$\alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 y = \beta$

We have:














\(\ds \alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \beta\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \alpha_2 y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y_1 - \alpha_1 x + \beta\)










\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac {\alpha_1} {\alpha_2} x + \dfrac {\beta} {\alpha_2}\)










Setting $x = 0$ we obtain:

$y = \dfrac {\beta} {\alpha_2}$
which is the $y$-intercept.
Differentiating $(1)$ with respect to $x$ gives:

$y' = -\dfrac {\alpha_1} {\alpha_2}$
By definition, this is the slope of $\LL$ and is seen to be constant.

The result follows by setting:














\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac {\alpha_1} {\alpha_2}\)




















\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\beta} {\alpha_2}\)









$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
By definition, the $y$-intercept of $\LL$ is $\tuple {0, c}$.
We calculate the $x$-intercept $X = \tuple {x_0, 0}$ of $\LL$:














\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {c - 0} {0 - x_0}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x_0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac c m\)










Hence from the two-intercept form of the Equation of straight line in the plane, $\LL$ can be described as:














\(\ds \dfrac x {-c / m} + \dfrac y c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)

\(\ds y\)

\(=\)

Proof 3

Let the straight line $\LL$  make an angle $\psi$ with the $x$-axis.
The slope $m$ of $\LL$ is then given by:

$m = \tan \psi$
Let $B := \tuple {0, c}$ be the $y$-intercept of $\LL$.
Let $P := \tuple {x, y}$ be an arbitrary point on $\LL$.
Let the perpendicular $MP$ to the $x$-axis be constructed from $P$ to intersect the $x$-axis at $M$
Let $BK$ be constructed perpendicular $MP$ from $B$ to intersect $MP$ at $K$.
Then we have:














\(\ds BK\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x\)





by construction














\(\ds KP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y - c\)





by construction














\(\ds KP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds BK \tan \psi\)





Definition of Tangent of Angle








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x \tan \psi + c\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds m x + c\)





Definition of $m$

Also presented as
The slope-intercept form of the equation of a straight line in the plane can also be seen presented as:

$y = x \tan \psi + c$
where $\psi$ is the angle that $\LL$ makes with the $x$-axis.


Also known as
The slope-intercept form of the equation of a straight line in the plane is also known as the gradient-intercept form.


Examples
Arbitrary Example
The straight line $\LL$ given by the equation:

$y = 2 x + 4$
has:

a slope of $2$, hence the angle between $\LL$ and the $x$-axis is $\arctan 2$
a $y$-intercept of $\tuple {0, 4}$.

Example of Algebraic Structure which is not a Group
Let $S = \set {1, 2, 3, 4}$.
Consider the algebraic structure $\struct {S, \circ}$ given by the Cayley table:

$\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
\circ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
\hline
1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4
\\
2 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 1
\\
3 & 3 & 2 & 4 & 3
\\
4 & 4 & 3 & 1 & 2
\\
\end{array}$
Then $\struct {S, \circ}$ is not a group.


Proof
It is immediately seen that $\struct {S, \circ}$ violates the Latin Square Property.
For example, both the column headed $3$ and the row headed $3$ have $2$ instances of $3$ in them.
$\blacksquare$

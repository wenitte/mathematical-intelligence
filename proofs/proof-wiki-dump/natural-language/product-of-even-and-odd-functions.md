Theorem
Let $\OO$ be an odd real function defined on some symmetric set $S$.
Let $\EE$ be an even real function defined on some symmetric set $S'$.
Let $\OO \EE$ be their pointwise product, defined on the intersection of the domains of $\OO$ and $\EE$.
Then $\OO \EE$ is odd. 

That is:

$\forall x \in S \cap S': \map {\paren {\OO \EE}} {-x} = - \map {\paren {\OO \EE} } x$.


Proof













\(\ds \map {\paren {\OO \EE} } {-x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map \OO {-x} \map \EE {-x}\)





Definition of Pointwise Multiplication of Real-Valued Functions














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\map \OO x \map \EE x\)





as $\OO$ is odd and $\EE$ is even














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\map {\paren {\OO \EE} } x\)









The result follows from the definition of an odd function.

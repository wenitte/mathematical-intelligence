Theorem
Let $M_1 = \struct {A_1, d_1}$ and $M_2 = \struct {A_2, d_2}$ be metric spaces.
Let $\tau_{d_1}$ and $\tau_{d_2}$ be the topologies induced by the metrics $d_1$ and $d_2$.
Let $T_1 = \struct {A_1, \tau_{d_1} }$ and $T_2 = \struct {A_2, \tau_{d_2} }$ be the resulting topological spaces.
Let $f: A_1 \to A_2$ be a mapping.

Then $f$ is $\tuple {d_1, d_2}$-continuous if and only if $f$ is $\tuple {\tau_{d_1}, \tau_{d_2} }$-continuous.


Proof
Follows directly from:

the open set definition of continuity on a metric space
the definition of continuity on a topological space.

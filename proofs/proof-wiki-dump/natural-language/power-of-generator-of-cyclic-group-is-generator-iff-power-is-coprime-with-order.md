Theorem
Let $C_n$ be the cyclic group of order $n$.
Let $C_n = \gen a$, that is, that $C_n$ is generated by $a$.

Then:

$C_n = \gen {a^k} \iff k \perp n$
That is, $C_n$ is also generated by $a^k$ if and only if $k$ is coprime to $n$.


Proof
Necessary Condition
Let $k \perp n$.
Then by Integer Combination of Coprime Integers:

$\exists u, v \in \Z: 1 = u k + v n$
So $\forall m \in \Z$, we have:














\(\ds a^m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{m \paren 1}\)





Integer Multiplication Identity is One














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{m \paren {u k + v n} }\)





as shown above














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{m \paren {u k} + m v n}\)





Integer Multiplication Distributes over Addition














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{m \paren {u k} } a^{m v n}\)





Product of Powers














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{m \paren {u k} } e\)





as $a^{m v n} = e$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{m \paren {u k} }\)





Definition of Identity Element














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{\paren {m u} k}\)





Integer Multiplication is Associative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{k \paren {m u} }\)





Integer Multiplication is Commutative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a^k}^{m u}\)





Power of Power



Thus $a^k$ generate $C_n$.

Although this article appears correct, it's inelegant. There has to be a better way of doing it.In particular: Do we really need all the above clutter? The arithmetic properties of the integers are really not under the microscope here -- is it really necessary to go blow by blow through all this?You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by redesigning it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Improve}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.


Sufficient Condition
Let $C_n = \gen {a^k}$.
That is, let $a^k$ generate $C_n$.










\(\ds \exists u \in \Z: \, \)



\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a^k}^u\)





as $a$ is an element of the group generated by $a^k$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds u k\)

\(\equiv\)







\(\ds 1\)

\(\ds \pmod n\)












\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)

\(\ds \exists u, v \in \Z: \, \)



\(\ds 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds u k + v n\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds k\)

Theorem
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$ be a (strictly) positive integer.
Let $U_n = \set {z \in \C: z^n = 1}$ be the set of complex $n$th roots of unity.

Then $1 \in U_n$.

That is, $1$ is always one of the complex $n$th roots of unity of any $n$.


Proof
By definition of integer power:

$1^n = 1$
for all $n$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

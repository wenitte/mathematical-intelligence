Theorem
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$ be a positive integer which is the product of $2$ distinct primes.

Then $n$ has exactly $4$ positive divisors.


Proof
Let $n = p \times q$ where $p$ and $q$ are primes.

We have by definition of divisor:














\(\ds 1\)

\(\divides\)







\(\ds n\)





One Divides all Integers














\(\ds p\)

\(\divides\)







\(\ds n\)





Definition of Divisor of Integer














\(\ds q\)

\(\divides\)







\(\ds n\)





Definition of Divisor of Integer














\(\ds p \times q\)

\(\divides\)







\(\ds n\)





Integer Divides Itself



where $\divides$ denotes divisibility.

Suppose $a \divides n$ such that $1 \le a < n$.
Suppose $a \ne p$.
By definition of prime number:

$a \perp p$
where $\perp$ denotes coprimality.
From Euclid's Lemma:

$a \divides q$
and so by definition of prime number:

$a = q$
or:

$a = 1$
Similarly, suppose $a \ne q$.
By the same reasoning:

$a = p$
or:

$a = 1$
Thus the only positive divisors are as above.

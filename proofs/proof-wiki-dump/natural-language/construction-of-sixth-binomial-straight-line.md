Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

To find the sixth binomial straight line.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $53$)


Proof

Let $AC$ and $CB$ be straight lines constructed such that $AB = AC + CB$ is itself a straight line.
Let neither $AB : AC$ nor $AB : BC$ be the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Let $D$ be a number which is not square.
Let $D$ have to neither $AB$ nor $AC$ the ratio that a square number has to another square number.

Let $E$ be a rational straight line.
Using Porism to Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{X} $: Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable, let:

$D : AB = E^2 : FG^2$
where $FG$ is a straight line.
From Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{X} $: Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable:

$E^2$ is commensurable with $FG^2$.
We have that $E$ is rational.
Therefore $FG$ is also rational.
Since:

$D$ does not have to $AB$ the ratio that a square number has to another square number
then:

$E^2$ does not have to $FG^2$ the ratio that a square number has to another square number.
From Proposition $9$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Squares:

$E$ is incommensurable in length with $FG$.

Using Porism to Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{X} $: Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable, let:

$BA : AC = FG^2 : GH^2$
where $GH$ is a straight line constructed such that $FH = FG + GH$ is itself a straight line.
From Proposition $6$ of Book $\text{X} $: Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable:

$FG^2$ is commensurable with $GH^2$.
We have that $FG$ is rational.
Therefore $GH$ is also rational.
Since:

$BA$ does not have to $AC$ the ratio that a square number has to another square number
then:

$FG^2$ does not have to $GH^2$ the ratio that a square number has to another square number.
From Proposition $9$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Squares:

$FG$ is incommensurable in length with $GH$.
Therefore $FG$ and $GH$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Therefore by definition $FH$ is a binomial.

We have that:

$D : AB = E^2 : FG^2$
and

$BA : AC = FG^2 : GH^2$
From Proposition $22$ of Book $\text{V} $: Equality of Ratios Ex Aequali:

$D : AC = E^2 : GH^2$
But $D$ does not have to $AC$ the ratio that a square number has to another square number.
Therefore, neither does $E$ have to $GH$ the ratio that a square number has to another square number.
Therefore from Proposition $9$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Squares:

$E$ is incommensurable in length with $GH$.
We have that:

$BA : AC = FG^2 : GH^2$
Therefore:

$FG^2 > GH^2$
Let:

$FG^2 = GH^2 + K^2$
for some $K$.
From Porism to Proposition $19$ of Book $\text{V} $: Proportional Magnitudes have Proportional Remainders:

$AB : BC = FG : K$
But $AB$ does not have to $AC$ the ratio that a square number has to another square number.
Therefore, neither does $FG^2$ have to $k^2$ the ratio that a square number has to another square number.
Therefore from Proposition $9$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Squares:

$FG$ is incommensurable in length with $K$.
Therefore $FG^2$ is greater than $GH^2$ by the square on a straight line which is incommensurable in length with $FG$.
But $FG$ and $GH$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Also, neither $FG$ nor $GH$ is commensurable in length with $E$.
Therefore $FH$ is a sixth binomial straight line.

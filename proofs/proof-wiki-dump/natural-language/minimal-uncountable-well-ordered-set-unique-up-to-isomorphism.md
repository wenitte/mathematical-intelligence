Theorem
Let $\Omega, \Omega'$ be minimal uncountable well-ordered sets.

Then $\Omega$ is order isomorphic to $\Omega'$.
That is, the minimal uncountable well-ordered set is unique up to order isomorphism.


Proof
From Wosets are Isomorphic to Each Other or Initial Segments, precisely one of the following holds:

$\Omega$ is order isomorphic to $\Omega'$
or:

$\Omega$ is order isomorphic to an initial segment in $\Omega'$
or:

$\Omega'$ is order isomorphic to an initial segment in $\Omega$.

By the definition of minimal uncountable well-ordered set, $\Omega$ and $\Omega'$ are uncountable.
The initial segments of $\Omega$ and $\Omega'$ are countable.
An uncountable set cannot be order isomorphic to a countable set.

Thus $\Omega$ must be order isomorphic to $\Omega'$.
The result follows from the definition of uniqueness.

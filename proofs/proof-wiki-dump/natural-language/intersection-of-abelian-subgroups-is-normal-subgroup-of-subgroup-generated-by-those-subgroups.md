Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $L$ and $M$ be abelian subgroups of $G$.
Let $H = \gen {L, M}$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by $L$ and $M$.

Then $L \cap M$ is a normal subgroup of $H$.


Proof
From 
We have that $L$ and $M$ are abelian.
From Intersection of Subgroups is Subgroup, we have that $L \cap M$ is a subgroup of both $L$ and $M$.
From Subgroup of Abelian Group is Normal, we also have that $L \cap M$ is a normal subgroup of both $L$ and $M$.
Thus from Normalizer of Subgroup is Largest Subgroup containing that Subgroup as Normal Subgroup:

$L \subseteq \map N {L \cap M}$
and:

$M \subseteq \map N {L \cap M}$
Hence:

$L \cup M \subseteq \map N {L \cap M}$
But from Normalizer is Subgroup, $\map N {L \cap M}$ is a subgroup of $G$.
So it follows that:

$H \subseteq \map N {L \cap M}$
Hence the result by Subgroup is Normal Subgroup of Normalizer.

Theorem
Let $L = \struct{S, \preceq}$ be a spatial locale.

Let $\operatorname {Sp_*} : \mathbf {Loc_*} \to \mathbf {Top}$ denote the localic spectrum functor.
Let $\mathbf {Lc} : \mathbf {Top} \to \mathbf {Loc_*}$ denote the localic functor.

Then:

$\map {\mathbf {Lc}} {\map {\operatorname {Sp_*}} L}$ is isomorphic to $L$ in $\mathbf {Loc_*}$


Proof
$\blacksquare$

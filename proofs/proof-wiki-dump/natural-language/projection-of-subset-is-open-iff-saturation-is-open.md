Theorem
Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on a topological space $X$.
Let $X / \sim$ be the quotient space.
Let $p$ denote the quotient mapping.
Let $U \subset X$.

Then the following are equivalent:

$\map p U$ is open in $X / \sim$
The saturation of $U$ is open in $X$


Proof
By definition of quotient topology, $\map p U$ is open in $X / \sim$ if and only if $\map {p^{-1} } {\map p U}$ is open in $X$.
$\blacksquare$

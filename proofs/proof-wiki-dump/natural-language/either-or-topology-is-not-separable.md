Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be the either-or space.

Then $T$ is not a separable space.


Proof
From Limit Points of Either-Or Topology, the only limit point of any set of $S$ is $0$.
So the only set whose closure is $S$ are $S \setminus \set 0$ and $S$ itself.
So these two are the only subsets of $S$ which are everywhere dense in $S$.
Both of these are uncountable.
Hence the result, by definition of separable space.
$\blacksquare$

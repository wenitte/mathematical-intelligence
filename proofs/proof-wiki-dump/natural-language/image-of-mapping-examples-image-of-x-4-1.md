Example of Image of Element under Mapping
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be the mapping defined as:

$\forall x \in \R: \map f x = x^4 - 1$
The image of $f$ is the unbounded closed interval:

$\Img f = \hointr {-1} \to$
and so $f$ is not a surjection.


Proof
Trivially, by differentiating $x^4 - 1$ with respect to $x$:

$f' = 4 x^3$
and equating $f'$ to $0$, the minimum of $\Img f$ is seen to occur at $f \paren 0 = -1$.
Thus it can be seen that the minimum of $\Img f$ is $-1$.
As $f$ is strictly increasing on $x > 0$ and strictly decreasing on $x < 0$, it is seen that $f$ is unbounded above.
Thus:

$\Img f = \hointr {-1} \to$
As $\Img f \subset \R$ and $\Img f \ne \R$, it follows by definition that $f$ is not surjective.
$\blacksquare$

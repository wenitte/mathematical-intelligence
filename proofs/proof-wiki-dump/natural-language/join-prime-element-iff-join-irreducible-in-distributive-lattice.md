Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a distributive lattice.
Let $z \in S$.

Then:

$z$ is join-irreducible
if and only if

$z$ is join-prime
Proof
By Dual Pairs (Order Theory):

join prime element is dual to meet prime element.
join irreducible element is dual to meet irreducible element.
Thus the theorem holds by the duality principle applied to Characterization of Meet Irreducible Element.

Theorem
The intersection of two sets is a subset of their union:

$S \cap T \subseteq S \cup T$


Proof













\(\ds S \cap T\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds S\)





Intersection is Subset














\(\ds S\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds S \cup T\)





Set is Subset of Union








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds S \cap T\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds S \cup T\)





Subset Relation is Transitive



$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$\exp 0 = 1$


Proof
This proof assumes the power series definition of $\exp$.
That is, let:

$\ds \exp x = \sum_{k \mathop = 0}^\infty \frac {x^k} {k!}$

Then:














\(\ds \exp 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sum_{k \mathop = 0}^\infty \frac {0^k} {k!}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)

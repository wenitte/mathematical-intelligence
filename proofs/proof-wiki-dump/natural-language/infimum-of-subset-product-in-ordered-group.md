Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ, \preceq}$ be an ordered group.
Let subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G$ admit infima in $G$.

Then:

$\map \inf {A \circ_\PP B} = \inf A \circ \inf B$
where $\circ_\PP$ denotes subset product.


Proof
This follows from Supremum of Subset Product in Ordered Group and the Duality Principle.
$\blacksquare$

Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
Arise, work-women, it is past dawn;
a fifth part of three-eighths of what remains is gone by.


Solution
Let $t$ be the time in hours since dawn.
It is assumed that the day is $12$ hours long.

We have:














\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 5 \times \dfrac 3 8 \paren {12 - t}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 40 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 36 - 3 t\)





multiplying through by $40$ to clear the fractions








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 43 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 36\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {36} {43}\)










So $\dfrac {36} {43}$ of an hour has passed since dawn.
$\blacksquare$

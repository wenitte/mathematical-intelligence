Theorem
  
Let $B$ be a body under constant acceleration $\mathbf a$.
Then:

$\mathbf s = \mathbf u t + \dfrac {\mathbf a t^2} 2$

where:

$\mathbf s$ is the displacement of $B$ from its initial position at time $t$
$\mathbf u$ is the velocity at time $t = 0$.


Proof
From Body under Constant Acceleration: Velocity after Time:

$\mathbf v = \mathbf u + \mathbf a t$
By definition of velocity, this can be expressed as:

$\dfrac {\d \mathbf s} {\d t} = \mathbf u + \mathbf a t$
where both $\mathbf u$ and $\mathbf a$ are constant.
By Solution to Linear First Order Ordinary Differential Equation:

$\mathbf s = \mathbf c + \mathbf u t + \dfrac {\mathbf a t^2} 2$
where $\mathbf c$ is a constant vector.
We are (implicitly) given the initial condition:

$\bigvalueat {\mathbf s} {t \mathop = 0} = \mathbf 0$
from which it follows immediately that:

$\mathbf s = \mathbf u t + \dfrac {\mathbf a t^2} 2$
$\blacksquare$


Also presented as
Some sources present Body under Constant Acceleration: Distance after Time in the form:

$\mathbf s = \mathbf s_0 + \mathbf v_0 t + \dfrac {\mathbf a t^2} 2$
where:

$\mathbf s_0$ is the displacement of $B$ at time $t = 0$
$\mathbf v_0$ is the velocity of $B$ at time $t = 0$.

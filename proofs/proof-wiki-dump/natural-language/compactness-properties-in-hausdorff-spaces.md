Theorem
Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be compactness properties and let:

$P_1 \implies P_2$
mean:

If a $T_2$ (Hausdorff) space $T$ satsifies property $P_1$, then $T$ also satisfies property $P_2$.

Then the following sequence of implications holds:





Fully $T_4$


$\iff$


Paracompact









$\Big\Downarrow$



Weakly $\sigma$-Locally Compact


$\implies$


$T_4$



$\Big\Downarrow$





$\Big\Downarrow$



Weakly Locally Compact


$\implies$


$T_{3 \frac 1 2}$









$\Big\Downarrow$



First-Countable and Countably Compact


$\implies$


$T_3$




Proof
From $T_2$ Space is $T_1$ Space and $T_1$ Space is $T_0$ Space, we note that in a $T_2$ (Hausdorff) space:

A fully $T_4$ space is a fully normal space
A $T_4$ space is a normal space
A $T_{3 \frac 1 2}$ space is a Tychonoff space
A $T_3$ space is a regular space
all by definition.

From Hausdorff Space is Fully $T_4$ iff Paracompact we have that:

Fully $T_4$ $\iff$ Paracompact.
From that same result and Fully $T_4$ Space is $T_4$ Space:

Paracompact $\implies$ $T_4$

From Normal Space is Tychonoff Space it follows that:

$T_4$ $\implies$ $T_{3 \frac 1 2}$
From First-Countable Space is Sequentially Compact iff Countably Compact and Sequentially Compact Hausdorff Space is Regular it follows that:

First-Countable and Countably Compact $\implies$ $T_3$

The further justifications are listed as follows:

$\sigma$-Locally Compact Hausdorff Space is $T_4$
Weakly $\sigma$-Locally Compact implies Weakly Locally Compact by definition.
$T_{3 \frac 1 2}$ Space is $T_3$ Space

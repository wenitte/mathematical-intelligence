Example of Problem from Chiu Chang Suann Jing
Two and a half piculs of rice are bought for $\frac 3 7$ of a tael of silver.
How many piculs of rice can be bought for $9$ taels?


Answer
Let $x$ be the required quantity.

$\dfrac x 9$ piculs can be bought with $1$ tael.
Hence $\dfrac x 9 \times \dfrac 3 7$ can be bought for $\dfrac 3 7$ of a tael.
That is:

$\dfrac x 9 \times \dfrac 3 7 = \dfrac 5 2$
and so:

$x = 9 \times \dfrac 5 2 / \dfrac 3 7 = 52 \frac 1 2$
$\blacksquare$

One picul, apparently, is equal to about $65$ kilograms.

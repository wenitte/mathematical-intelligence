Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \vee, \preceq}$ be a join semilattice.
Let $z \in S$.

Then:

$z$ is join-irreducible
if and only if

$\forall x, y \in SÂ : \leftparen{x \prec z}$ and $\rightparen{y \prec z} \implies \paren{x \vee y \prec z}$
where $x \prec z$ denotes that $x \preceq z$ and $x \neq z$. 

Proof
By Dual Pairs (Order Theory):

join semilattice is dual to meet semilattice.
join irreducible element is dual to meet irreducible element.
join is dual to meet.
succeeds is dual to precedes.
Thus the theorem holds by the duality principle applied to Characterization of Meet Irreducible Element.

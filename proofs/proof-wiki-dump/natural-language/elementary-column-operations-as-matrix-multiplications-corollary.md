Theorem
Let $\mathbf X$ and $\mathbf Y$ be two $m \times n$ matrices that differ by exactly one elementary column operation.
Then there exists an elementary column matrix $\mathbf E$ of order $n$ such that:

$\mathbf X \mathbf E = \mathbf Y$


Proof
Let $e$ be the elementary column operation such that $e \paren {\mathbf X} = \mathbf Y$.
Then this result follows immediately from Elementary Column Operations as Matrix Multiplications:

$e \paren {\mathbf X} = \mathbf X \mathbf E = \mathbf Y$
where $\mathbf E = e \paren {\mathbf I}$.
$\blacksquare$

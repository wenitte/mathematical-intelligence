Theorem
Let $\struct {R, \norm{\,\cdot\,} }$ be a normed division ring.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$, $\sequence {y_n}$ be Cauchy sequences in $R$.
Let $a, b \in R$.
Then:

$\sequence {a x_n + b y_n }$ is a Cauchy sequence.


Proof
From the Multiple Rule for Normed Division Ring Sequences:

$\sequence {a x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence
$\sequence {b y_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.
The result now follows directly from the Sum Rule for Normed Division Ring Sequences:

$\sequence {a x_n + b y_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.
$\blacksquare$

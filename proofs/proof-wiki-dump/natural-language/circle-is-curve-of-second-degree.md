Theorem
The circle is a curve of degree $2$.


Proof
From Equation of Circle in Cartesian Plane, a circle can be expressed in the form:

$x^2 + y^2 - 2 a x - 2 b y + a^2 + b^2 - R^2 = 0$
where $\tuple {a, b}$ is the center and $R$ is the radius.

This is a quadratic equation in $2$ variables.
Hence the result by definition of degree of curve.
$\blacksquare$


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Sommerville is not rigorous about defining exactly what the degree of a curve is, so the definition needs to wait until such time as I can hunt it down from another source.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.

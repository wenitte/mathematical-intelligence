Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a particular point space.
Let $\sequence {a_i}$ be an infinite sequence in $T$.
Let $\beta$ be an accumulation point of $\sequence {a_i}$.

Then $\beta$ is such that an infinite number of terms of $\sequence {a_i}$ are equal either to $\beta$ or to $p$.


Proof
Let $\beta$ be an accumulation point of $\sequence {a_i}$.
Then by definition:

all open sets of $T$ which contain $\beta$ also contain an infinite number of terms of $\sequence {a_i}$.
This condition applies to the open set $\set {\beta, p}$.
So $\set {\beta, p}$ contains an infinite number of terms of $\sequence {a_i}$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

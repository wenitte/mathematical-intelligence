Theorem
Let $a$ be a non-zero algebraic number (possibly complex).
Then:

$e^a$ is transcendental
where $e$ is Euler's number.


Corollary
Let $a$ be a algebraic number (possibly complex) which is neither $0$ nor $1$.
Then:

any value of $\ln a$ is transcendental
where $\ln$ denotes complex natural logarithm.


Proof
This follows trivially from Hermite-Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem by taking $n = 1$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $x$ and $y$ be proportional.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Establish what types of object $x$ and $y$ are. As it stands here, they could be anything.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Let $n \in \Z$. 

Then $x^n \propto y^n$.


Proof
Let $x \propto y$.
Then $\exists k \ne 0: x = k \times y$ by the definition of proportion.
Raising both sides of this equation to the $n$th power:














\(\ds x^n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {k \times y}^n\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds k^n \times y^n\)









so $k^n$ is the desired constant of proportion.
The result follows from the definition of proportion.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If a straight line touch a circle, and a straight line joined from the center to the point of contact, the straight line so joined will be perpendicular to the tangent.
(The Elements: Book $\text{III}$: Proposition $18$)


Proof

Let $DE$ be tangent to the circle $ABC$ at $C$.
Let $F$ be the center of $ABC$.
Let $FC$ be the radius in question.

Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $FC$ were not perpendicular to $DE$.
Instead, suppose $FG$ were drawn perpendicular to $DE$.
Since $\angle FGC$ is a right angle, then from Two Angles of Triangle are Less than Two Right Angles it follows that $\angle FCG$ is acute.
From Greater Angle of Triangle Subtended by Greater Side it follows that $FC > FG$.
But $FC = FB$ and so $FB > FG$, which is impossible.
So $FG$ can not be perpendicular to $DE$.
Similarly it can be proved that no other straight line except $FC$ can be perpendicular to $DE$.
Therefore $FC$ is perpendicular to $DE$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $18$ of Book $\text{III}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $19$: Right Angle to Tangent of Circle goes through Center.

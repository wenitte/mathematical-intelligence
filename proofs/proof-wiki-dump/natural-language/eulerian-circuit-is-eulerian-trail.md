Theorem
Let $G$ be a graph.
Let $C$ be an Eulerian circuit for $G$.
Then $C$ is also an Eulerian trail for $G$. 


Proof
Recall the definition of Eulerian circuit:
An Eulerian circuit is a circuit that passes through every vertex of a graph and uses every edge exactly once.

Recall the definition of Eulerian trail:
An Eulerian trail is a trail $T$ that passes through every vertex of a graph $G$ and uses every edge of $G$ exactly once.

Recall the definition of circuit:
A circuit is a closed trail with at least one edge.

Hence an Eulerian circuit is an instance of an Eulerian trail.

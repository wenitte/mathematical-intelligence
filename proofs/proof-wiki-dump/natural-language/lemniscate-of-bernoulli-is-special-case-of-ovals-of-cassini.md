Theorem
The lemniscate of Bernoulli is a special case of the ovals of Cassini.


Proof from Geometric Definition
The ovals of Cassini are defined as follows:

Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be points in the plane such that $P_1 P_2 = 2 a$ for some constant $a$.
The ovals of Cassini are the loci of points $M$ in the plane such that:

$P_1 M \times P_2 M = b^2$
for a real constant $b$.

The lemniscate of Bernoulli is defined geometrically as:

Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be points in the plane such that $P_1 P_2 = 2 a$ for some constant $a$.
The lemniscate of Bernoulli is the locus of points $M$ in the plane such that:

$P_1 M \times P_2 M = a^2$

It follows that the lemniscate of Bernoulli is an oval of Cassini where $b = a$.

Proof from Cartesian Definition
The ovals of Cassini can be defined by a Cartesian equation as follows:

The Cartesian equation:

$\paren {x^2 + y^2 + a^2}^2 - 4 a^2 x^2 = b^4$
describes the ovals of Cassini.

The lemniscate of Bernoulli can be defined by a Cartesian equation as follows:

The lemniscate of Bernoulli is the curve defined by the Cartesian equation:

$\paren {x^2 + y^2}^2 = 2 a^2 \paren {x^2 - y^2}$

Setting $b = a$:














\(\ds \paren {x^2 + y^2 + a^2}^2 - 4 a^2 x^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^4\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {x^2 + y^2}^2 + 2 \paren {x^2 + y^2} a^2 + a^4 - 4 a^2 x^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^4\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {x^2 + y^2}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 a^2 x^2 - 2 a^2 x^2 - 2 a^2 y^2\)





simplifying and rearranging














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 a^2 \paren {x^2 - y^2}\)





further simplification



It follows that the lemniscate of Bernoulli is an oval of Cassini where $b = a$.
$\blacksquare$


Proof from Polar Definition
The ovals of Cassini can be defined by a polar equation as follows:

The polar equation:

$r^4 + a^4 - 2 a^2 r^2 \cos 2 \theta = b^4$
describes the ovals of Cassini.

The lemniscate of Bernoulli can be defined by a polar equation as follows:

The lemniscate of Bernoulli is the curve defined by the polar equation:

$r^2 = 2 a^2 \cos 2 \theta$

Setting $b = a$:














\(\ds r^4 + a^4 - 2 a^2 r^2 \cos 2 \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^4\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds r^4 - 2 a^2 r^2 \cos 2 \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds r^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 a^2 \cos 2 \theta\)





simplifying and rearranging



It follows that the lemniscate of Bernoulli is an oval of Cassini where $b = a$.

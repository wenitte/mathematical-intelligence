Theorem
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$ be a positive integer which is the product of $2$ distinct primes.

Then $n$ is multiplicatively perfect.


Proof
Let $n = p \times q$ where $p$ and $q$ are primes.
From Product of Two Distinct Primes has 4 Positive Divisors, the positive divisors of $n$ are:

$1, p, q, pq$
Thus the product of all the divisors of $n$ is:

$1 \times p \times q \times p q = p^2 q^2 = n^2$
Hence the result, by definition of multiplicatively perfect.
$\blacksquare$

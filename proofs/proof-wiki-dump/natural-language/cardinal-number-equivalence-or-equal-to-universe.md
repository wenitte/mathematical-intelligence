Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\card S$ denote the cardinal number of $S$.
Let $\mathbb U$ denote the universal class.

Then:

$S \sim \card S \lor \card S = \mathbb U$


Proof
By Condition for Set Equivalent to Cardinal Number:
If $\exists x \in \On: S \sim x$, then:

$S \sim \card S$

If $\neg \exists x \in \On: S \sim x$, then:














\(\ds \bigcap \set {x \in \On : S \sim x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \bigcap \O\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \mathbb U\)





Intersection of Empty Set



And thus by the definition of cardinal number:

$\card S = \mathbb U$
$\blacksquare$

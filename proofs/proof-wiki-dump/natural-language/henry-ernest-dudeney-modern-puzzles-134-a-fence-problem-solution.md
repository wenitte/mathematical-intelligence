Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $134$
A Fence Problem
A man has a square field, $60 \ \mathrm {ft.}$ by $60 \ \mathrm {ft.}$, with other property, adjoining the highway.
For some reason he put up a straight fence in the line of three trees, as shown,
and the length of fence from the middle tree to the tree on the road was just $91$ feet.

What is the distance in exact feet from the middle tree to the gate on the road?


Solution
$35$ feet.


Proof

Let $x$ be the distance required.
Let $y$ be the distance marked on the diagram.
We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds x^2 + y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 91^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \dfrac x y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {60} {60 + y}\)





Definition of Similar Triangles








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {60 x} {60 - x}\)





rearranging $2$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2 + \paren {\dfrac {60 x} {60 - x} }^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 91^2\)





substituting for $y$ in $(1)$



The above leads to a quartic equation which is irksome to solve.

However, we are told that $x$ is an exact number of feet.
We have that $91^2$ is the sum of two square numbers in exactly one way:














\(\ds 91^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8281\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7056 + 1225\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7056 + 1225\)





that is: $84^2 + 35^2$



Inserting $x = 35$ and $y = 84$ into $2$ proves that these numbers are consistent with the premises.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

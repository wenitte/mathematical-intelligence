Theorem
Let $M$ be a Möbius Strip.

Then:

$\map \chi M = 0$
where $\map \chi M$ denotes the Euler characteristic of the graph $M$.


Proof
Let the number of vertices, edges and faces of $M$ be $V$, $E$ and $F$ respectively.
From Möbius Strip has no Vertices:

$V = 0$
From Möbius Strip has 1 Edge:

$E = 1$
From Möbius Strip has 1 Face:

$F = 1$
By definition of the Euler characteristic:














\(\ds \map \chi M\)

\(=\)







\(\ds V - E + F\)





Definition of Euler Characteristic














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0 - 1 + 1\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)

Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space.
Let $M$ be countably compact.

Then $M$ is compact.


Proof
We have that a Metric Space is Countably Compact iff Sequentially Compact.
Then we have that a Sequentially Compact Metric Space is Separable.
For each $n$, a metric space which is countably compact can be covered by finitely many open $\paren {1/n}$-balls: $\map {B_{1/n} } {x_i}$.

So $\set {x_i}$ is a dense subset of $A$ which is countable.
So if a metric space is countably compact it is by definition second-countable.

The result follows from Second-Countable Space is Compact iff Countably Compact.

Axiom of Countable Choice
This theorem depends on the Axiom of Countable Choice, by way of Sequentially Compact Metric Space is Separable.
Although not as strong as the Axiom of Choice, the Axiom of Countable Choice is similarly independent of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms.
As such, mathematicians are generally convinced of its truth and believe that it should be generally accepted.

Theorem
Let $G$ be a group whose identity is $e$.
Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.
Let $g_1, g_2 \in G$.

Then:

$H g_1 = H g_2 \iff {g_1}^{-1} H = {g_2}^{-1} H$
where:

${g_1}^{-1}$ and ${g_2}^{-1}$ denote the inverses of $g_1$ and $g_2$ in $G$
$H g_1$ and $H g_2$ denote the right cosets of $H$ by $g_1$ and $g_2$ respectively
${g_1}^{-1} H$ and ${g_2}^{-1} H$ denote the left cosets of $H$ by ${g_1}^{-1}$ and ${g_2}^{-1}$ respectively.


Proof













\(\ds H g_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds H g_2\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds g_1 {g_2}^{-1}\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds H\)





Right Cosets are Equal iff Product with Inverse in Subgroup








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren { {g_1}^{-1} }^{-1} {g_2}^{-1}\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds H\)





Inverse of Group Inverse








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds {g_1}^{-1} H\)

\(=\)







\(\ds {g_2}^{-1} H\)





Left Cosets are Equal iff Product with Inverse in Subgroup

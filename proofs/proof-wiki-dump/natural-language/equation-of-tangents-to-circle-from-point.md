Theorem
Let $\CC$ be a circle embedded in the Cartesian plane of radius $r$ with its center located at the origin.
Let $P = \tuple {x_0, y_0}$ be a point in the plane of $\CC$ which is outside $\CC$.

The tangents to $\CC$ which pass through $P$ can be described using the equation:

$\paren {x x_0 + y y_0 - r^2}^2 = \paren {x^2 + y^2 - r^2} \paren { {x_0}^2 + {y_0}^2 - r^2}$


Proof
From Equation of Circle center Origin, $\CC$ can be described as:

$x^2 + y^2 = r^2$
Let $\LL$ be an arbitrary straight line through $P$ which intersects $\CC$ at $U$ and $V$.
Let $Q = \tuple{x, y}$ be an arbitrary point on $\LL$.

Let $k$ be the position-ratio of one of the points $U$ and $V$ with respect to $P$ and $Q$.
By Joachimsthal's equation:

$(1): \quad k^2 \paren {x^2 + y^2 - r^2} + 2 k \paren {x x_0 + y y_0 - r^2} + \paren { {x_0}^2 + {y_0}^2 - r^2} = 0$
which is a quadratic in $k$.

When $\LL$ is tangent to $\CC$, the points $U$ and $V$ coincide.
Hence $(1)$ has equal roots.
From Solution to Quadratic Equation, it follows that the discriminant of $(1)$ is zero.
That is:

$\paren {x x_0 + y y_0 - r^2}^2 - \paren {x^2 + y^2 - r^2} \paren { {x_0}^2 + {y_0}^2 - r^2} = 0$
$\blacksquare$

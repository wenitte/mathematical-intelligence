Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $239$
The Bell Rope
A bell rope, passing through the ceiling above, just touches the belfry floor,
and when you pull the rope to the wall, keeping the rope taut, it touches a point just $3$ inches above the floor,
and the wall was $4$ feet from the rope, when it hung at rest.
How long was the rope from floor to ceiling?


Solution
$32$ feet and $1 \tfrac 1 2$ inches.


Proof
Let $L$ inches be the length of the bell-rope.
Thus we have described a right triangle:

whose legs are $4 \times 12 = 48$ and $L - 3$ (as there are $12$ inches to the foot)
and whose hypotenuse is $L$.
Thus:














\(\ds \paren {L - 3}^2 + 48^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds L^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds L^2 - 6 L + 9 + 2304\)

\(=\)







\(\ds L^2\)





multiplying out








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {2313} 6\)





simpliication














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 385 \tfrac 1 2\)





simpliication



The result follows on converting $385 \tfrac 1 2$ inches to feet and inches.

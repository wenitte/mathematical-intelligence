Example of Number of Regions in Plane Defined by Given Number of Lines
With $6$ lines, the plane can be divided into a maximum of $22$ regions:





Proof
From Number of Regions in Plane Defined by Given Number of Lines, the maximum number $L_n$ of regions in the plane that can be defined by $n$ straight lines in the plane is:

$L_n = \dfrac {n \paren {n + 1} } 2 + 1$
Here $n = 6$, so:














\(\ds L_6\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {6 \paren {6 + 1} } 2 + 1\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {6 \times 7} 2 + 1\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 22\)

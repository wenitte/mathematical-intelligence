Theorem
Let $n$ be a perfect number.
Let $m$ be a positive integer such that $m > 1$.

Then $m n$ is abundant.


Proof
We have by definition of divisor sum function and perfect number that:

$\dfrac {\map {\sigma_1} n} n = 2$
But from Abundancy Index of Product is greater than Abundancy Index of Proper Factors:

$\dfrac {\map {\sigma_1} {m n} } {m n} > 2$
Hence the result by definition of abundant.
$\blacksquare$

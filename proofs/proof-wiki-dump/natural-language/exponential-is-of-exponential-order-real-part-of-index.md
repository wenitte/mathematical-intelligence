Theorem
Let $\map f t = e^{\psi t}$ be the complex exponential function, where $t \in \R, \psi \in \C$.
Let $a = \map \Re \psi$.

Then $e^{\psi t}$ is of exponential order $a$.


Proof









\(\ds \forall t \ge 1: \, \)



\(\ds \size {e^{\psi t} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^{a t}\)





Modulus of Exponential is Exponential of Real Part














\(\ds \)

\(<\)







\(\ds 2 e^{a t}\)





Exponential of Real Number is Strictly Positive



The result follows from the definition of exponential order with $M = 1$, $K = 2$, and $a = a$.

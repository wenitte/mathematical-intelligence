Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_{a, b} }$ be a modified Fort space.

Then $T$ is not totally separated.


Proof
We have:

Totally Separated Space is Completely Hausdorff and Urysohn
Completely Hausdorff Space is Hausdorff Space
But we have:

Modified Fort Space is not Hausdorff
The result follows from Modus Tollendo Tollens.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\left({X, \Sigma, \mu}\right)$ be a measure space.
Let $\mu$ be a finite measure.
Let $\Sigma'$ be a sub-$\sigma$-algebra of $\Sigma$.

Then the restricted measure $\mu \restriction_{\Sigma'}$ is also a finite measure.


Proof
By Restricted Measure is Measure, $\mu \restriction_{\Sigma'}$ is a measure.
Now by definition of $\mu \restriction_{\Sigma'}$, have:

$\mu \restriction_{\Sigma'} \left({X}\right) = \mu \left({X}\right) < \infty$
as $\mu$ is a finite measure.

Hence $\mu \restriction_{\Sigma'}$ is also a finite measure.
$\blacksquare$

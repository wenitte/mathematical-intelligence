Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function defined on an interval $I$.
Let $x_0 \in I$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x_0$.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $f$ is differentiable at $x_0$.


Proof
Proof by Counterexample
Consider the real function $f: \R \to \R$ defined as:

$\forall x \in \R: \map f x = \size x$
where $\size x$ denotes the absolute value function.
From Absolute Value Function is Continuous, $f$ is continuous on $\R$.
From Derivative of Absolute Value Function, $f$ is not differentiable at $x = 0$.

Hence $f$ is an example of a real function which at $x_0 = 0$ is continuous at $x_0$ but not differentiable at $x_0$.

Theorem
In the words of Hypsicles of Alexandria:

(surface of dodecahedron) : (surface of icosahedron) = (side of pentagon) . (its perpendicular) : (side of triangle) . (its perp.).
(The Elements: Book $\text{XIV}$: Proposition $5$)


Proof
 $\qquad$ 
What is meant by its perpendicular is a perpendicular from the center of the circle circumscribed around it to the side of it.
In the above diagram:
From Proposition $3$ of Book $\text{XIV} $: Size of Surface of Regular Dodecahedron:

the surface of the dodecahedron is $30$ times its perpendicular times its side.
From Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{XIV} $: Size of Surface of Regular Icosahedron:

the surface of the icosahedron is $30$ times its perpendicular times its side.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $5$ of Book $\text{XIV}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

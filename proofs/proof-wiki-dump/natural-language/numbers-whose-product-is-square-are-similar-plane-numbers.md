Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If two numbers by multiplying one another make a square, they are similar plane numbers.
(The Elements: Book $\text{IX}$: Proposition $2$)


Proof
Let $a$ and $b$ be natural numbers such that $a b$ is square.
From Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{VII} $: Multiples of Ratios of Numbers:

$a : b = a^2 : a b$
We have that $a b$ and $a^2$ are both square.
By Square Numbers are Similar Plane Numbers they are similar plane numbers.
From Proposition $18$ of Book $\text{VIII} $: Between two Similar Plane Numbers exists one Mean Proportional:

there exists one mean proportional between $a^2$ and $a b$.
From Proposition $8$ of Book $\text{VIII} $: Geometric Sequences in Proportion have Same Number of Elements:

there exists one mean proportional between $a$ and $b$.
The result follows from Proposition $20$ of Book $\text{VIII} $: Numbers between which exists one Mean Proportional are Similar Plane.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $2$ of Book $\text{IX}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $1$: Product of Similar Plane Numbers is Square.

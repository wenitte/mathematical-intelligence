Theorem
It is possible to bisect any given rectilineal angle.

In the words of Euclid:

To bisect a given rectilineal angle.
(The Elements: Book $\text{I}$: Proposition $9$)


Construction

Let $\angle BAC$ be the given angle to be bisected.

Let $D$ be an arbitrary point on $AB$.
From Proposition $3$: Construction of Equal Straight Lines from Unequal, let $AE$ be cut off from $AC$ such that $AE = AD$.
From Euclid's First Postulate, let the line segment $DE$ be constructed.
From Proposition $1$: Construction of Equilateral Triangle, let an equilateral triangle $\triangle DEF$ be constructed on $AB$.
From Euclid's First Postulate, let the line segment $AF$ be constructed.

Then the angle $\angle BAC$ has been bisected by the straight line segment $AF$.


Proof
We have:

$AD = AE$
$AF$ is common
$DF = EF$
Thus from Proposition $8$: Triangle Side-Side-Side Congruence:

$\triangle ADF \sim \triangle AEF$
Thus:

$\angle DAF = \angle EAF$

Hence $\angle BAC$ has been bisected by $AF$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $9$ of Book $\text{I}$ of Euclid's The Elements. There are quicker and easier constructions of a bisection, but this particular one uses only results previously demonstrated.

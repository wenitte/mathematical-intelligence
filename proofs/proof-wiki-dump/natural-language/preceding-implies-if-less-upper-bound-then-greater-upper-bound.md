Theorem
Let $L = \struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $x, y \in S$ such that

$x \preceq y$
Let $X \subseteq S$.

Then

$x$ is upper bound for $X \implies y$ is upper bound for $X$
and

$y$ is lower bound for $X \implies x$ is lower bound for $X$.


Proof
First Implication
Let $x$ be upper bound for $X$,
Let $z \in X$.
By definition of upper bound:

$z \preceq x$
Thus by definition of transitivity:

$z \preceq y$
$\Box$


Second Implication
This follows by mutatis mutandis.
$\blacksquare$

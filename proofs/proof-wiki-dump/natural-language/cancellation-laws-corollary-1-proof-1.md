Corollary to Cancellation Laws
$g h = g \implies h = e$


Proof













\(\ds g h\)

\(=\)







\(\ds g\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds g h\)

\(=\)







\(\ds g e\)





Group Axiom $\text G 2$: Existence of Identity Element








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds h\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e\)

Theorem
Let $\struct {A, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a Banach algebra over $\C$.
Let $I$ be a maximal ideal of $A$.

Then $I$ is closed.


Proof
From Closure of Proper Ideal in Unital Banach Algebra is Proper Ideal, the closure $I^-$ is a proper ideal of $A$ with $I \subseteq I^-$.
Since $I$ is a maximal ideal, we have $I = I^-$.
From Set is Closed iff Equals Topological Closure, we conclude that $I$ is closed.
$\blacksquare$

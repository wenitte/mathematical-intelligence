Theorem
Every primitive recursive set is URM computable.


Proof
This follows immediately from:

a set is primitive recursive if its characteristic function is primitive recursive
the fact that every Primitive Recursive Function is URM Computable.
$\blacksquare$


Note
This does not mean that every URM computable set is necessarily primitive recursive.

Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
For $x \in G$, let $\kappa_x$ denote the inner automorphism of $x$ in $G$.

Suppose that:

$\forall x \in G: \kappa_x \sqbrk H = H$
Then $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.


Proof
Suppose that:

$\forall x \in G: \kappa_x \sqbrk H = H$

Let $x \in G$ be arbitrary.
By definition of inner automorphism of $x$ in $G$:

$\forall h \in H: x h x^{-1} \in H$

So, by definition, $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$

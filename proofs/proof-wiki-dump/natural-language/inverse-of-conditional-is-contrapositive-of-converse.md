Theorem
Let $p \implies q$ be a conditional.
Then the inverse of $p \implies q$ is the contrapositive of its converse.


Proof
The inverse of $p \implies q$ is:

$\neg p \implies \neg q$
The converse of $p \implies q$ is:

$q \implies p$
The contrapositive of $q \implies p$ is:

$\neg p \implies \neg q$
The two are seen to be equal.

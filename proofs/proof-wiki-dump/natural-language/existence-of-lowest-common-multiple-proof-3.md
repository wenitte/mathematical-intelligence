Theorem
Let $a, b \in \Z: a b \ne 0$.
The lowest common multiple of $a$ and $b$, denoted $\lcm \set {a, b}$, always exists.


Proof
Note that as Integer Divides Zero, both $a$ and $b$ are divisors of zero.
Thus by definition $0$ is a common multiple of $a$ and $b$.
Non-trivial common multiples of $a$ and $b$ exist.
Indeed, $a b$ and $-\paren {a b}$ are common multiples of $a$ and $b$.
Either $a b$ or $-\paren {a b}$ is strictly positive.
Let $S$ denote the set of strictly positive common multiples of $a$ and $b$.
By the Well-Ordering Principle, $S$ contains a smallest element.
This can then be referred to as the lowest common multiple of $a$ and $b$.

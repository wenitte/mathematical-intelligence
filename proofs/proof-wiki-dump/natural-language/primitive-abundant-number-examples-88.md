Example of Primitive Abundant Number
$88$ is a primitive abundant number:

$1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 11 + 22 + 44 = 92 > 88$


Proof
From $\sigma_1$ of $88$, we have:

$\map {\sigma_1} {88} - 88 = 92$
where $\sigma_1$ denotes the divisor sum function.
Thus, by definition, $88$ is an abundant number.

The aliquot parts of $88$ are enumerated at $\sigma_0$ of $88$:

$1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 22, 44$
By inspecting the divisor sums of each of these, they are seen to be deficient.
Hence the result, by definition of primitive abundant number.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Use of Cohen's Kappa Statistic
Let there be $80$ patients claiming to suffer from depression
Let there be $2$ doctors who are to assess whether or not it is appropriate to treat each patient with a particular antidepressant drug.

In $32$ cases, both agree that treatment is appropriate.
In $35$ cases, both agree that treatment is not appropriate.
In the remaining $13$ cases, they disagree: one doctor believes treatment is appropriate, while the other does not.

Then Cohen's kappa statistic $\kappa$ is evaluated to be:

$\kappa = 0 \cdotp 675$


Proof
Here we have:














\(\ds N\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 80\)




















\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 32 + 35 = 67\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p_{\mathrm {obs} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac n N = 0 \cdotp 8375\)




















\(\ds p_{\mathrm {exp} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {40} {80} = 0 \cdotp 5\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \kappa\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {p_{\mathrm {obs} } - p_{\mathrm {exp} } } {1 - p_{\mathrm {exp} } }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {0 \cdotp 8375 - 0 \cdotp 5} {1 - 0 \cdotp 5}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0 \cdotp 675\)









$\blacksquare$

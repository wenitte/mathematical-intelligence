Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $35$
Sharing a Bicycle
Anderson and Brown have to go $20$ miles and arrive at exactly the same time.
They have only one bicycle.
Anderson can only walk $4$ miles an hour,
while Brown can walk $5$ miles an hour,
but Anderson can ride $10$ miles an hour to Brown's $8$ miles an hour.
How are they to arrange the journey?


Solution
Anderson cycles $11 \tfrac 1 9$ miles, drops the bike, and walks the rest of the way, which is $8 \tfrac 8 9$ miles.
Thus he cycles for $1 \tfrac 1 9$ hours and walks for $2 \tfrac 2 9$ hours.

Brown thus walks $11 \tfrac 1 9$ miles, picks up the bike, and walks the rest of the way, which is $8 \tfrac 8 9$ miles.
Thus he also walks for $2 \tfrac 2 9$ hours and cycles for $1 \tfrac 1 9$ hours.


Proof
Let Anderson and Brown be denoted by $A$ and $B$ respectively.
To keep it simple, we will assume one changeover, and that $A$ starts by cycling.
Let $d$ miles be the distance from the start to where $A$ dismounts to start walking.
Let $t$ hours be the time taken to do the total journey.
Let $t_a$ hours be the time taken by $A$ to travel $d$.
Let $t_b$ hours be the time taken by $B$ to travel $d$.
We have:

Example of Use of Number of Significant Figures in Result of Addition or Subtraction
$83 \cdotp 42 - 72 = 11$


Proof
We have that:

the least significant digit $d_m$ of $83 \cdotp 42$ is the $10^{-2}$ position
the least significant digit $d_n$ of $72$ is the $10^0$ position.

So from Number of Significant Figures in Result of Addition or Subtraction:

the least significant digit of $83 \cdotp 42 - 72$ is the greater significant digit of $10^{-2}$ and $10^0$, that is $10^0$.















\(\ds 83 \cdotp 42 - 72\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 11 \cdotp 42\)





by calculation














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 11\)





to the nearest $10^0$



$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $n \in \N_{> 0}$.
Let $C$ be a subspace of the Euclidean space $\R^n$.

Then $C$ is closed and bounded if and only if it is compact.


Proof
Necessary Condition
For any natural number $n \ge 1$, a closed and bounded subspace of the Euclidean space $\R^n$ is compact.
$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Let $C \subseteq \R^n$ be compact.
From Compact Subspace of Metric Space is Bounded, it follows that $C$ is bounded.
From Metric Space is Hausdorff, it follows that $\R^n$ is a Hausdorff space.
Then Compact Subspace of Hausdorff Space is Closed shows that $C$ is closed.
$\blacksquare$

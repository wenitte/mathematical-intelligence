Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.

Then $S$ has a Hartogs number.


Proof
From Hartogs' lemma there exists an ordinal $\alpha$ such that there is no injection from $\alpha$ to $S$.
We also have that Ordinals are Well-Ordered.
It follows from the definition of well-ordering that there exists a smallest such ordinal.
Hence the result.

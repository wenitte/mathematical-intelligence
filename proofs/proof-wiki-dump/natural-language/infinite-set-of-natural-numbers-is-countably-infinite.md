Theorem
Let $\N$ be the set of natural numbers.
Let $S$ be an infinite subset of $\N$.

Then $S$ is countably infinite.
That is, there is a bijection $f: \N \to S$.


Proof
By Infinite Set has Countably Infinite Subset, we have an injection $g: \N \to S$
But by Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder Theorem/Lemma this produces a bijection $f: \N \to S$
$\blacksquare$

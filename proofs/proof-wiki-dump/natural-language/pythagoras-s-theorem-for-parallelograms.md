Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
Let $ACDE$ and $BCFG$ be parallelograms constructed on the sides $AC$ and $BC$ of $\triangle ABC$.
Let $DE$ and $FG$ be produced to intersect at $H$.
Let $AJ$ and $BI$ be constructed on $A$ and $B$ parallel to and equal to $HC$.

Then the area of the parallelogram $ABIJ$ equals the sum of the areas of the parallelograms $ACDE$ and $BCFG$.


Proof

From Parallelograms with Same Base and Same Height have Equal Area:

$ACDE = ACHR = ATUJ$
and:

$BCFG = BCHS = BIUT$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
Pythagoras's Theorem was extended by Pappus of Alexandria in this interesting manner of which Pythagoras's Theorem is a special case.

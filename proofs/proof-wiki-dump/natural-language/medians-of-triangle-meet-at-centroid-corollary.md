Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
Let $A'$ be the midpoint of $BC$.
Let $B'$ be the midpoint of $AC$.
Let $C'$ be the midpoint of $AB$.
Let $G$ be the centroid of $\triangle ABC$
Let $AA'$ be produced beyond $BC$ to $X$, where $A'X = A'G$.
Then the straight lines $BX$ and $CX$ are parallel to $CC'$ and $BB'$ respectively, and $\dfrac 2 3$ of their length.


Proof

Although this article appears correct, it's inelegant. There has to be a better way of doing it.In particular: modify the diagram to add $C'$ to itYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by redesigning it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Improve}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

Consider the quadrilateral $\Box BGCX$.
Its diagonals are $GX$ and $BC$.
By construction, they bisect each other.
From Quadrilateral with Bisecting Diagonals is Parallelogram, $\Box BGCX$ is a parallelogram.
From Position of Centroid of Triangle on Median:

$BG$ is $\dfrac 2 3$ the length of $BB'$
$GC$ is $\dfrac 2 3$ the length of $CC'$
But as $\Box BGCX$ is a parallelogram:

$BG = CX$
and:

$GC = BX$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

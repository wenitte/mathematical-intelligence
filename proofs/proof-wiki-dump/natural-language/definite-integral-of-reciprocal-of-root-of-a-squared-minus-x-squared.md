Theorem
$\ds \int_0^x \frac {\d t} {\sqrt{1 - t^2} } = \arcsin x$


Proof













\(\ds \int_0^x \frac {\d t} {\sqrt{1 - t^2} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \intlimits {\arcsin \frac t 1} 0 x\)

\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \arcsin x - \arcsin 0\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \arcsin x\)

Theorem
Let $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ be an integral domain.
Let $\Char D$ be the characteristic of $D$.

Then $\Char D$ is either $0$ or a prime number.


Proof
By definition, an integral domain has no proper zero divisors.
If $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ is finite, then from Characteristic of Finite Ring with No Zero Divisors, $\Char D$ is prime.

On the other hand, suppose $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ is not finite.
Then there are no $x, y \in D, x \ne 0 \ne y$ such that $x + y = 0$.
Thus it follows that $\Char D$ is $0$.
$\blacksquare$

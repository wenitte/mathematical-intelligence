Theorem
Let $C$ be a circle on center $O$ in the plane.
Let $T : X \to Y$ be an inversive transformation with $C$ as the inversion circle. 
Then $O$ is the inversion center.
Let $L$ be an arbitrary straight line not containing $O$.
Let $P$ be an arbitrary point on $L$.
Let $P'$ be the image of $P$ under $T$.
Then $P'$ lies on a circle through $O$.


Proof
By Inverse of Circle Through Inversion Center is Straight Line Not Through Inversion Center:

the image under $T$ of a circle through $C$ is a straight line not through $C$.
By definition of inversive transformation, $T$ is an involution.
Thus, the image under $T$ of a straight line not through $C$ is a circle through $C$.
$\blacksquare$

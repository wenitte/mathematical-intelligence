Example of Babylonian Mathematics
A ladder of length $0; 30$ stands upright against a wall.
The upper end slides down a distance $0; 6$.
How far away will the lower end move out from the wall?
All lengths are expressed in Babylonian form.


Solution
The lower end of the ladder will move $0; 18$ away from the wall.


Proof
The ladder will be the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are formed by the wall and the floor.
Let $x$ be the distance of the lower end from the wall after the ladder has finished moving.
We have:














\(\ds 0; 30^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {0;30 - 0;6}^2 + x^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\dfrac {30} {60} }^2 - \paren {\dfrac {30} {60} - \dfrac 6 {60} }^2\)





expressing in conventional fraction form














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 4 - \dfrac {16} {100}\)

Examples of Choice Functions
Let $S$ be a doubleton.
Then there exist $2$ choice functions for $S$.


Proof
Let $S = \set {1, 2}$.
The non-empty subsets of $S$ are $\set 1$, $\set 2$ and $\set {1, 2}$.
A choice function for $S$ must include $1$ element from each of these subsets.
There is $1$ way to select $1$ element from a singleton.
There are $2$ ways to select $1$ element from a soubleton.
Hence by the Product Rule for Counting, there are $1 \times 1 \times 2$ choice functions for $S$.

These choice functions can be defined as:

$\map {f_1} {\set 1} = 1, \map {f_1} {\set 2} = 2, \map {f_1} {\set {1, 2} } = 1$
$\map {f_2} {\set 1} = 1, \map {f_2} {\set 2} = 2, \map {f_2} {\set {1, 2} } = 2$
$\blacksquare$

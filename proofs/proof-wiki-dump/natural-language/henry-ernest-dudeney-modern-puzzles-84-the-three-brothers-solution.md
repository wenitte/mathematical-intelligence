Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $84$
The Three Brothers
The discussion arose before one of the tribunals as to which of a tradesman's three sons could best be spared for service in the Army.
"All I know as to their capabilities," said the father, "is this:
Arthur and Benjamin can do a certain quantity of work in eight days,
which Arthur and Charles will do in nine days,
and which Benjamin and Charles will take ten days over."
Of course, it was at once seen that as longer time was taken over the job whenever Charles was one of the pair,
he must be the slowest worker.
This was all they wanted to know, but it is an interesting puzzle to ascertain just how long each son would be required to do that job alone.
Can you discover?


Solution
Arthur, Benjamin and Charles would take respectively $14 \tfrac {34} {49}$ days, $17 \tfrac {23} {41}$ days, and $23 \tfrac 7 {31}$ days.


Proof
Let $a, b, c$ be the rate of working in jobs per day of (respectively) Arthur, Benjamin and Charles.
Let $t_a, t_b, t_c$ be the number of days it would take (respectively) Arthur, Benjamin and Charles to do the job alone.

We have:














\(\ds a + b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 8\)





Arthur and Benjamin can do a certain quantity of work in eight days,














\(\ds a + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 9\)





which Arthur and Charles will do in nine days,














\(\ds b + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {10}\)





and which Benjamin and Charles will take ten days over.




and so:














\(\ds \paren {a + c} - \paren {b + c}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 9 - \dfrac 1 {10}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a - b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {90}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {a + b} - \paren {a - b}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 8 - \dfrac 1 {90}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {45 - 4} {360}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {41} {720}\)




















\(\ds t_b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 b\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {720} {41}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 17 \tfrac {23} {41}\)
























\(\ds \paren {a + b} - \paren {b + c}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 8 - \dfrac 1 {10}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a - c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 {40}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {a + c} - \paren {a - c}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 9 - \dfrac 1 {40}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {40 - 9} {360}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {31} {720}\)




















\(\ds t_c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 c\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {720} {31}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 23 \tfrac 7 {31}\)


















\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {a + c} + \paren {a - c}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 9 + \dfrac 1 {40}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {40 + 9} {360}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {49} {720}\)




















\(\ds t_a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 1 a\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {720} {49}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 14 \tfrac {34} {49}\)









Hence and so.

Example of Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime
$\map {\sigma_1} {206} = 312$


Proof
We have that:

$206 = 2 \times 103$
and so by definition is a semiprime whose prime factors are distinct.

Hence:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {206}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2 + 1} \paren {103 + 1}\)





Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 104\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 312\)









$\blacksquare$

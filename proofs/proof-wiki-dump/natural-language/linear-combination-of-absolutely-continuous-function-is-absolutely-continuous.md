Theorem
Let $\alpha, \beta$ be real numbers.
Let $I \subseteq \R$ be a real interval.
Let $f, gÂ : I \to \R$ be absolutely continuous real functions.

Then $\alpha f + \beta g$ is absolutely continuous.


Proof
From Multiple of Absolutely Continuous Function is Absolutely Continuous, we have: 

$\alpha f$ and $\beta g$ are absolutely continuous.
We therefore have, by Sum of Absolutely Continuous Functions is Absolutely Continuous:

$\alpha f + \beta g$ is absolutely continuous.
$\blacksquare$

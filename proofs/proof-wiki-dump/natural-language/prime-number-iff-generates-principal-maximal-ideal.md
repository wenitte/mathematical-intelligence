Theorem
Let $\Z_{>0}$ be the set of strictly positive integers.
Let $p \in \Z_{>0}$.
Let $\ideal p$ be the principal ideal of $\Z$ generated by $p$. 

Then $p$ is prime if and only if $\ideal p$ is a maximal ideal of $\Z$.


Proof
First, note that $\Z$ is a principal ideal domain, so all ideals are principal.


Sufficient Condition
Suppose $p$ is prime.
From Integer Divisor is Equivalent to Subset of Ideal, $m \divides n \iff \ideal n \subseteq \ideal m$.
But as $p$ is prime, the only divisors of $p$ are $1$ and $p$ itself.
By Natural Numbers Set Equivalent to Ideals of Integers, it follows that if $p$ is prime, then $\ideal p$ must be a maximal ideal.
$\Box$


Necessary Condition
Let $p \in \Z_{>0}$ such that $\ideal p$ is maximal.
Let $q \in \Z_{>0}$ be a divisor of $p$.
Then:














\(\ds q\)

\(\divides\)







\(\ds p\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \ideal p\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds \ideal q\)

Thus $p$ is prime.

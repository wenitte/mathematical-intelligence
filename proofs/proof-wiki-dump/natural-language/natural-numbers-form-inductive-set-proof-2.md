Theorem
Let $\N$ denote the natural numbers as subset of the real numbers $\R$.

Then $\N$ is an inductive set.


Proof
By the given definition of the natural numbers:

$\N = \bigcap \II$
where $\II$ is the collection of all inductive sets.

The result is a direct application of Intersection of Inductive Set as Subset of Real Numbers is Inductive Set.

Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $25$
De Campo Rotundo
A Round Field
A round field is $400$ perches in circumference.
How many acres does it contain?


Solution
The fourth part of the field's $400$ perches in circumference is $100$.
Multiply this by itself to get $10 \, 000$.
Divide this in $12$ parts; the result is $833$.
Divide this into $12$ parts again; the result if $69$.
This is the number of acres in the field.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The area $\AA$ of a circle in terms of its circumference is:

$\AA = \dfrac {C^2} {4 \pi}$
However, what Alcuin has done is used a value for $\pi$ of $4$.
The actual value (assuming $144$ square perches to the acre) is approximately $88.4$ acres.

Another translator uses a tortuous method to obtain $\AA = 96$ acres, but this uses a value for $\pi$ of $3$.

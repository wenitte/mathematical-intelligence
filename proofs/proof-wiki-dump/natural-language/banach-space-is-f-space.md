Theorem
Let $\GF \in \set {\R, \C}$. 
Let $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a Banach space over $\GF$. 
From Normed Vector Space is Hausdorff Topological Vector Space, we may consider $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ as a topological vector space.

With this identification, $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ is an $F$-Space.


Proof
Let $d$ be the metric induced by $\norm {\, \cdot \,}$.
From Norm Topology Induced by Metric Induced by Norm, $d$ induces the topology on $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$.
Since $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ is a Banach space, $\struct {X, d}$ is a complete metric space. 
From Metric Induced by Norm is Invariant Metric, $d$ is invariant.
Hence $\struct {X, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ is an $F$-Space.

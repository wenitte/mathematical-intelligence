Theorem


Let $A$ and $C$ be arbitrary points on a circle in the plane.
Let $M$ be a point on the circle with arc $AM = $ arc $MC$.
Let $B$ lie on the minor arc of $AM$.
Draw chords $AB$ and $BC$.
Find $D$ such that $MD \perp BC$.
Then:

$AB + BD = DC$


Proof
Find $E$ on $BC$ such that $BD = BE$.

Vertical Angle Theorem



Thus we have five equal angles:

$\angle MBE$
$\angle MEB$
$\angle AFM$
$\angle MFC$
$\angle CEF$

By Triangle with Two Equal Angles is Isosceles:

$\triangle CEF$ is isosceles
By definition of isosceles:

$CE = CF$
Since $\angle AFM = \angle CEF$:

$\angle AFC + \angle ECF =$ two right angles.

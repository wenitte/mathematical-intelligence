Theorem
Let $x$ be a set.
Let $\On$ be the class of all ordinals.
Let $f: x \to \On$ be a mapping.

Then $f$ has an upper bound.


Corollary
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be any ordinal-valued sequence.

Then $\sequence {x_n}$ is bounded above.


Proof
Let $I$ be the image of $f$.
By Union of Set of Ordinals is Ordinal: Corollary, $\bigcup I$ is an ordinal.
But by Union is Smallest Superset, each element of $I$ is a subset of $\bigcup I$.
Thus $\bigcup I$ is an upper bound of $f$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $Q = \Dic 2 = \gen {a, b: a^4 = e, b^2 = a^2, a b a = b}$ be the quaternion group.

Let $\map Z {\Dic 2}$ denote the center of $\Dic 2$.

Then:

$\map Z {\Dic 2} = \set {e, a^2}$


Proof
By definition, the center of $\Dic 2$ is:

$\map Z {\Dic 2} = \set {g \in \Dic 2: g x = x g, \forall x \in \Dic 2}$

We are given that:

$\Dic 2 = \gen {a, b: a^4 = e, b^2 = a^2, a b a = b}$

We have that $\Dic 2$ is generated by $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
Thus:

$x \in \map Z {\Dic 2} \iff x a = a x \land x b = b x$

Let $x \in \map Z {\Dic 2}$.
We have that $x$ can be expressed in the form:

$x = a^i b^j$
for $i \in \set {0, 1, 2, 3}$ and $j \in \set {0, 1}$.

As $x \in \map Z {\Dic 2}$, we have:














\(\ds x a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a x\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^i b^j a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{i + 1} b^j\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b^j a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a b^j\)










For $j = 1$ this means:














\(\ds a b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b a\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{-1} \beta\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{-1}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e\)









But the order of $a$ is $4$, not $2$, and hence:

$a^2 \ne e$
So if $x \in \map Z {\Dic 2}$ it follows that $x$ has to be in the form:

$x = a^i$
for some $i \in \Z_{\ge 0}$.

Again, as $x \in \map Z {\Dic 2}$, we have:














\(\ds x b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b x\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a^i b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b a^i\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^{-i} b\)

\(\ds e\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^4\)





Definition of Order of Group Element




So either $i = 0$ or $2 i = 4$, as $0 \le i \le 4$.
If $i = 0$ then $x = a^0 = e$.
If $2 i = 4$ then:

$x = a^{4 / 2} = a^2$
Hence the result.

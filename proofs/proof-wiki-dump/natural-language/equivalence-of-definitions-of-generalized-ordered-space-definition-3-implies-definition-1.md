Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq, \tau}$ be a generalized ordered space by Definition 3:
$\struct {S, \preceq, \tau}$ is a generalized ordered space if and only if:

$(1): \quad \struct {S, \tau}$ is a Hausdorff space
$(2): \quad$ there exists a sub-basis for $\struct {S, \tau}$ each of whose elements is an upper section or lower section in $S$.

Then $\struct {S, \preceq, \tau}$ is a generalized ordered space by Definition 1:
$\struct {S, \preceq, \tau}$ is a generalized ordered space if and only if:

$(1): \quad \struct {S, \tau}$ is a Hausdorff space
$(2): \quad$ there exists a basis for $\struct {S, \tau}$ whose elements are convex in $S$.


Proof
Let $\SS$ be a sub-basis for $\tau$ consisting of upper sections and lower sections.
Let $\BB$ be the set of intersections of finite subsets of $\SS$.
By Upper Section is Convex, Lower Section is Convex and Intersection of Convex Sets is Convex Set (Order Theory)Â :

the elements of $\BB$ are convex.

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Link to theorem on why this is a basis.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
But $\BB$ is a basis for $\tau$.
Therefore $\tau$ has a basis consisting of convex sets.

Theorem
The integers $11$ and $26$ cannot be represented by the sum of less than $6$ hexagonal numbers.


Proof
Recall the sequence of hexagonal numbers:
The sequence of hexagonal numbers, for $n \in \Z_{\ge 0}$, begins:

$0, 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, 153, 190, 231, \ldots$

Hence:














\(\ds 11\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\)




















\(\ds 26\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 1\)









$\blacksquare$

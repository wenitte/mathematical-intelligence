Theorem
Let $\sin: \C \to \C$ be the complex sine function. 
Then $\sin$ is unbounded.


Proof
By Complex Sine Function is Entire, we have that $\sin$ is an entire function. 
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose that $\sin$ was a bounded function.
Then, by Liouville's Theorem, we would have that $\sin$ is a constant function.
However we have, for instance, by Sine of Zero is Zero: 

$\sin 0 = 0$
and by Sine of 90 Degrees: 

$\sin \dfrac \pi 2 = 1$
Therefore, $\sin$ is clearly not a constant function, a contradiction.
We hence conclude, by Proof by Contradiction, that $\sin$ is unbounded.
$\blacksquare$

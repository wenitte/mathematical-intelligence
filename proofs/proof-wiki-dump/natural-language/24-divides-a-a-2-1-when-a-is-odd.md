Theorem
Let $a \in \Z$ be an odd integer.
Then:

$24 \divides a \paren {a^2 - 1}$
where $\divides$ denotes divisibility.


Proof
First suppose that $a$ is not divisible by $3$.
Then from Square Modulo 24 of Odd Integer Not Divisible by 3:

$24 \divides \paren {a^2 - 1}$
from which the result follows immediately.
$\Box$

Now suppose that $3 \divides a$.
Then immediately:

$3 \divides a \paren {a^2 - 1}$
From Odd Square Modulo 8:

$8 \divides \paren {a^2 - 1}$
and so:

$8 \divides a \paren {a^2 - 1}$

We have from Coprime Integers: $3$ and $8$ that:

$3 \perp 8$
where $\perp$ denotes coprimality.
As we have that:

$8 \divides a \paren {a^2 - 1}$
and:

$3 \divides a \paren {a^2 - 1}$
it follows from Product of Coprime Factors that:

$24 \divides a \paren {a^2 - 1}$
$\blacksquare$

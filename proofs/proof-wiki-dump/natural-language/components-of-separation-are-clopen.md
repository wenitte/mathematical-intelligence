Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a topological space.
Let $A \mid B$ be a separation of $T$.

Then both $A$ and $B$ are clopen in $T$.


Proof
From Set with Relative Complement forms Partition:

$A = \complement_S \left({B}\right)$
and:

$B = \complement_S \left({A}\right)$
where $\complement_S$ denotes the complement relative to $S$.
As $A$ and $B$ are both open, it follows by definition that $A$ and $B$ are also both closed.
That is, by definition, they are clopen.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $r, s \in \Q$ be rational numbers.
Then $r + s \sqrt 2$ is irrational.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $t = r + s \sqrt 2$ be rational.
Then:

$\sqrt 2 = \dfrac {t - r} s$ is also rational.
This contradicts the fact that Square Root of 2 is Irrational.
Hence the result by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

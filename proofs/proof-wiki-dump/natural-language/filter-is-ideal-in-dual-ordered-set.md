Theorem
Let $P = \struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $X$ be a subset of $S$.

Then

$X$ is filter in $P$
if and only if

$X$ is ideal in $P^{-1}$
where $P^{-1} = \struct {S, \succeq}$ denotes the dual of $P$.


Proof
By Dual of Dual Ordering:

dual of $P^{-1}$ is $P$.
Hence by Ideal is Filter in Dual Ordered Set:

the result fallows.
$\blacksquare$

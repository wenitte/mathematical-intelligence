Example of Cyclic Group
Consider the multiplicative group of complex numbers $\struct {\C_{\ne 0}, \times}$.
Consider the subgroup $\gen i$ of $\struct {\C_{\ne 0}, \times}$ generated by $i$.
Then $\gen i$ is an (finite) cyclic group of order $4$.


Proof
We have that $\gen i$ is subgroup generated by a single element of $\struct {\C_{\ne 0}, \times}$
By definition, $\gen i$ is a cyclic group.
By Example: Order of Imaginary Unit in Multiplicative Group of Complex Numbers, $i$ is of finite order $4$.
The result follows by definition of finite cyclic group.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
All left cosets of a group $G$ with respect to a subgroup $H$ are equivalent.
That is, any two left cosets are in one-to-one correspondence.
The same applies to right cosets.

As a special case of this:

$\forall x \in G: \order {x H} = \order H = \order {H x}$
where $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.


Proof
Follows directly from Set Equivalence of Regular Representations.
$\blacksquare$

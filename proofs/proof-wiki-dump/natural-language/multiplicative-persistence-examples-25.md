Examples of Multiplicative Persistence
$25$ is the smallest positive integer which has a multiplicative persistence of $2$.


Proof
Trivially:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 2 \times 5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 1 \times 0\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)










All positive integers between $10$ and $19$ are seen to have a multiplicative persistence of $1$:

$1 \times n = n$
where $n$ is a single digit.

Then for 2-digit positive integers starting with $2$:

$2 \times n > 9 \implies n > 4$
by inspection.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

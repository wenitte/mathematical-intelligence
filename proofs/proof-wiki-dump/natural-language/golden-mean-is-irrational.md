Theorem
The golden mean $\phi$ is irrational.


Proof
By definition of golden mean:

$\phi = \dfrac {1 + \sqrt 5} 2$
By Square Root of Prime is Irrational:

$\sqrt 5$ is irrational.
By Rational Number plus Irrational Number is Irrational:

$1 + \sqrt 5$ is irrational.
By Irrational Number divided by Rational Number is Irrational:

$\dfrac {1 + \sqrt 5} 2$ is irrational.
$\blacksquare$

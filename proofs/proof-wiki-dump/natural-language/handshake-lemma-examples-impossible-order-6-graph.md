Examples of Use of Handshake Lemma
There exists no undirected graph whose vertices have degrees $2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5$.


Proof
If such a graph were to exist, it would have exactly $3$ odd vertices.
This contradicts the Handshake Lemma, which states that the number of odd vertices is even.
$\blacksquare$

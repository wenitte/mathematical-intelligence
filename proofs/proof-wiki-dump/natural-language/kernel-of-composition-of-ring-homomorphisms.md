Theorem
Let $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ be ring homomorphisms.
Let $g \circ f$ be their composition.

Then the kernel of $g \circ f$ is the preimage under $f$ of the kernel of $g$:

$\map \ker {g \circ f} = f^{-1} \sqbrk {\ker g}$


Proof
By definition, the kernel of a ring homomorphism is its kernel when considered as a group homomorphism between the additive groups.
The result follows from Kernel of Composition of Group Homomorphisms.

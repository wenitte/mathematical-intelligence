Theorem
$\map \arctan {\dfrac {\sqrt 3} 3} = \dfrac \pi 6$


Proof
By definition, $\arctan$ is the inverse of the tangent function's restriction to $\openint {-\dfrac \pi 2} {\dfrac \pi 2}$. 
By Tangent of $30 \degrees$: 

$\tan \dfrac \pi 6 = \dfrac {\sqrt 3} 3$.
As $\dfrac \pi 6 \in \openint {-\dfrac \pi 2} {\dfrac \pi 2}$, we have by the definition of an inverse function: 

$\map \arctan {\dfrac {\sqrt 3} 3} = \dfrac \pi 6$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$\map \csc {\dfrac \pi 2 - \theta} = \sec \theta$ for $\theta \ne \paren {2 n + 1} \dfrac \pi 2$
where $\csc$ and $\sec$ are cosecant and secant respectively.

That is, the secant of an angle is the cosecant of its complement.
This relation is defined wherever $\cos \theta \ne 0$.


Proof













\(\ds \map \csc {\frac \pi 2 - \theta}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {\map \sin {\frac \pi 2 - \theta} }\)





Cosecant is Reciprocal of Sine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {\cos \theta}\)





Sine of Complement equals Cosine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sec \theta\)





Secant is Reciprocal of Cosine




The above is valid only where $\cos \theta \ne 0$, as otherwise $\dfrac 1 {\cos \theta}$ is undefined.
From Cosine of Half-Integer Multiple of Pi it follows that this happens when $\theta \ne \paren {2 n + 1} \dfrac \pi 2$.
$\blacksquare$

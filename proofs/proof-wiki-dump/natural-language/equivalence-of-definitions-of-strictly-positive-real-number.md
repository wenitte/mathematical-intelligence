Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Strictly Positive Real Number are equivalent:

Definition $1$
The strictly positive real numbers are the set defined as:

$\R_{>0} := \set {x \in \R: x > 0}$
That is, all the real numbers that are strictly greater than zero.

Definition $2$
The strictly positive real numbers, written $R_{>0}$, is the subset of $\R$ that satisfies the following:




\((\R_{>0} 1)\)  

$:$  



Closure under addition   

  \(\ds \forall x, y \in \R_{>0}:\)

\(\ds x + y \in \R_{>0} \)   







  


\((\R_{>0} 2)\)  

$:$  



Closure under multiplication   

  \(\ds \forall x, y \in \R_{>0}:\)

\(\ds xy \in \R_{>0} \)   







  


\((\R_{>0} 3)\)  

$:$  



Trichotomy   

  \(\ds \forall x \in \R:\)

\(\ds x \in \R_{>0} \lor x = 0 \lor -x \in \R_{>0} \)   







  



Proof
Definition $(1)$ implies Definition $(2)$
Let $x$ be a strictly positive real number by definition $1$.

Recall definition $1$ of Strictly Positive Real Number:
The strictly positive real numbers are the set defined as:

$\R_{>0} := \set {x \in \R: x > 0}$
That is, all the real numbers that are strictly greater than zero.

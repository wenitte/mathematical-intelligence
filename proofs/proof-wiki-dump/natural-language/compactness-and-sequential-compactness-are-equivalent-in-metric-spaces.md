Theorem
Let $\struct {X, d}$ be a metric space. 
Then $\struct {X, d}$ is compact if and only if it is sequentially compact.


Proof
Necessary Condition
This is precisely Compact Subspace of Metric Space is Sequentially Compact in Itself.
$\Box$

Sufficient Condition
This is precisely Sequentially Compact Metric Space is Compact.
$\blacksquare$

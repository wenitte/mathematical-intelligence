The Miller's Toll
A miller was accustomed to take as toll one-tenth of the flour that he ground for his customers.
How much did he grind for a man who had just one bushel after the toll had been taken?


Solution
$1 \tfrac 1 9$ bushels


Proof
Let $x$ bushels be the total quantity of flour ground.
Then:

$x - \dfrac x {10} = 1$
from which:

$x = \dfrac {10} 9$
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

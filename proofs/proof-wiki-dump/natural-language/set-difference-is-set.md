Theorem
Let $x$ be a small class.
Let $A$ be a class.
Let $\map \MM B$ denote that $B$ is small.

Then: 

$\map \MM {x \setminus A}$

By Set Difference as Intersection with Relative Complement:

$\paren {x \setminus A} = \paren {x \cap \map \complement A}$

Work In ProgressIn particular: This rule must be proven for classesYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by completing it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{WIP}} from the code.
Next, by Axiom of Subsets Equivalents, $\paren {x \cap \map \complement A}$ is small.
Therefore:

$\map \MM {x \setminus A}$
$\blacksquare$

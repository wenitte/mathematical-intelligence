Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $136$
Juvenile Highwaymen
Three juvenile highwaymen called upon an apple-woman to "stand and deliver."
Tom seized half of the apples, but returned $10$ to the basket;
Ben took one-third of what were left, but returned $2$ that he did not fancy;
Jim took half of the remainder, but threw back one that was worm-eaten.
The woman was then left with only $12$ in her basket.
How many had she before the raid was made?


Solution
The apple-woman had $40$ apples of which Tom had $10$, Ben had $8$ and Jim had $10$.


Proof
Let $n$ be the number of apples the apple-woman started with.
Let $T$, $B$ and $J$ be the number of apples stolen by Tom, Ben and Jim respectively.
We have:














\(\ds T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac n 2 - 10\)





Tom seized half of the apples, but returned $10$ to the basket;














\(\ds B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {n - T} 3 - 2\)





Ben took one-third of what were left, but returned $2$ that he did not fancy;














\(\ds J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {n - T - B} 2 - 1\)





Jim took half of the remainder, but threw back one that was worm-eaten.














\(\ds n - T - B - J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)





The woman then left with only $12$ in her basket.



These can be more conveniently written as:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds n - 2 T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds n - T - 3 B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds n - T - B - 2 J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)










\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)









\(\ds n - T - B - J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)





$(4) - (3)$




\(\text {(5)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n - T - B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 22\)





susbtituting for $J$ in $(4)$ and simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2 B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16\)





$(5) - (2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8\)










\(\text {(6)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n - T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 30\)





substituting for $B$ in $(2)$ or $(5)$ (either will do) and simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)





$(6) - (1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40\)





substituting for $B$ in $(1)$ or $(6)$ (either will do) and simplifying



$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space.
Let $\BB$ be the set of all open balls of $M$.

Then $\BB$ is a basis for the open sets of $M$.


Proof
Let $U$ be an open set of $M$.
Then by definition:

$\forall y \in U: \exists \epsilon \in \R_{>0}: \map {B_\epsilon} y \subseteq U$
Thus:

$\ds U = \bigcup_{y \mathop \in U} \map {B_\epsilon} y$
$\blacksquare$

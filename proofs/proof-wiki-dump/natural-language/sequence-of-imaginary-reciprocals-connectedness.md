Theorem
Consider the subset $S$ of the complex plane defined as:

$S := \set {\dfrac i n : n \in \Z_{>0} }$
That is:

$S := \set {i, \dfrac i 2, \dfrac i 3, \dfrac i 4, \ldots}$
where $i$ is the imaginary unit.

$S$ is not connected.


Proof
Let $z_1 \in S$ and $z_2 \in S$ be joined by a polygonal path $P$.
Then there are points of $P$ which are not in $S$.
Hence, by definition, $S$ is not connected.
$\blacksquare$

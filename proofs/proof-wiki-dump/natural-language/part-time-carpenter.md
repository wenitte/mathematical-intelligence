Classic Problem
A carpenter agrees to work, on the condition that:

he is paid $\pounds 2$ for every day he works
he forfeits $\pounds 3$ for every day he does not work.
At the end of $30$ days he finds he has paid out exactly as much as he has received.


Solution
$18$ days.


Proof
Let $x$ be the number of days he worked.
Then:














\(\ds 2 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \paren {30 - x}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 90\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 18\)










Checking our work:
For $18$ days and at $\pounds 2$ per day, he earns $\pounds 2 \times 18 = \pounds 36$.
For $12$ days, forfeiting $\pounds 3$ per day, he forfeits $\pounds 3 \times 12 = \pounds 36$.
$\blacksquare$

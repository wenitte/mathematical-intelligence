Theorem
Let $M$ be a class which is minimally inductive under a progressing mapping $g$.
Then every non-empty bounded subset of $M$ has a greatest element.


Proof
A minimally inductive class under $g$ is the same thing as a minimally closed class under $g$ with respect to $\O$.
The result then follows by a direct application of Bounded Subset of Minimally Closed Class under Progressing Mapping has Greatest Element.
$\blacksquare$

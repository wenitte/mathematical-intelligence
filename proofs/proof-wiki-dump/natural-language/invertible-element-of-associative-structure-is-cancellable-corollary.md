Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a monoid whose identity element is $e_S$.
An element of $\struct {S, \circ}$ which is invertible is also cancellable.


Proof
By definition, a monoid is an associative algebraic structure with an identity element.
The result follows from Invertible Element of Associative Structure is Cancellable.

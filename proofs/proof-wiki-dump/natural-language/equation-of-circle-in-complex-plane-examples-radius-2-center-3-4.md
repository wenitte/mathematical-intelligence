Example of Use of Equation of Circle in Complex Plane
Let $C$ be a circle embedded in the complex plane whose radius is $2$ and whose center is $\paren {-3, 4}$.
Then $C$ can be described by the equation:

$\cmod {z + 3 - 4 i} = 2$
or in conventional Cartesian coordinates:

$\paren {x + 3}^2 + \paren {y - 4}^2 = 4$


Proof
From Equation of Circle in Complex Plane, a circle whose radius is $r$ and whose center is $\alpha$ has equation:

$\cmod {z - \alpha} = r$

Substituting $\alpha = -3 + 4 i$ and $r = 2$ gives:

$\cmod {z - \paren {-3 + 4 i} } = 2$
that is:

$\cmod {z + 3 - 4 i} = 2$

Letting $z = x + i y$ gives:














\(\ds \cmod {z + 3 - 4 i}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)




















\(\ds \sqrt {\paren {x + 3}^2 + \paren {y - 4}^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)





Definition of Complex Modulus














\(\ds \paren {x + 3}^2 + \paren {y - 4}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4\)





squaring both sides



$\blacksquare$

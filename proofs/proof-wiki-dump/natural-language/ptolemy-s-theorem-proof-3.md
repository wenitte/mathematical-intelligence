Theorem
Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral.
Then:

$AB \times CD + AD \times BC = AC \times BD$


Proof

Let an arbitrary circle $K$ be drawn in the plane.
Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be arbitrary points on $K$.
By definition, $\Box ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.

We are to show that $AB \cdot CD + BC \cdot AD = AC \cdot BD$.

Let $T$ be an inversive transformation such that:

the inversion center of $T$ is $D$
the inversion circle $O$ for $T$ is chosen such that $K$ is completely inside $O$
the radius of $O$ is $r$.
Let $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$ be the images of $A$, $B$, and $C$ under $T$ respectively.
By Inverse of Circle Through Inversion Center is Straight Line Not Through Inversion Center:

$A'$, $B'$ and $C'$ are collinear.

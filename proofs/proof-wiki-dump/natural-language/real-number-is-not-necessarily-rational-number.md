Theorem
Let $x$ be a real number.
Then it is not necessarily the case that $x$ is also a rational number.


Proof
By Proof by Counterexample:
Let $x = \sqrt 2$.
From Square Root of 2 is Irrational:

$\sqrt 2$ is an irrational number.
By definition:

$x \in \R \setminus \Q$
where:

$\R$ is the set of real numbers
$\Q$ is the set of rational numbers
$\setminus$ denotes the set difference.

Thus $x$, while being a real number, is not also a rational number.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

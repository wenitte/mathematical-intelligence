Theorem
$651 \times 156 = 372 \times 273$


Proof













\(\ds 651 \times 156\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {3 \times 7 \times 31} \times \paren {2^2 \times 3 \times 13}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7 \times 13 \times 31\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2^2 \times 3 \times 31} \times \paren {3 \times 7 \times 13}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 372 \times 273\)









$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
According to David Wells in his Curious and Interesting Numbers of $1986$, this result appeared in a $1939$ issue of Scripta Mathematica, attributed to A.A.K. Iyangar.
However, it has not been possible to corroborate this.

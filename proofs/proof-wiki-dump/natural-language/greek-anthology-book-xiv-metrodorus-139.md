Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
Diodorus, great glory of dial-makers, tell me the hour since when the golden wheels of the sun leapt up from the east to the pole.
Four times three-fifths of the distance he has traversed remain until he sinks to the western sea.


Solution
Let $t$ be the time since dawn.
It is assumed that the day is $12$ hours long.

We have:














\(\ds 12 - t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times \dfrac {3 t} 5\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 60 - 5 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12 t\)





multiplying through by $5$ to clear the fraction








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 17 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 60\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {60} {17}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \frac 9 {17}\)










So $3 \frac 9 {17}$ hours have passed since dawn.
That leaves $12 - 3 \frac 9 {17} = 8 \frac 8 {17}$ hours remaining till sunset.
$\blacksquare$

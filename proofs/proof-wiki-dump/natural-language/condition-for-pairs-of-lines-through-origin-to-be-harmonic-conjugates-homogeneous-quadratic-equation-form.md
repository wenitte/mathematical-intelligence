Theorem
Consider the two homogeneous quadratic equations:




\(\text {(E1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds a_1 x^2 + 2 h_1 x y + b_1 y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)










\(\text {(E2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds a_2 x^2 + 2 h_2 x y + b_2 y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)









each representing two straight lines through the origin.

Then the two straight lines represented by $(\text E1)$ are harmonic conjugates of the two straight lines represented by $(\text E2)$ if and only if:

$a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1 - 2 h_1 h_2 = 0$


Proof
From Homogeneous Quadratic Equation represents Two Straight Lines through Origin, $(\text E1)$ and $(\text E2)$ represent straight lines through the origin if and only if:














\(\ds h_1^2 - a_1 b_1\)

\(>\)







\(\ds 0\)




















\(\ds h_2^2 - a_2 b_2\)

\(>\)







\(\ds 0\)










Let the two straight lines represented by $(\text E1)$ be defined by the equations:














\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \lambda_1 x\)




















\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \mu_1 x\)










Let the two straight lines represented by $(\text E2)$ be defined by the equations:














\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \lambda_2 x\)




















\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \mu_2 x\)










Then we can write the Condition for Pairs of Lines through Origin to be Harmonic Conjugates as:

$(1): \quad 2 \paren {\lambda_1 \mu_1 + \lambda_2 \mu_2} = \paren {\lambda_1 + \mu_1} \paren {\lambda_2 + \mu_2}$

We can express $a_1 x^2 + 2 h_1 x y + b_1 y^2 = 0$ as:

$b_1 \paren {y - \lambda_1 x} \paren {y - \mu_1 x} = 0$
and $a_2 x^2 + 2 h_2 x y + b_2 y^2 = 0$ as:

$b_2 \paren {y - \lambda_2 x} \paren {y - \mu_2 x} = 0$

from which we obtain via Sum of Roots of Quadratic Equation and Product of Roots of Quadratic Equation:














\(\ds \lambda_1 + \mu_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac {2 h_1} {b_1}\)




















\(\ds \lambda_2 + \mu_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac {2 h_2} {b_2}\)




















\(\ds \lambda_1 \mu_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {a_1} {b_1}\)




















\(\ds \lambda_2 \mu_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {a_2} {b_2}\)










Therefore $(1)$ reduces to:














\(\ds 2 \paren {\dfrac {a_1} {b_1} + \dfrac {a_2} {b_2} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {4 h_1 h_2} {b_1 b_2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1 - 2 h_1 h_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)

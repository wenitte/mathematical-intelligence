Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $T \subseteq S$ be a lower section.

Then $T$ is convex in $S$.


Proof
Let $a, c \in T$.
Let $b \in S$.
Let $a \preceq b \preceq c$.
Since:

$c \in T$
$b \preceq c$
$T$ is a lower section
it follows that:

$b \in T$
This holds for all such $a$, $b$, and $c$.
Hence, by definition, $T$ is convex in $S$.

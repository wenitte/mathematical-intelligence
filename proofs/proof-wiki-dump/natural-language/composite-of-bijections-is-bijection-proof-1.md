Theorem
Let $f$ and $g$ be mappings such that $\Dom f = \Cdm g$.

Then:

If $f$ and $g$ are both bijections, then so is $f \circ g$
where $f \circ g$ is the composite mapping of $f$ with $g$.


Proof
As every bijection is also by definition an injection, a composite of bijections is also a composite of injections.
Every composite of injections is also an injection by Composite of Injections is Injection.

As every bijection is also by definition a surjection, a composite of bijections is also a composite of surjections.
Every composite of surjections is also a surjection by Composite of Surjections is Surjection.

As a composite of bijections is therefore both an injection and a surjection, it is also a bijection.

Definition
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $f, g: S \to \C$ be complex-valued functions.
Let $f + g: S \to \C$ denote the pointwise sum of $f$ and $g$.

Then:

$f + g = g + f$

That is, pointwise addition of complex-valued functions is commutative.


Proof









\(\ds \forall x \in S: \, \)



\(\ds \map {\paren {f + g} } x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f x + \map g x\)

Theorem
Let $\theta$ be an angle.

The following definitions of the concept of cosine are equivalent:

Definition from Triangle

In the above right triangle, we are concerned about the angle $\theta$.
The cosine of $\angle \theta$ is defined as being $\dfrac {\text{Adjacent}} {\text{Hypotenuse}}$.

Definition from Circle
Consider a unit circle $C$ whose center is at the origin of a cartesian plane.




Let $P = \tuple {x, y}$ be the point on $C$ in the first quadrant such that $\theta$ is the angle made by $OP$ with the $x$-axis.
Let $AP$ be the perpendicular from $P$ to the $y$-axis.

Then the cosine of $\theta$ is defined as the length of $AP$.
Hence in the first quadrant, the cosine is positive.


Proof
Definition from Triangle implies Definition from Circle
Let $\cos \theta$ be defined as $\dfrac {\text {Adjacent}} {\text {Hypotenuse}}$ in a right triangle.
Consider the triangle $\triangle OAP$.
By construction, $\angle OAP$ is a right angle.
From Parallelism implies Equal Alternate Angles:

$\angle OPA = \theta$

Thus:














\(\ds \cos \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {AP} {OP}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {AP} 1\)





as $OP$ is the radius of the unit circle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds AP\)









That is:

$\cos \theta = AP$
$\Box$


Definition from Circle implies Definition from Triangle
Let $\cos \theta$ be defined as the length of $AP$ in the triangle $\triangle OAP$.
Compare $\triangle OAP$ with $\triangle ABC$ in the diagram above.
From Parallelism implies Equal Alternate Angles:

$\angle OPA = \theta$
We have that:

$\angle CAB = \angle OPA = \theta$
$\angle ABC = \angle OAP$ which is a right angle
Therefore by Triangles with Two Equal Angles are Similar it follows that $\triangle OAP$ and $\triangle ABC$ are similar.
By definition of similarity:














\(\ds \frac {\text {Adjacent} } {\text {Hypotenuse} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {AB} {AC}\)





by definition














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {AP} {OP}\)





Definition of Similar Triangles














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds AP\)





as $OP$ is the radius of the unit circle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cos \theta\)





by definition



That is:

$\dfrac {\text {Adjacent} } {\text {Hypotenuse} } = \cos \theta$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space which is metrizable.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $T$ is second-countable.


Proof
Let $T$ be an uncountable discrete space.
From Standard Discrete Metric induces Discrete Topology, $T$ is metrizable.
From Uncountable Discrete Space is not Second-Countable, $T$ is not second-countable.
$\blacksquare$

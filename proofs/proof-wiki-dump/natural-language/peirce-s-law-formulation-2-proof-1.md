Law of the Excluded Middle
This theorem depends on the Law of the Excluded Middle, by way of Peirce's Law/Formulation 1.
This is one of the logical axioms that was determined by Aristotle, and forms part of the backbone of classical (Aristotelian) logic.
However, the intuitionist school rejects the Law of the Excluded Middle as a valid logical axiom.
This in turn invalidates this theorem from an intuitionistic perspective.

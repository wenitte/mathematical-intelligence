Theorem
Let $G$ be a finite group.
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ which is a $p$-group.

Then $H$ is a subset of every Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$.


Proof
Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$.
By Second Sylow Theorem, $H$ is a subset of a conjugate of $P$.
Then:

$\exists g \in G: H \subseteq g P g^{-1}$.
This implies:














\(\ds H\)

\(=\)







\(\ds g^{-1} H g\)





Subgroup equals Conjugate iff Normal














\(\ds \)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds g^{-1} \paren {g P g^{-1} } g\)





Subset Relation is Compatible with Subset Product/Corollary 2














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds P\)









Since $P$ is arbitrary, $H$ is a subset of every Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$.

Theorem
Let $\TT = ABC$ be an isosceles triangle whose apex is $A$.
Let $\struct {\TT, \circ}$ be the symmetry group of $\TT$, where the symmetries are identified as:

the identity mapping $e$
the reflection $d$ in the line through $A$ and the midpoint of $BC$.


Let $\SS = A'B'C'$ be an equilateral triangle.
We define in cycle notation the following symmetries on $\triangle A'B'C'$:














\(\ds e\)

\(:\)







\(\ds \tuple {A'} \tuple {B'} \tuple {C'}\)





Identity mapping














\(\ds p\)

\(:\)







\(\ds \tuple {A'B'C'}\)





Rotation of $120 \degrees$ anticlockwise about center














\(\ds q\)

\(:\)







\(\ds \tuple {A'C'B'}\)





Rotation of $120 \degrees$ clockwise about center














\(\ds r\)

\(:\)







\(\ds \tuple {B'C'}\)





Reflection in line $r$














\(\ds s\)

\(:\)







\(\ds \tuple {A'C'}\)





Reflection in line $s$














\(\ds t\)

\(:\)







\(\ds \tuple {A'B'}\)





Reflection in line $t$




Then $\struct {\TT, \circ}$ is isomorphic to the $3$ subgroups of $S_3$:














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, \tuple {12} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, \tuple {13} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, \tuple {23} }\)











Proof
We have that $\struct {\TT, \circ}$ is of order $2$.
We also have that:














\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, \tuple {12} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, \tuple {13} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds \set {e, \tuple {23} }\)









are also groups of order $2$.
From Parity Group is Only Group with 2 Elements, all these groups are isomorphic.

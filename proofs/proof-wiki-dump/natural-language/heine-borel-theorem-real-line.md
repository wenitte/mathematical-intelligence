Theorem
Let $\R$ be the real number line considered as a Euclidean space.
Let $C \subseteq \R$.

Then $C$ is closed and bounded in $\R$ if and only if $C$ is compact.


Proof
Necessary Condition
Let $C$ be closed and bounded in $\R$.
Then, by Closed Bounded Subset of Real Numbers is Compact, $C$ is compact.
$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Let $C$ be compact in $\R$.
Then, by Compact Subspace of Real Numbers is Closed and Bounded, $C$ is closed and bounded in $\R$.
$\blacksquare$


Note

This page or section has statements made on it that ought to be extracted and proved in a Theorem page.In particular: Put this into a page of its own: it needs to be proved.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by creating any appropriate Theorem pages that may be needed.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.
This does not apply in the general metric space.
A trivial example is $\left({0 \,.\,.\, 1}\right)$ as a subspace of itself.
It is closed and bounded but not compact.

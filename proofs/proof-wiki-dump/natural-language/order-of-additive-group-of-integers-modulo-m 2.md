Theorem
Let $\struct {\Z_m, +_m}$ denote the additive group of integers modulo $m$.
The order of $\struct {\Z_m, +_m}$ is $m$.


Proof
By definition, the order of a group is the cardinality of its underlying set.
By definition, the underlying set of $\struct {\Z_m, +_m}$ is the set of residue classes $\Z_m$:

$\Z_m = \set {\eqclass 0 m, \eqclass 1 m, \ldots, \eqclass {m - 1} m}$
From Cardinality of Set of Residue Classes, $\Z_m$ has $m$ elements.
Hence the result.

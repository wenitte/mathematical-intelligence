Example of Number of Permutations
The number of ways of choosing $4$ objects in order from a set of $52$ (for example, cards from a deck) is:

${}^{52} P_4 = 52 \times 51 \times 50 \times 49 = \dfrac {52!} {48!} = 6 \, 497 \, 400$


Proof
From Number of Permutations:

${}^{52} P_4 = \dfrac {52!} {\paren {52 - 4}!}$
$\blacksquare$

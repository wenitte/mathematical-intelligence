Theorem
For $n \in \N$, let $f_n$ be the $n$th Fibonacci number.

Then:

$\ds \lim_{n \mathop \to \infty} \frac {f_{n + 1} } {f_n} = \phi$
where $\phi = \dfrac {1 + \sqrt 5} 2$ is the golden mean.


Proof
From Continued Fraction Expansion of Golden Mean: Successive Convergents, the $n$th convergent of the continued fraction expansion of $\phi$ is:

$C_n = \dfrac {f_{n + 1} } {f_n}$
The result follows from Continued Fraction Expansion of Irrational Number Converges to Number Itself.

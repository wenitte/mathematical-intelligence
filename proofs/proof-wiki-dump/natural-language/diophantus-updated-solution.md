Amanda is $21$ years older than her son John.
In $6$ years from now, Amanda will be $5$ times as old as John.

Question
Where is John's father?


Solution
Inside Amanda.


Proof
Let $M$ be the age in years of Amanda now.
Let $C$ be the age in years of John now.
We have:














\(\ds M\)

\(=\)







\(\ds C + 21\)





Amanda is $21$ years older than her son John.














\(\ds M + 6\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 \paren {C + 6}\)





In $6$ years from now, Amanda will be $5$ times as old as John.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds C + 21 + 6\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 \paren {C + 6}\)





substituting for $M$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds C + 27\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 C + 30\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds -3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 C\)





subtracting $C + 30$ from both sides








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\frac 3 4\)









So John is $-\dfrac 3 4$ years old, that is, $-9$ months.
That is, John will be born in $9$ months time.
So, right now, John's father is inside Amanda.

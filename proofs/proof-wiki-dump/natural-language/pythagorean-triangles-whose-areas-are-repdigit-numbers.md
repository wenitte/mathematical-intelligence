Theorem
The following Pythagorean triangles have areas consisting of repdigit numbers:


$3-4-5$ Triangle
The triangle whose sides are of length $3$, $4$ and $5$ is a primitive Pythagorean triangle.
It has area $6$.


$693-1924-2045$ Triangle
The triangle whose sides are of length $693$, $1924$ and $2045$ is a primitive Pythagorean triangle.
It has area $666 \, 666$.


Proof
From Pythagorean Triangle whose Area is Half Perimeter, the area of the $3-4-5$ triangle is $6$, which is trivially repdigit.
The next Pythagorean triangles in area are:

the $6-8-10$ triangle, which has area $\dfrac {6 \times 8} 2 = 24$
the $5-2-13$ triangle, which has area $\dfrac {5 \times 12} 2 = 30$
So there are no more Pythagorean triangles whose areas consist of a single digit.

We have that the $693-1924-2045$ triangle is Pythagorean.
Then its area $A$ is given by:














\(\ds A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {693 \times 1924} 2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\paren {3^2 \times 7 \times 11} \times \paren {2^2 \times 13 \times 37} } 2\)





693 and 1924














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2 \times 3} \times \paren {3 \times 37} \times \paren {7 \times 11 \times 13}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \times 111 \times 1001\)





6, 111 and 1001














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 666 \, 666\)

Theorem
Let $P = \struct {S, \preceq}$ be a preordered set.
Then dual of $P$, $P^{-1} = \struct {S, \succeq}$ is also a preordered set.


This needs considerable tedious hard slog to complete it.In particular: Dual Ordered Set $\ne$ Dual Preordered SetTo discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Finish}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Proof
By Inverse of Reflexive Relation is Reflexive:

$\succeq$ is reflexive.
By Inverse of Transitive Relation is Transitive:

$\succeq$ is transitive.
Hence $\succeq$ is a preordering.
$\blacksquare$

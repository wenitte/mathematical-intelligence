Theorem
Let $x$ be an ordinal.


$\aleph_x \ge \omega$
where:

$\aleph$ denotes the aleph mapping
$\omega$ denotes the minimally inductive set.


Proof
Since $0 \le x$, it follows that $\aleph_0 \le \aleph_x$ by definition of the aleph mapping.

But $\aleph_0 = \omega$ by Aleph-Null.
Therefore, $\omega \le \aleph_x$.
$\blacksquare$

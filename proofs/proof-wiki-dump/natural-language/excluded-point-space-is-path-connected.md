Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_{\bar p} }$ be an excluded point space.

Then $T^*_{\bar p}$ is path-connected.


Proof 1
Excluded Point Topology is Open Extension Topology of Discrete Topology
Open Extension Space is Path-Connected
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Excluded Point Space is Ultraconnected
Ultraconnected Space is Path-Connected
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a finite set.
Let $\leftarrow$ denote the left operation on $S$.

The Cayley table of the algebraic structure $\struct {S, \leftarrow}$ is characterised by the fact that each row contains just one distinct element.


Proof
A row of a Cayley table headed by $x$ contains all those elements of the form $x \leftarrow y$.
By definition of the left operation:

$x \leftarrow y = x$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

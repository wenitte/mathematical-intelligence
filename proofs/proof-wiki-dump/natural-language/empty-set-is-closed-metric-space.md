Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space.

Then the empty set $\O$ is closed in $M$.


Proof
From Metric Space is Open in Itself, $A$ is open in $M$.
But:

$\O = \relcomp A A$
where $\complement_A$ denotes the set complement relative to $A$.
The result follows by definition of closed set.
$\blacksquare$

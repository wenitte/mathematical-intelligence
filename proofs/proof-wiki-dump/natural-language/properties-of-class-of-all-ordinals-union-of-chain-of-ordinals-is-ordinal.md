Theorem
Let $\On$ denote the class of all ordinals.

Let $C$ be a chain of elements of $\On$.
Then its union $\bigcup C$ is also an element of $\On$.


Proof
We have the result that Class of All Ordinals is Minimally Superinductive over Successor Mapping.
Hence $\On$ is a fortiori a superinductive class with respect to the successor mapping.
Hence, by definition of superinductive class:

$\On$ is closed under chain unions.
That is:

$\forall C \in \On: \bigcup C \in \On$
where:

$C$ is a chain of elements of $\On$
$\bigcup C$ is the union of $C$.
$\blacksquare$

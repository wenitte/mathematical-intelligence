Theorem
The set difference with the set difference of two sets is the intersection of the two sets:

$S \setminus \paren {S \setminus T} = S \cap T = T \setminus \paren {T \setminus S}$


Proof 1













\(\ds S \setminus \paren {S \setminus T}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {S \setminus S} \cup \paren {S \cap T}\)





Set Difference with Set Difference is Union of Set Difference with Intersection














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \O \cup \paren {S \cap T}\)





Set Difference with Self is Empty Set














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds S \cap T\)





Union with Empty Set




Interchanging $S$ and $T$:














\(\ds T \setminus \paren {T \setminus S}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds T \cap S\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds S \cap T\)





Intersection is Commutative



$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
From the Axiom of Transitivity, all sets are classes.
The result then follows from Class Difference with Class Difference.


This needs considerable tedious hard slog to complete it.In particular: Find the result that demonstrate the set difference of two sets is also a set, intersection as well. Probably via subset of set is set or something.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Finish}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a discrete topological space.
Then $T$ is fully normal.


Proof
We have that a Discrete Space is fully $T_4$.
Then we note that from Discrete Space satisfies all Separation Properties, a discrete space is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.
Therefore, by definition, $T$ is fully normal.
$\blacksquare$

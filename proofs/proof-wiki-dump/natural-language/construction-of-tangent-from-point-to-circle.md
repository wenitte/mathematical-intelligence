Theorem
From a given point outside a given circle, it is possible to draw a tangent to that circle.

In the words of Euclid:

From a given point to draw a straight line touching a given circle.
(The Elements: Book $\text{III}$: Proposition $17$)


Proof 1

Let $A$ be the given point and let $BCD$ be the given circle.
It is required that a straight line be drawn from $A$ to $BCD$.
Let the center $E$ of $BCD$ be found.
Join $AE$ and draw the circle $AFG$ with center $E$ and radius $AE$.
From $D$ let $DF$ be drawn perpendicular to $EA$.
Join $EF$ and let $B$ be the point at which $EF$ joins the circle $BCD$.
Join $AB$.
Then $AB$ is the required tangent to $BCD$.


Proof of Construction
Since $E$ is the center of the circles $BCD$ and $AFG$, $EA = EF$ and $ED = EB$.
Therefore the two sides $AE, EB$ equal the two sides $FE, ED$, and they contain a common angle at $E$.
So by Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence, $\triangle DEF = \triangle BEA$.
Therefore $\angle EDF = \angle EBA$.
But $\angle EDF$ is a right angle, so $\angle EBA$ is also a right angle.
But $EB$ is a radius of circle $BCD$.
It follows from the porism to Line at Right Angles to Diameter of Circle that $AB$ is tangent to $BCD$.

Proof 2

Let $BCD$ with center $A$ be the circle, and let $E$ be the exterior point from which a tangent is to be drawn.
Bisect $AE$ at $F$.
Then draw a circle $AEG$ whose center is $F$ and whose radius is $AF$.
The point $G$ is where $AEG$ intersects $BCD$.
The line $EG$ is the required tangent.


Proof of Construction
By the method of construction, $AE$ is the diameter of $AEG$.
By Thales' Theorem $\angle AGE$ is a right angle.
But $AG$ is a radius of $BCD$.
The result follows from Radius at Right Angle to Tangent.

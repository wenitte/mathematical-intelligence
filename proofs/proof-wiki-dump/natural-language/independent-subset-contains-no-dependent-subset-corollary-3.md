Theorem
Let $M = \struct {S, \mathscr I}$ be a matroid.
Let $B \subseteq S$ be any base of $M$.

Then:

No circuit $C$ of $M$ is a subset of $B$.


Proof
By definition of matroid base:

$B$ is an independent subset of $M$
From Independent Subset Contains No Circuit:

No circuit $C$ of $M$ is a subset of $B$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
For each $n \in \Z_{>0}$ there exists at least one Latin square of order $n$.


Proof
The Cayley table of a finite group of order $n$ is a Latin square, from Group has Latin Square Property.
For every $n \in \Z_{>0}$ there exists a cyclic group of order $n$.
It follows that for every $n \in \Z_{>0}$ the Cayley table of the cyclic group of order $n$ is a Latin square of order $n$.

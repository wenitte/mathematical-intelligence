Theorem
The circle group $\struct {K, \times}$ is an uncountably infinite group.


Proof
From Quotient Group of Reals by Integers is Circle Group, $\struct {K, \times}$ is isomorphic to the quotient group of $\struct {\R, +}$ by $\struct {\Z, +}$.
But $\dfrac {\struct {\R, +} } {\struct {\Z, +} }$ is the half-open interval $\hointr 0 1$.
A real interval is uncountable by (some result).
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

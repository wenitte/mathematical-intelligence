Example of Exclusive Or
The following is an example of an exclusive or statement:

Either today is Monday or today is not Monday.


Proof
By the Law of Excluded Middle, today is Monday or today is not Monday is a truth.
By the Principle of Non-Contradiction, today is Monday and today is not Monday is a falsehood.
Hence the result by definition of exclusive or.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Consider the celestial sphere with observer $O$.

The plane of the celestial equator is parallel to the plane of the geographical equator.


Proof
Let $P$ denote the north celestial pole.
The celestial equator is by definition perpendicular to $OP$.
Also by definition, $OP$ is parallel to Earth's axis.
Also by definition, Earth's axis is perpendicular to the geographical equator.
Hence $OP$ is also perpendicular to the geographical equator.
The result follows from Planes Perpendicular to same Straight Line are Parallel.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $n \in \N$ be a natural number.
Let $2^n + 1$ be prime.

Then $n = 2^k$ for some natural number $k$.


Proof
A specific instance of Primes of form Power plus One:
$q^n + 1$ is prime only if:

$(1): \quad q$ is even
and

$(2): \quad n$ is of the form $2^k$ for some positive integer $k$.

As $2$ is even, the result applies.
$\blacksquare$

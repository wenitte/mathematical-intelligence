Theorem
Let $\struct {R, \norm {\,\cdot\,}} $ be a normed division ring.

Every convergent sequence in $R$ is a Cauchy sequence.


Proof
Let $d$ be the metric induced on $R$ be the norm $\norm {\,\cdot\,}$.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a sequence in $R$ that converges to the limit $l$ in $\struct {R, \norm {\,\cdot\,}}$.
Thus, by definition, $\sequence {x_n} $ converges to the limit $l$ in $\struct {R, d}$.
By Convergent Sequence is Cauchy Sequence in metric space, $\sequence {x_n} $ is a Cauchy sequence in $\struct {R, d}$.
Thus, by definition, $\sequence {x_n} $ is a Cauchy sequence in $\struct {R, \norm {\,\cdot\,}}$.

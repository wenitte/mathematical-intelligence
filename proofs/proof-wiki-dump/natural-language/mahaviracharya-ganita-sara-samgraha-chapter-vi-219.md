Mahaviracharya: Ganita Sara Samgraha Chapter $\text {VI}$: Mixed Problems: Problem $219$
In how many ways can different numbers of flavours be used in combination together, being selected from:

the astringent
the bitter
the sour
the pungent
and the saline
together with the sweet taste?


Solution
$64$


Proof
A simple application of Cardinality of Power Set of Finite Set.
There are $6$ different flavours.
The number of different combinations is equal to the number of different subsets of this set of $6$.
Hence the number is:

$2^6 = 64$
$\blacksquare$

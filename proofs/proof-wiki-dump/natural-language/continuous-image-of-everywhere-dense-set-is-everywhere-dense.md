Theorem
Let $A_T = \struct {A, \tau_A}$ and $B_T = \struct {B, \tau_B}$ be topological spaces.
Let $f : A \to B$ be an everywhere continuous surjection.
Let $S \subseteq A$ be everywhere dense in $A_T$.

Then, $f \sqbrk S$ is everywhere dense in $B_T$.


Proof













\(\ds \paren {f \sqbrk S}^-\)

\(\supseteq\)







\(\ds f \sqbrk {S^-}\)





Continuity Defined by Closure














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds f \sqbrk A\)





Definition 1 of Everywhere Dense














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds B\)





Definition 2 of Surjection



As $\paren {f \sqbrk S}^- \subseteq B$, by set equality:

$\paren {f \sqbrk S}^- = B$
Therefore, $f \sqbrk S$ is everywhere dense in $B$ by definition.
$\blacksquare$

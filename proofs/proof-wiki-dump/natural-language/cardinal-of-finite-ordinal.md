Theorem
Let $n$ be a finite ordinal.
Let $\card n$ denote the cardinal number of $n$.

Then:

$\card n = n$


Proof
Since $n$ is an ordinal, it follows that $\card n \le n$ by Cardinal Number Less than Ordinal: Corollary.

Hence, $\card n$ is also a finite ordinal.

Since $n$ is an ordinal, it also follows that $n \sim \card n$ by Ordinal Number Equivalent to Cardinal Number.

By Equality of Natural Numbers, it follows that $n = \card n$.

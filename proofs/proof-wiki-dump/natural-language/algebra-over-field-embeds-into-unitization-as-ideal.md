Theorem
Let $K$ be a field.
Let $A$ be an algebra over $K$. 
Let $A_+$ be the unitization of $A$.
Let:

$A_0 = \set {\tuple {x, 0_K}Â : x \in A} \subseteq A_+$.

Then $A_0$ is an ideal in $A_+$. 


Proof
This follows from Ideal of Algebra over Field Embeds into Unitization as Ideal, since $A$ is an ideal of itself.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$\left({R \setminus S}\right) \cap T = \left({R \cap T}\right) \setminus S$


Proof
Consider $R, S, T \subseteq \mathbb U$, where $\mathbb U$ is considered as the universe.

Then:














\(\ds \paren {R \setminus S} \cap T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {R \cap \map \complement S} \cap T\)





Set Difference as Intersection with Complement














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {R \cap T} \cap \map \complement S\)





Intersection is Commutative and Intersection is Associative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {R \cap T} \setminus S\)





Set Difference as Intersection with Complement



$\blacksquare$

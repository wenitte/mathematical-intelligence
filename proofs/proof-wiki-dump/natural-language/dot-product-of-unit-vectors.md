Theorem
Let $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ be unit vectors.
Then their dot product $\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b$ is:

$\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \cos \theta$
where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$.


Proof
We have by definition of dot product :

$\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \norm {\mathbf a} \, \norm {\mathbf b} \cos \theta$
where $\norm {\mathbf a}$ denotes the length of $\mathbf a$.
From Length of Unit Vector is 1:

$\norm {\mathbf a} = \norm {\mathbf b} = 1$
from which the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

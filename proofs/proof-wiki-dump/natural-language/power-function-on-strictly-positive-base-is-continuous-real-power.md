Theorem
Let $a \in \R_{>0}$.
Let $fÂ : \R \to \R$ be the real function defined as:

$\map f x = a^x$
where $a^x$ denotes $a$ to the power of $x$.

Then $f$ is continuous.


Proof
By definition, $a^x$ is the unique continuous extension of $a^r$, for rational $r$.
By definition, continuous extensions are continuous.

Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

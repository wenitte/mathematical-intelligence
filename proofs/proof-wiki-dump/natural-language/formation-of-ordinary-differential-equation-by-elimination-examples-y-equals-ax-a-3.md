Examples of Formation of Ordinary Differential Equation by Elimination
Consider the equation:

$(1): \quad y = A x + A^3$

This can be expressed as the ordinary differential equation:

$y = x \dfrac {\d y} {\d x} + \paren {\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} }^3$


Proof
Differentiating with respect to $x$:














\(\ds \dfrac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds A\)





Power Rule for Derivatives








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x \dfrac {\d y} {\d x} + \paren {\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} }^3\)





substituting for $A$ in $(1)$



$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \tau_{_S} }$ be a topological space.
Let $\struct {R, +, *, \tau_{_R} }$ be a commutative topological ring.
Let $\struct{\map C {S, R}, +, *}$ be the ring of continuous mappings from $S$ to $R$.

Then:

$\struct{\map C {S, R}, +, *}$ is a commutative ring


Proof
From Structure Induced by Commutative Operation is Commutative:

the ring of mappings $\struct{R^S, +, *}$ is commutative
From Ring of Continuous Mappings is Subring of All Mappings:

$\struct{\map C {S, R}, +, *}$ is a subring of $\struct{R^S, +, *}$
From Subring of Commutative Ring is Commutative:

$\struct{\map C {S, R}, +, *}$ is commutative
$\blacksquare$

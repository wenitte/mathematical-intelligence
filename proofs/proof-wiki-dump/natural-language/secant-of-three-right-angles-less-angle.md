Theorem
$\map \sec {\dfrac {3 \pi} 2 - \theta} = -\csc \theta$
where $\sec$ and $\csc$ are secant and cosecant respectively.


Proof













\(\ds \map \sec {\frac {3 \pi} 2 - \theta}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {\map \cos {\frac {3 \pi} 2 - \theta} }\)





Secant is Reciprocal of Cosine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {-\sin \theta}\)





Cosine of Three Right Angles less Angle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\csc \theta\)





Cosecant is Reciprocal of Sine



$\blacksquare$

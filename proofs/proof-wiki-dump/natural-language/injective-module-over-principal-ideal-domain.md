Theorem
Let $D$ be a principal ideal domain.
Let $M$ be a $D$-module.

Then $M$ is injective if and only if it is divisible.


Proof
By Principal Ideal Domain is Dedekind Domain $D$ is a Dedekind domain.
By Injective Module over Dedekind Domain $M$ is injective if and only if it is divisible.
$\blacksquare$

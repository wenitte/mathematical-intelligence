Theorem
Let $\struct {\Q_{\ne 0}, \times}$ be the multiplicative group of rational numbers.
Let $S \subseteq \Q$ where $S = \set {1, -1}$.

Then $\struct {S, \times}$ is a subgroup of $\struct {\Q_{\ne 0}, \times}$.


Proof
By hypothesis, $S$ is not empty.
As $0 \notin S$, it follows that $S \subseteq \Q_{\ne 0}$.
Recall that $-1 \times -1 = 1$ and also $1 \times 1 = 1$.
Thus:

$\forall x \in S: x \times y^{-1} \in S$
The result follows from the One-Step Subgroup Test.

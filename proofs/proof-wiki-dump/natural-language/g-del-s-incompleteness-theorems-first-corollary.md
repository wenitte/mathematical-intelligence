Theorem
Let $T$ be the set of theorems of some recursive set of sentences in the language of arithmetic such that $T$ contains minimal arithmetic.

If $T$ is both consistent and complete, it does not contain minimal arithmetic.


Proof
This is simply the contrapositive of Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem.
$\blacksquare$

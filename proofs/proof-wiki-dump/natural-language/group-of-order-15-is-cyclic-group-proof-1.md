Theorem
Let $G$ be a group whose order is $15$.
Then $G$ is cyclic.


Proof
We have that $15 = 3 \times 5$.
Thus:

$15$ is square-free
$5 \equiv 2 \pmod 3$
$3 \equiv 3 \pmod 5$
The conditions are fulfilled for Condition for Nu Function to be 1.
Thus $\map \nu {15} = 1$ and so all groups of order $15$ are cyclic.
$\blacksquare$

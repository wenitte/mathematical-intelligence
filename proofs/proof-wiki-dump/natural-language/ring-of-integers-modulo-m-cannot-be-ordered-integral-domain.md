Theorem
Let $m \in \Z: m \ge 2$.
Let $\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$‎ be the ring of integers modulo $m$.

Then $\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$ cannot be an ordered integral domain.


Proof
First note that from Ring of Integers Modulo Prime is Integral Domain, $\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$‎ is an integral domain only when $m$ is prime.
So for $m$ composite the result holds.

If $m$ is prime, and $\struct {\Z_m, +, \times}$ is therefore an integral domain, its order is finite. 
The result follows from Finite Integral Domain cannot be Ordered.

Theorem
Let $a$ be a natural number greater than $1$.
Then either:

$a$ is a prime number
or:

there exists a prime number $p \ne a$ such that $p \divides a$
where $\divides$ denotes is a divisor of.

In the words of Euclid:

Any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VII}$: Proposition $32$)


Proof
By definition of composite number $a$ is either prime or composite.

Let $a$ be prime.
Then the statement of the result is fulfilled.

Let $a$ be composite.
Then by Proposition $31$ of Book $\text{VII} $: Composite Number has Prime Factor:

$\exists p: p \divides a$
where $p$ is a prime number.

The result follows by Proof by Cases.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $32$ of Book $\text{VII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

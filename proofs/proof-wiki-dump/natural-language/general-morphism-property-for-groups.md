Theorem
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ and $\struct {H, *}$ be groups.
Let $\phi: G \to H$ be a group homomorphism.

Then:

$\forall g_k \in H: \map \phi {g_1 \circ g_2 \circ \cdots \circ g_n} = \map \phi {g_1} * \map \phi {g_2} * \cdots * \map \phi {g_n}$


Proof
A group is a semigroup.
The result then follows from the General Morphism Property for Semigroups.
$\blacksquare$

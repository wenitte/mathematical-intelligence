Example of Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime
$\map {\sigma_1} {14} = 24$


Proof
We have that:

$14 = 2 \times 7$
and so by definition is a semiprime whose prime factors are distinct.

Hence:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {14}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2 + 1} \paren {7 + 1}\)

\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 8\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 24\)

Theorem
Let $\struct {X, \tau}$ be a locally connected separable topological space. 
Let $\CC$ be the set of components of $\struct {X, \tau}$.

Then $\CC$ is countable.


Proof
From Component of Locally Connected Space is Open:

$\CC \subseteq \tau$
From Equivalence Classes are Disjoint, we have:

the sets in $\CC$ are pairwise disjoint.
From Collection of Pairwise Disjoint Open Sets in Separable Topological Space is Countable, it follows that:

$\CC$ is countable.
$\blacksquare$

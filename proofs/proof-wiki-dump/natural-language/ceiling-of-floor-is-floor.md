Theorem
Let $x \in \R$ be a real number.
Let $\floor x$ denote the floor of $x$, and $\ceiling x$ denote the ceiling of $x$.

Then:

$\ceiling {\floor x} = \floor x$

That is, the ceiling of the floor is the floor.


Proof
Let $y = \floor x$.
By Floor Function is Integer, we have that $y \in \Z$.
Then from Real Number is Integer iff equals Ceiling, we have:

$\ceiling y = y$
So:

$\ceiling {\floor x} = \floor x$
$\blacksquare$

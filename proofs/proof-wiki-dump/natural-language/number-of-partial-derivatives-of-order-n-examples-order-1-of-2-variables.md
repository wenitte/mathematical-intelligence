Examples of Use of Number of Partial Derivatives of Order $n$
Let $u = \map f {x, y}$ be a real function of $2$ variables.
There are $2$ partial derivatives of $u$ of order $1$.

These are:














\(\ds \dfrac {\partial u} {\partial x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {f_1} {x, y}\)




















\(\ds \dfrac {\partial u} {\partial y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {f_2} {x, y}\)











Proof
From Number of Partial Derivatives of Order $n$, there are $m^n$ partial derivatives of order $n$ of a function of $m$ independent variables.
In this case, $m = 2$ and $n = 1$.
Thus there are $2^1 = 2$ partial derivatives of $u$ of order $1$.
$\blacksquare$

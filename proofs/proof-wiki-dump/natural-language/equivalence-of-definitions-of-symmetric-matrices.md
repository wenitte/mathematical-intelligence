Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Symmetric Matrix are equivalent:
Let $\mathbf A$ be a square matrix over a set $S$.

Definition $1$
$\mathbf A$ is a symmetric matrix if and only if:

$\mathbf A = \mathbf A^\intercal$
where $\mathbf A^\intercal$ is the transpose of $\mathbf A$.

That is, if and only if:

$a_{i j} = a_{j i}$
for all $i$ and $j$ for which $a_{i j}$ is defined.

Definition $2$
$\mathbf A$ is a symmetric matrix if and only if it is symmetrical about its main diagonal.


Proof
Definition $(1)$ implies Definition $(2)$
Let $\mathbf A$ be a symmetric matrix by definition $1$.

Recall definition $1$ of Symmetric Matrix:
$\mathbf A$ is a symmetric matrix if and only if:

$\mathbf A = \mathbf A^\intercal$
where $\mathbf A^\intercal$ is the transpose of $\mathbf A$.

That is, if and only if:

$a_{i j} = a_{j i}$
for all $i$ and $j$ for which $a_{i j}$ is defined.



This needs considerable tedious hard slog to complete it.In particular: I'm wicked and I'm lazyTo discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Finish}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

Thus $\mathbf A$ is a symmetric matrix by definition $2$.

Definition $(2)$ implies Definition $(1)$
Let $\mathbf A$ be a symmetric matrix by definition $2$.

Recall definition $2$ of Symmetric Matrix:
$\mathbf A$ is a symmetric matrix if and only if it is symmetrical about its main diagonal.



This needs considerable tedious hard slog to complete it.In particular: I'm still wicked and I'm even lazierTo discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Finish}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

Thus $\mathbf A$ is a symmetric matrix by definition $1$.

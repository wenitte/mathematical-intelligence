Examples of First Supplement to Law of Quadratic Reciprocity
$-1$ is a quadratic residue of $5$.


Proof
From Quadratic Residues of 5:

the set of quadratic residues modulo $5$ is:
$\set {1, 4}$
We have that:

$4 \equiv -1 \pmod 5$
and so $-1$ is therefore a quadratic residue of $5$.

We also have that:

$5 = 4 \times 1 + 1$
and so is of the form $4 n + 1$.
$\blacksquare$

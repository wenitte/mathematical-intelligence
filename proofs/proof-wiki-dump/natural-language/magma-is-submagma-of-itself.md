Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a magma.
Then $\struct {S, \circ}$ is a submagma of itself.


Proof
By definition, a magma is an algebraic structure $\struct {S, \circ}$ where $\circ$ is closed.
That is:

$\forall x, y \in S: x \circ y \in S$
From Set is Subset of Itself, $S \subseteq S$.

By definition, $\struct {T, \circ}$ is a submagma of $S$ if:

$\forall x, y \in T: x \circ y \in T$
It follows from the above that $\struct {S, \circ}$ is, by definition, a submagma of itself.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$\forall n \in \Z: \ceiling x + n = \ceiling {x + n}$
where $\ceiling x$ denotes the ceiling of $x$.


Proof













\(\ds \ceiling {x + n} - 1\)

\(<\)

\(\, \ds x + n \, \)

\(\, \ds \le \, \)



\(\ds \ceiling {x + n}\)





Number is between Ceiling and One Less








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \ceiling {x + n} - n - 1\)

\(<\)

\(\, \ds x \, \)

\(\, \ds \le \, \)



\(\ds \ceiling {x + n} - n\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \ceiling x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \ceiling {x + n} - n\)





Number is between Ceiling and One Less








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \ceiling {x + n}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \ceiling x + n\)





adding $n$ to both sides



$\blacksquare$

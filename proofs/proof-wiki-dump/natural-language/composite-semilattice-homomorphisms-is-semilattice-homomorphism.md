Theorem
Let $S_1 = \struct{A_1, \circ_1}$, $S_2 = \struct{A_2, \circ_2}$ and $S_3 = \struct{A_3, \circ_3}$ be semilattices.

Let $\phi_1: S_1 \to S_2$ and $\phi_2: S_2 \to S_3$ be semilattice homomorphisms.
Let $\phi_2 \circ \phi_1Â : A_1 \to A_3$ be the composite mapping of $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$  

Then:

$\phi_2 \circ \phi_1$ is a semilattice homomorphism of $S_1$ to $S_3$


Proof
Follows immediately from Composite of Homomorphisms is Homomorphism

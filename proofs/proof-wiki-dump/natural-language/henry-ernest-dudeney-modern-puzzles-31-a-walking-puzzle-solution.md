Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $31$
A Walking Puzzle
A man set out at noon to walk from Appleminster to Boneyham,
and a friend of his started at $2$ p.m. on the same day to walk from Boneyham to Appleminster.
They met on the road at $5$ minutes past $4$ o'clock
and each man reached his destination at exactly the same time.
Can you say what time they both arrived?


Solution
$19:00$, that is, $7$ p.m.


Proof
Let Appleminster and Boneyham be referred to as $A$ and $B$.
Let $t$ be the number of hours after $12:00$ at which both men arrived.
Let $d_1$ be the distance from $A$ to $B$.
Let $d_2$ be the distance from $A$ at which the two met.
Let $v_1$ be the speed of the first man.
Let $v_2$ be the speed of the second man.

We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds d_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds v_1 t\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds v_2 \paren {t - 2}\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds v_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {v_2 \paren {t - 2} } t\)










\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds d_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds v_1 \times 4 \tfrac 1 {12}\)





as $16:05$ is $4 \tfrac 1 {12}$ hours after $12:00$




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)









\(\ds d_1 - d_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds v_2 \paren {4 \tfrac 1 {12} - 2}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds v_1 t - \dfrac {49 v_1} {12}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {25 v_2} {12}\)





substituting for $d_1$ and $d_2$ in $(4)$ from $(1)$ and $(3)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {v_2 \paren {t - 2} } t \paren {t - \dfrac {49} {12} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {25 v_2} {12}\)





substituting for $v_1$ from $(2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {t - 2} \paren {12 t - 49}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25 t\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 12 t^2 - 24 t - 49 t + 98\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 25 t\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 t^2 - 49 t + 49\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {6 t - 7} \paren {t - 7}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





factorising








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7\)


















\(\, \ds \text {or} \, \)

\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac 7 6\)









The solution $t = \dfrac 7 6$ leads to a time of $13:10$ which is invalid.
Hence we have $t = 7$, that is, $19:00$ or $7$ p.m.
$\blacksquare$

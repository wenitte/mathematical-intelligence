Theorem
Let $\struct {A, \ast, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$ be a $\text C^\ast$-algebra.
Let $\phiÂ : A \to \C$ be a positive linear functional.

Then:

$\overline {\map \phi x} = \map \phi {x^\ast}$


Proof
From Linear Functional on *-Algebra Real-Valued at Hermitian Elements preserves Star, it is enough to show that:

$\map \phi x \in \R$ whenever $x \in A$ is Hermitian.
This is precisely Positive Linear Functional on C*-Algebra is Real on Hermitian Elements.

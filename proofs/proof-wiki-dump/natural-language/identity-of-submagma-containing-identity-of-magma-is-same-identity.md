Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a magma which has an identity $e$.
Let $\struct {T, \circ}$ be a submagma of $\struct {S, \circ}$ such that $e \in T$.

Then $e$ is the identity of $T$.


Proof
From Identity is Unique, there can be only one identity $e$ of $\struct {S, \circ}$.
We have that:














\(\ds x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds T\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds S\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x \circ e\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x = e \circ x\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)

\(\ds \forall x \in T: \, \)



\(\ds x \circ e\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x = e \circ x\)









That is, $e$ is the (unique} identity of $T$.
$\blacksquare$

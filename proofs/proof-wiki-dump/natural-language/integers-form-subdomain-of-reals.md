Theorem
The integral domain of integers $\struct {\Z, +, \times}$ forms a subdomain of the field of real numbers.


Proof
We have that Integers form Subdomain of Rationals.
We have that Rational Numbers form Subfield of Real Numbers.
Hence the result, from the definition of subdomain.
$\blacksquare$

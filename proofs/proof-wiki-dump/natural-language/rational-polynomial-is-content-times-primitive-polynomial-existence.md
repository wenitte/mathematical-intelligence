Theorem
Let $\Q \sqbrk X$ be the ring of polynomial forms over the field of rational numbers in the indeterminate $X$.
Let $\map f X \in \Q \sqbrk X$.
Then:

$\map f X = \cont f \, \map {f^*} X$
where:

$\cont f$ is the content of $\map f X$
$\map {f^*} X$ is a primitive polynomial.


Proof
Consider the coefficients of $f$ expressed as fractions.
Let $k$ be any positive integer that is divisible by the denominators of all the coefficients of $f$.
Such a number is bound to exist: just multiply all those denominators together, for example.
Then $\map f X$ is a polynomial equal to $\dfrac 1 k$ multiplied by a polynomial with integral coefficients.
Let $d$ be the GCD of all these integral coefficients.
Then $\map f X$ is equal to $\dfrac h k$ multiplied by a primitive polynomial.

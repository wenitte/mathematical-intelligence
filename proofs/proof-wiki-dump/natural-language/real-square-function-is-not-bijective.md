Theorem
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be the real square function:

$\forall x \in \R: \map f x = x^2$
Then $f$ is not a bijection.


Proof
From Real Square Function is not Injective, $f$ is not an injection.
From Real Square Function is not Surjective, $f$ is not a surjection.
The result follows by definition of bijection.

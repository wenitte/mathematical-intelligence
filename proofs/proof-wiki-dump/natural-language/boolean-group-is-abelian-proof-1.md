Theorem
Let $G$ be a Boolean group.

Then $G$ is abelian.


Proof
By definition of Boolean group, all elements of $G$, other than the identity, have order $2$.
By Group Element is Self-Inverse iff Order 2 and Identity is Self-Inverse, all elements of $G$ are self-inverse.
The result follows directly from All Elements Self-Inverse then Abelian.

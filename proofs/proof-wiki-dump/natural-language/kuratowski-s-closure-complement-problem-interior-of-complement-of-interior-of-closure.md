Theorem
Let $\R$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.
Let $A \subseteq \R$ be defined as:














\(\ds A\)

\(:=\)







\(\ds \openint 0 1 \cup \openint 1 2\)

\(\)





\(\, \ds \cup \, \)

The interior of the complement of the interior of the closure of $A$ in $\R$ is given by:














\(\ds A^{- \, \circ \, \prime \, \circ}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \left({\gets \,.\,.\, 0}\right)\)

Definition of Unbounded Open Real Interval








Proof
From Kuratowski's Closure-Complement Problem: Interior of Closure:














\(\ds A^{- \, \circ}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \left({0 \,.\,.\, 2}\right)\)





Definition of Open Real Interval














\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds \cup \, \)

\(\ds \left({4 \,.\,.\, 5}\right)\)





Definition of Open Real Interval




By inspection:














\(\ds A^{- \, \circ \, '}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \left({\gets \,.\,.\, 0}\right]\)





Definition of Unbounded Closed Real Interval

\(\)





\(\, \ds \cup \, \)

\(\ds \left[{2 \,.\,.\, 4}\right]\)





Definition of Closed Real Interval














\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds \cup \, \)

\(\ds \left[{5 \,.\,.\, \to}\right)\)





Definition of Unbounded Closed Real Interval




From Interior of Closed Real Interval is Open Real Interval:

$\left({\gets \,.\,.\, 0}\right]^\circ = \left({\gets \,.\,.\, 0}\right)$
and:

$\left[{2 \,.\,.\, 4}\right]^\circ = \left({2 \,.\,.\, 4}\right)$
and:

$\left[{5 \,.\,.\, \to}\right)^\circ = \left({5 \,.\,.\, \to}\right)$

Theorem
Let $\struct {K, +, \circ}$ be an division ring.
Let $\map Z K$ be the center of $K$.

Then $\map Z K$ is a subfield of $K$.


Proof
For $\map Z K$ to be a subfield of $K$, it needs to be a division ring that is commutative.
Thus the result follows directly from Center of Ring is Commutative Subring.
$\blacksquare$

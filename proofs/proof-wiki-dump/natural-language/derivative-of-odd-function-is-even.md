Theorem
Let $f$ be a differentiable real function such that $f$ is odd.
Then its derivative $f'$ is an even function.


Proof













\(\ds \map f x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\map f {-x}\)





Definition of Odd Function








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac \d {\d x} \map f x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\frac \d {\d x} \map f {-x}\)





differentiating both sides with respect to $x$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {f'} x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\map {f'} {-x} \times \paren {-1}\)





Chain Rule for Derivatives














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {f'} {-x}\)









Hence the result by definition of even function.
$\blacksquare$

Example of Babylonian Mathematics
Consider a Pythagorean triangle whose hypotenuse and one leg are in the ratio $1.54 : 1$.
What are the lengths of that hypotenuse and that leg?


Solution
The lengths in question are $829$ and $540$.


Proof
Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be positive integers such that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ and such that $1.54 \times a = c$.
Without loss of generality, suppose $a$ is even.
From Solutions of Pythagorean Equation, there exist positive integers $p$ and $q$ such that:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 p q\)




















\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds p^2 - q^2\)




















\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds p^2 + q^2\)









Hence it follows that:

$\dfrac c a = \dfrac 1 2 \paren {\dfrac p q + \dfrac q p}$
The Babylonians would then consult the various standard tables of reciprocals which they used for multiplication.
Without these tables, we set:

$\dfrac p q = t$
and solve the quadratic equation:














\(\ds \dfrac 1 2 \paren {t + \dfrac 1 t}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1.54\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t^2 + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3.08 t\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \pm 2.711 \text { or } 0.369\)









We can discard $0.369$ because we are after $p > q$.
Hence:














\(\ds \dfrac p q\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {27} {10}\)





as a rough approximation








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds p\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 27\)




















\(\ds q\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 p q\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 540\)




















\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds p^2 + q^2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 829\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac c a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1.535\)









which is what is found in the original Babylonian clay tablet.

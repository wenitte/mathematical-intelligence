Theorem
Let $\struct {\Z, -}$ denote the algebraic structure formed by the set of integers under the operation of subtraction.

Then $\struct {\Z, -}$ is not a group.


Proof
It is to be demonstrated that $\struct {\Z, -}$ does not satisfy the group axioms.
First it is noted that Integer Subtraction is Closed.
Thus $\struct {\Z, -}$ fulfils Group Axiom $\text G 0$: Closure.

However, we then have Subtraction on Numbers is Not Associative.
So, for example:

$3 - \paren {2 - 1} = 2 \ne \paren {3 - 2} - 1 = 0$
Thus it has been demonstrated that $\struct {\Z, -}$ does not satisfy the group axioms.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

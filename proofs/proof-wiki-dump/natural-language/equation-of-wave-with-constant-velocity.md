Theorem
Let $\phi$ be a wave which is propagated along the $x$-axis in the positive direction with constant velocity $c$ and without change of shape.
Let $\paren {\map \phi x}_{t \mathop = 0} = \map f x$ be the wave profile of $\phi$.

Then the disturbance of $\phi$ at point $x$ and time $t$ can be expressed using the equation:

$\map \phi {x, t} = \map f {x - c t}$
where:

$x$ denotes the displacement from the origin along the $x$-axis
$t$ denotes the time.


Corollary
Let $\phi$ be a wave which is propagated along the $x$-axis in the negative direction with constant velocity $c$ and without change of shape.
Let $\paren {\map \phi x}_{t \mathop = 0} = \map f x$ be the wave profile of $\phi$.

Then the disturbance of $\phi$ at point $x$ and time $t$ can be expressed using the equation:

$\map \phi {x, t} = \map f {x + c t}$


Proof
Let us imagine a snapshot of $\phi$ at the time $t = 0$.
Then, by hypothesis, the wave $\phi$ is described by the equation:

$\phi = \map f x$
Also by hypothesis, $\phi$ is propagated with no change of shape.
Hence, an imagined snapshot of $\phi$ at the general time $t$ will be:

identical with that at $t = 0$
moved along the $x$-axis a distance $s$.

By SUVAT:

$s = c t$
in the positive direction along the $x$-axis.
Let us set the origin at the point $x = c t$.
Let the displacement measured from this new origin be $X$.
Then we have:

$X = x + c t$
Hence the new equation for the wave profile of $\phi$ is:

$\phi = \map f X$
But referred to that original fixed origin, this means:

$\phi = \map f {x - c t}$
$\blacksquare$

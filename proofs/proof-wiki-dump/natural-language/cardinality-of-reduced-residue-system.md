Theorem
Let $n \ge 2$.
Let $\Z'_n$ be the reduced residue system modulo $n$.

Then:

$\card {\Z'_n} = \map \phi n$
where $\map \phi n$ is the Euler phi function.


Proof
Recall the definition of $\Z'_n$:

$\Z'_n = \set {\eqclass k n \in \Z_n: k \perp n}$
and the definition of $\map \phi n$:

$\map \phi n = \card {\set {k: 1 \le k \le n, k \perp n} }$
The result follows from Integer is Congruent to Integer less than Modulus.
$\blacksquare$

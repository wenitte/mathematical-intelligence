Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $T^*_{\bar p} = \struct {S^*_p, \tau^*_{\bar p} }$ be the open extension space of $T$.
Let $U \subseteq S^*_p$.
Then $p$ is a limit point of $U$.


Proof
Every open set of $T^*_p = \struct {S^*_p, \tau^*_{\bar p} }$ except $S^*_p$ does not contain the point $p$ by definition.
So every open set $U \in \tau^*_{\bar p}$ such that $p \in U$ (there is only the one such open set) contains $x$.
So by definition of the limit point of a set, $p$ is a limit point of $U$.
$\blacksquare$

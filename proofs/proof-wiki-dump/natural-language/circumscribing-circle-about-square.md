Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

About a given square to circumscribe a circle.
(The Elements: Book $\text{IV}$: Proposition $9$)


Construction

Let $\Box ABCD$ be the given square.
Join $AC$ and $BD$ and let their point of intersection be $E$.
Draw the circle whose center is $E$ and whose radius is $AE$.
The circle $ABCD$ is the required circle.


Proof
We have that $DA = AB$, $DC = BC$ and $AC$ is common.
So from Triangle Side-Side-Side Congruence $\triangle DAB = \triangle DCB$ and so $\angle DAC = \angle BAC$.
So $\angle DAB$ is bisected by $AC$.
Similarly each of $\angle ABC, \angle BCD, \angle DCA$ are bisected by $AC$ or $DB$.
We have that $\angle DAB = \angle ABC$, $2 \angle EAB = \angle DAB$, $2 \angle EBA = \angle ABC$.
Then $\angle EAB = \angle EBA$.
From Triangle with Two Equal Angles is Isosceles, $EA = EB$.
Similarly, $EA = EB = EC = ED$.
So the circle whose center is $E$ and whose radius is $AE$ passes through each of $B, C, D$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $9$ of Book $\text{IV}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

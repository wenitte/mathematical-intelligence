Example of Irrational Number
$\sqrt 3$ is irrational.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $\sqrt 3 = \dfrac m n$ for integers $m$ and $n$ such that:

$m \perp n$
where $\perp$ denotes coprimality.
Then:

$m^2 = 3 n^2$
Thus $3 \divides m^2$ and so $3 \divides m$.
Hence:

$m = 3 k$
for some $k \in \Z$.
Then:

$9 k^2 = 3 n^2$
and so $3 \divides n$.
But then we have $3 \divides m$ and $3 \divides n$
Hence $m$ and $n$ are not coprime after all.
From this contradiction the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $P$ be a regular antiprism.
Then $P$ is a uniform polyhedron.


Proof
Recall the definition of Uniform Polyhedron:
A uniform polyhedron is a polyhedron:

$(1): \quad$ which is isogonal
$(2): \quad$ whose faces are all regular polygons (but not necessarily all of the same type).

Recall the definition of Regular Antiprism:
Definition:Regular Antiprism
That all the faces of $P$ are regular polygons follows a fortiori from the definition of regular antiprism.
From Regular Antiprism is Isogonal, $P$ is isogonal.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

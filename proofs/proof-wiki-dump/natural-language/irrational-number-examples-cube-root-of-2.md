Example of Irrational Number
$\sqrt [3] 2$ is irrational.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $\sqrt [3] 2 = \dfrac m n$ for integers $m$ and $n$ such that:

$m \perp n$
where $\perp$ denotes coprimality.
Then:

$m^3 = 2 n^2$
Thus $2 \divides m^3$ and so $2 \divides m$.
Hence:

$m = 2 k$
for some $k \in \Z$.
Then:

$8 k^2 = 2 n^2$
and so $2 \divides n$.
But then we have $2 \divides m$ and $2 \divides n$
Hence $m$ and $n$ are not coprime after all.
From this contradiction the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

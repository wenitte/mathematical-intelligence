Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a finite semigroup.
Let $a \in S$ be left cancellable.

Then the left regular representation $\lambda_a$ of $\struct {S, \circ}$ with respect to $a$ is a bijection.


Proof
By Left Cancellable iff Left Regular Representation Injective, $\lambda_a$ is an injection.
By hypothesis, $S$ is finite.
From Injection from Finite Set to Itself is Surjection, $\lambda_a$ is a surjection.
Thus $\lambda_a$ is injective and surjective, and therefore a bijection.
$\blacksquare$

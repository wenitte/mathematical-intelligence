Examples of Continuous Real Functions
Let $f: \R_{\ge 0} \to \R$ be the real function defined as:

$\map f x = \begin {cases} \map \sin {\dfrac 1 x} & : x \ne 0 \\ 0 & : x = 0 \end {cases}$
Then $\map f x$ is not continuous at $x = 0$.


Proof
From Limit of Real Function: $\map \sin {\dfrac 1 x}$ at $0$, $\map f x$ has no limit at $x = 0$.
In order to be continuous at $x = 0$, it needs to have a limit at $x = 0$.
The fact that $\map f x$ is defined at $x = 0$ is immaterial.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

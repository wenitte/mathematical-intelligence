Theorem
Let $n$, $n + 1$ and $n + 2$ be positive integers such that $n + 2$ is a multiple of $3$.
Let $m = n + \paren {n + 1} + \paren {n + 2}$.

Then the digital root of $m$ is $6$.


Proof
Let $n + 2$ be expressed as $3 r$ for some positive integer $r$.
Then:














\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {3 r - 2} + \paren {3 r - 1} + 3 r\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 r - 3\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 \paren {r - 1} + 6\)










The result follows from Digital Root of Number equals its Excess over Multiple of 9.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
According to David Wells in his Curious and Interesting Numbers, 2nd ed. of $1997$, this result is due to Iamblichus Chalcidensis.

Theorem
Let $a, b, c, d$ be numbers.
Then:

$\paren {a^2 + b^2} \paren {c^2 + d^2} = \paren {a c - b d}^2 + \paren {a d + b c}^2$


Proof













\(\ds \paren {a^2 + b^2} \paren {c^2 + d^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a c + b d}^2 + \paren {a d - b c}^2\)





Brahmagupta-Fibonacci Identity








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {a^2 + \paren {-b}^2} \paren {c^2 + d^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a c + \paren {-b} d}^2 + \paren {a d - \paren {-b} c}^2\)





substituting $-b$ for $b$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {a^2 + b^2} \paren {c^2 + d^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a c - b d}^2 + \paren {a d + b c}^2\)

Source of Name
This entry was named for Brahmagupta‎ and Leonardo Fibonacci‎.


Historical Note
Both Brahmagupta‎ and Leonardo Fibonacci‎ described what is now known as the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci Identity in their writings:

628: Brahmagupta: Brahmasphutasiddhanta (The Opening of the Universe)
1225: Fibonacci: Liber quadratorum (The Book of Squares)

However, it appeared earlier than either of those in Diophantus of Alexandria's Arithmetica of the third century C.E.

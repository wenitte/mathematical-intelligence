Corollary to Partition Topology is T3 1/2
Let $S$ be a set and let $\PP$ be a partition on $S$.
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be the partition space whose basis is $\PP$.

Then:

$T$ is a $T_3$ space.


Proof
We have that the Partition Topology is $T_{3 \frac 1 2}$.
We also have that a $T_{3 \frac 1 2}$ Space is $T_3$ Space.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

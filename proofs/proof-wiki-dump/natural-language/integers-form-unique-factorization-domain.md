Theorem
The integers $\struct {\Z, +, \times}$ form a unique factorization domain.


Proof
Follows directly from:

$(1) \quad$ the fundamental theorem of arithmetic
$(2) \quad$ the fact that $\struct {\Z, +, \times}$ is an integral domain
$(3) \quad$ the definitions complete factorization and equivalent factorizations.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\R \setminus \Q$ be the set of irrational numbers.
Let $S$ be the set of all simple infinite continued fractions in $\R$.

The mappings:

$\R \setminus \Q \to S$ that sends an irrational number to its continued fraction expansion
$S \to \R \setminus \Q$ that sends a simple infinite continued fractions to its value
are inverses of each other.


Proof
Note that indeed a Simple Infinite Continued Fraction Converges to Irrational Number.
The result follows from:

Continued Fraction Expansion of Irrational Number Converges to Number Itself
Continued Fraction Expansion of Limit of Simple Infinite Continued Fraction equals Expansion Itself
$\blacksquare$

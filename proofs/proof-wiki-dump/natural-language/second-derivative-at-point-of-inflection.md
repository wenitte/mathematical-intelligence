Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function which is twice differentiable on the open interval $\openint a b$.
Let $f$ have a point of inflection at $\xi \in \openint a b$.

Then:

$\map {f' '} \xi = 0$
where $\map {f' '} \xi$ denotes the second derivative of $f$ at $\xi$.


Proof
By definition of point of inflection, $f'$ has either a local maximum or a local minimum at $\xi$.
From Derivative at Maximum or Minimum, it follows that the derivative of $f'$ at $\xi$ is zero, that is:

$\map {f' '} \xi = 0$
$\blacksquare$

Point with Zero Second Derivative is not necessarily Point of Inflection


Historical Note
The result Second Derivative at Point of Inflection was given by Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz in his $1684$ article Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis, published in Acta Eruditorum.

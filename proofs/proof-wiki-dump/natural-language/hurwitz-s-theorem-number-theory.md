  This article is a landmark page.  It was the $10 \, 000$th proof on $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$!
This proof is about Hurwitz's Theorem in the context of Number Theory. For other uses, see Hurwitz's Theorem.



Theorem
Let $\xi$ be an irrational number.
Then there are infinitely many relatively prime integers $p, q \in \Z$ such that:

$\size {\xi - \dfrac p q} < \dfrac 1 {\sqrt 5 \, q^2}$


Proof
Lemma 1
Let $\xi$ be an irrational number.
Let $A \in \R$ be a real number strictly greater than $\sqrt 5$.
Then there may exist at most a finite number of relatively prime integers $p, q \in \Z$ such that:

$\size {\xi - \dfrac p q} < \dfrac 1 {A \, q^2}$
$\Box$


Lemma 2
Let $\xi$ be an irrational number.
Let there be $3$ consecutive convergents of the continued fraction to $\xi$.
Then at least one of them, $\dfrac p q$ say, satisfies:

$\size {\xi - \dfrac p q} < \dfrac 1 {\sqrt 5 \, q^2}$
$\Box$

There are an infinite number of convergents to $\xi$.
Taking these in sets of $3$ at a time, it can be seen from Lemma 2 that at least one of them satisfies the given inequality.
From Lemma 1 it is seen that this inequality is the best possible.

Theorem
Let $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ be consecutive integers.
Then:

$\exists n \in \Z: a b c d = n^2 - 1$
That is, the product of $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ is one less than a square.


Proof
Lemma
Let $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ be consecutive integers.
Let us wish to prove that the product of $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ is one less than a square.
Then it is sufficient to consider $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ all strictly positive.
$\Box$

As $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are all consecutive, we can express them as:

$a$, $a + 1$, $a + 2$ and $a + 3$
where $a \ge 1$.

Then:














\(\ds a \paren {a + 3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2 + 3 a\)




















\(\ds \paren {a + 1} \paren {a + 2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2 + 3 a + 2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a \paren {a + 1} \paren {a + 2} \paren {a + 3}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a^2 + 3 a} \paren {a^2 + 3 a + 2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {n - 1} \paren {n + 1}\)





where $n = a^2 + 3 a + 1$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds n^2 - 1\)

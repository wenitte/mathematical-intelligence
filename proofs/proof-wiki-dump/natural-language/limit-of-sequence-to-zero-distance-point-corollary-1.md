Corollary to Limit of Sequence to Zero Distance Point
Let $S$ be a non-empty subset of $\R$.
Let the distance $\map d {\xi, S} = 0$ for some $\xi \in \R$.

If $S$ is bounded above, then there exists a sequence $\sequence {x_n}$ in $S$ such that:

$\ds \lim_{n \mathop \to \infty} x_n = \sup S$


Proof
Let $\xi = \sup S$.
Then from Distance from Subset of Real Numbers:

$\map d {\xi, S} = 0$
The result then follows directly from Limit of Sequence to Zero Distance Point.
Note that the terms of this sequence do not necessarily have to be distinct.
$\blacksquare$

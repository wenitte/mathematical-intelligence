Theorem
$x \le \ceiling x < x + 1$
where $\ceiling x$ denotes the ceiling of $x$.


Proof
From Number is between Ceiling and One Less:

$\ceiling x - 1 < x \le \ceiling x$
Thus by adding $1$:

$x + 1 > \paren {\ceiling x - 1} + 1 = \ceiling x$
So:

$x \le \ceiling x$
and:

$\ceiling x < x + 1$
as required.
$\blacksquare$

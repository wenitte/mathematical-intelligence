Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $44$
Their Ages
A man, on being asked the ages of his two sons, stated that
eighteen more than the sum of their ages is double the age of the elder,
and six less than the difference of their ages is the age of the younger.
What are their ages?


Solution
The sons are aged $30$ and $12$.


Proof
Let $a$ and $b$ be the ages of the older and younger son respectively.
We have:














\(\ds a + b + 18\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 a\)





eighteen more than the sum of their ages is double the age of the elder














\(\ds a - b - 6\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b\)





six less than the difference of their ages is the age of the younger








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b + 18\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a\)




















\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 b + 6\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b + 18\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 b + 6\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 30\)

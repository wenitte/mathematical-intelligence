Theorem
Let $S$ be the set of geometric figures.
For $F_1, F_2 \in S$, let $F_1 \cong F_2$ denote that $F_1$ is congruent to $F_2$.

Then $\cong$ is an equivalence relation on $S$.


Proof
Checking in turn each of the criteria for equivalence:


Reflexivity
Geometric Congruence is Equivalence Relation/Reflexivity
$\Box$


Symmetry
Geometric Congruence is Equivalence Relation/Symmetry
$\Box$


Transitivity
Geometric Congruence is Equivalence Relation/Transitivity
$\Box$

$\cong$ has been shown to be reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
Hence by definition it is an equivalence relation.
$\blacksquare$

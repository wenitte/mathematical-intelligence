Corollary to Non-Finite Cardinal is equal to Cardinal Product
Let $S$ be a set that is equinumerous to its cardinal number.
Let $\card S$ denote the cardinal number of $S$.
Let:

$\card S \ge \omega$
where $\omega$ denotes the minimally inductive set.

Then:

$\card {S \times S} = \card S$


Proof
By hypothesis:

$S \sim \card S$

By Cartesian Product Preserves Cardinality:

$S \times S \sim \card S \times \card S$
Therefore:














\(\ds \card {S \times S}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \card {\card S \times \card S}\)





Equivalent Sets have Equal Cardinal Numbers














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \card S\)





Non-Finite Cardinal is equal to Cardinal Product

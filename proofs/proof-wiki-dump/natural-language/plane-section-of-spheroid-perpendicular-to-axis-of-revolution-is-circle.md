Theorem
Let $\SS$ be a spheroid.
Let $\PP$ be a plane section of $\SS$ such that $\PP$ is perpendicular to the axis of revolution of $\SS$.
Then $\PP$ is a circle.


Proof
A spheroid is defined as the solid of revolution formed by rotation of an ellipse about one of its axes.
Hence the result by definition of solid of revolution.
$\blacksquare$

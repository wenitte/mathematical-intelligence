Theorem
The algebraic structure $\struct {\N, +}$ consisting of the set of natural numbers $\N$ under addition $+$ is not a group.


Corollary
The algebraic structure $\struct {\Z_{\ge 0}, +}$ consisting of the set of non-negative integers $\Z_{\ge 0}$ under addition $+$ does not form a subgroup of the additive group of integers.


Proof
From Natural Numbers under Addition form Commutative Monoid, $\struct {\N, +}$ has an identity element $0$.
However, for any $x \in \N$ such that $x \ne 0$ there exists no $y \in \N$ such that $x + y = 0$.
Thus the general element of $\struct {\N, +}$ has no inverse.
Hence the result by definition of group.
$\blacksquare$

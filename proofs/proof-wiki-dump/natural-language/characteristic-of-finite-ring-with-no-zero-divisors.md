Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a finite ring with unity with no proper zero divisors whose zero is $0_R$ and whose unity is $1_R$.
Let $n \ne 0$ be the characteristic of $R$.
Then:

$(1): \quad n$ must be a prime number
$(2): \quad n$ is the order of all non-zero elements in $\struct {R, +}$.
It follows that $\struct {R, +} \cong C_n$, where $C_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$.


Proof 1
Follows directly from Subring Generated by Unity of Ring with Unity.

Proof 2
Suppose $\Char R = n$ where $n$ is composite.
Let $n = r s$, where $r, s \in \Z, r > 1, s > 1$.
First note that:














\(\ds \paren {r \cdot 1_R} \circ \paren {s \cdot 1_R}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {r s} \paren {1_R \circ 1_R}\)





Integral Multiple of Ring Element














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {r s} 1_R\)










Then:














\(\ds \paren {r \cdot 1_R} \circ \paren {s \cdot 1_R}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n \cdot 1_R\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0_R\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds r \cdot 1_R = 0_R\)

\(\lor\)







\(\ds s \cdot 1_R = 0_R\)









as $R$ has no proper zero divisors.
But both $r$ and $s$ are less than $n$ which contradicting the minimality of $n$.
So if $\Char R = n$ it follows that $n$ must be prime.

Now let $x \in R^*$.
Then by Characteristic times Ring Element is Ring Zero, $n \cdot x = 0_R$.
It follows from Element to Power of Multiple of Order is Identity that:

$\order x \divides n$
Since $n$ is prime, either $\order x = 1$ or $\order x = n$.
It cannot be $1$, from Null Ring iff Characteristic is One, so the result follows.

Example of Integers such that Difference with Power of 2 is always Prime
The positive integer $105$ has the property that such that:

$\forall k > 0: 105 - 2^k$
is prime whenever it is (strictly) positive.


Proof













\(\ds 105 - 2^1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 103\)





which is prime














\(\ds 105 - 2^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 101\)





which is prime














\(\ds 105 - 2^3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 97\)





which is prime














\(\ds 105 - 2^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 89\)





which is prime














\(\ds 105 - 2^5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 73\)





which is prime














\(\ds 105 - 2^6\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 41\)





which is prime














\(\ds 105 - 2^7\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -23\)





which is not positive



$\blacksquare$

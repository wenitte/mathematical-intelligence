Theorem
Let $\II$ denote the set of complex numbers of the form $0 + i y$
That is, let $\II$ be the set of all wholly imaginary numbers.

Then the algebraic structure $\struct {\II, +}$ is a group.


Proof
We have that $\II$ is a non-empty subset of the complex numbers $\C$.
Indeed, for example:

$0 + 0 i \in \II$
Now, let $0 + i x, 0 + i y \in \II$.
Then we have:














\(\ds \paren {0 + i x} + \paren {-\paren {0 + i y} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {0 + i x} - \paren {0 + i y}\)





Inverse for Complex Addition














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds i \paren {x - y}\)





Definition of Complex Subtraction














\(\ds \)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \II\)









Hence the result by the One-Step Subgroup Test.

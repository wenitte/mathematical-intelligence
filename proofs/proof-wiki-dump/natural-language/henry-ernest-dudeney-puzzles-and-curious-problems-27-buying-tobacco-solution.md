Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $27$
Buying Tobacco
A box of $50$ cigarettes cost the same in shillings and pence as some tobacco bought in pence and shillings.
The change out of a $10 \shillings$ note was the same as the cost of the cigarettes.
What did the cigarettes cost?


Solution
The cigarettes cost $2 \shillings 5 \oldpence$, while the tobacco cost $5 \shillings 2 \oldpence$


Proof
Recall that $1 \shillings$ is worth $12 \oldpence$
Suppose the cigarettes cost $x \shillings y \oldpence$
Then the tobacco would cost $y \shillings x \oldpence$
In pence, the cigarettes cost $\paren {12 x + y} \oldpence$ while the tobacco cost $\paren {12 y + x} \oldpence$

We are given that:

$10 \times 12 - \paren {12 x + y} - \paren {12 y + x} = \paren {12 x + y}$
which can be rewritten as:

$25 x + 14 y = 120$
Taking $\bmod 5$, we have:

$14 y \equiv 0 \pmod 5$
which by Euclid's Lemma implies that $y$ is divisible by $5$.

$y \ne 0$ as $120$ is not divisible by $25$.
$y < 10$ as $14 y > 120$ otherwise.
Therefore $y = 5$, and $x = 2$ follows.
$\blacksquare$

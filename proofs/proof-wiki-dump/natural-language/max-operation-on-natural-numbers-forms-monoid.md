Theorem
Let $\struct {\N, \max}$ denote the algebraic structure formed from the natural numbers $\N$ and the max operation.

Then $\struct {\N, \max}$ is a monoid.

Its identity element is zero.


Proof
By the Well-Ordering Principle, $\N$ is a well-ordered set.
The result follows from Max Operation on Woset is Monoid.
$\blacksquare$

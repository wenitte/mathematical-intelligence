Lemma to Euler Triangle Formula


Let the bisector of angle $C$ of triangle $\triangle ABC$ be produced to the circumcircle at $P$.
Let $I$ be the incenter of $\triangle ABC$.
Then:

$AP = BP = IP$


Proof
We have by hypothesis:

$AI$, $BI$ and $CI$ bisect their respective angles.
Let the half-angles be:

$\alpha = \dfrac 1 2 \angle CAB$
$\beta = \dfrac 1 2 \angle ABC$
$\gamma = \dfrac 1 2 \angle BCA$

\(=\)







\(\ds BP\)





Equal Angles in Equal Circles














\(\ds \angle BAP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \gamma\)





Angles on Equal Arcs are Equal














\(\ds \angle API\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \angle ABC = 2 \beta\)





Angles on Equal Arcs are Equal








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \angle IAP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \alpha + \gamma\)




















\(\ds \angle AIP\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \alpha + \gamma\)





Sum of Angles of Triangle equals Two Right Angles



By Triangle with Two Equal Angles is Isosceles

$\triangle AIP$ is isosceles
$\leadsto$:

$AP = BP = IP$
$\blacksquare$

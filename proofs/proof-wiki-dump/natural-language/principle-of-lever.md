Physical Law
Let $M$ be a lever in a state of equilibrium.
The mechanical advantage $\mathrm {MA}$ of $M$ is given by:

$\mathrm {MA} = \dfrac b a$
where:

$L$ is the load applied to the lever at point $A$
$E$ is the effort applied to the lever at point $B$
$a$ and $b$ are the distances from the fulcrum to points $A$ and $B$ respectively.


Proof
In equilibrium, the sum of all the moments of all the external forces acting on $M$ is zero.
The moment applied by $L$ about the fulcrum is $L a$.
The moment applied by $E$ about the fulcrum is $-E b$ as it is in the opposite direction to $L$.
The mechanical advantage of $M$ is defined as:

the ratio of the load on $M$ to the effort applied to $M$.
Hence:














\(\ds L a - E b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac L E\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac b a\)









Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
The principle of the lever was discovered by Archimedes of Syracuse.

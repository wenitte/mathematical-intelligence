Problem
Croesus the king dedicated six bowls weighing six minae,
each one drachm heavier than the other.


Solution
It is known that there are $100$ drachms to the mina.

The weights of the bowls form an arithmetic sequence.
Let $a$ denote the weight of the lightest bowl in drachms.
Let $n$ denote the number of bowls.
Let $d$ denote the common difference between the weights in drachms of consecutive bowls arranged in order of weight.
Let $t$ denote the total weight of all bowls in drachms.

We are given:














\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)




















\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \times 100 = 600\)




















\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)










So:














\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n \paren {a + \frac {n - 1} 2 d}\)





Sum of Arithmetic Sequence








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 600\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \paren {a + \frac {6 - 1} 2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 a + 15\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {600 - 15} 6\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {585} 6\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 97 \frac 1 2\)










So the lightest bowl weighs $97 \frac 1 2$ drachms, and it follows that the weights of each bowl in drachms is:

$97 \frac 1 2, 98 \frac 1 2, 99 \frac 1 2, 100 \frac 1 2, 101 \frac 1 2, 102 \frac 1 2$
$\blacksquare$

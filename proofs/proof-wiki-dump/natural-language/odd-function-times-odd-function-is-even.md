Theorem
Let $S \subset \R$ be a symmetric set of real numbers:

$\forall x \in S: -x \in X$
Let $f, g: X \to \R$ be two odd functions.
Let $f \cdot g$ denote the pointwise product of $f$ and $g$.

Then $\paren {f \cdot g}: S \to \R$ is an even function.


Proof













\(\ds \map {\paren {f \cdot g} } {-x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {-x} \cdot \map g {-x}\)

\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {-\map f x} \cdot \paren {-\map g x}\)





Definition of Odd Function














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f x \cdot \map g x\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\paren {f \cdot g} } x\)

Thus, by definition, $\paren {f \cdot g}$ is an even function.

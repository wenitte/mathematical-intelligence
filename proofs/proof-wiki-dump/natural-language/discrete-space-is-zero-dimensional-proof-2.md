Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a discrete space.
Then $T$ is zero dimensional.


Proof
Let $\BB$ be the set:

$\BBÂ := \set {\set x: x \in S}$
From Basis for Discrete Topology, $\BB$ is a basis for $T$.
From Set in Discrete Topology is Clopen, all the elements of $\BB$ are both closed and open.
Hence the result, by definition of zero dimensional space
$\blacksquare$

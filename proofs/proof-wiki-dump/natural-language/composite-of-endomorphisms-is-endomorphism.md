Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \odot_1, \odot_2, \ldots, \odot_n}$ be an algebraic structure.
Let:

$\phi: \struct {S, \odot_1, \odot_2, \ldots, \odot_n} \to \struct {S, \odot_1, \odot_2, \ldots, \odot_n}$
$\psi: \struct {S, \odot_1, \odot_2, \ldots, \odot_n} \to \struct {S, \odot_1, \odot_2, \ldots, \odot_n}$
be endomorphisms.
Then the composite of $\phi$ and $\psi$ is also an endomorphism.


Proof
From Composite of Homomorphisms on Algebraic Structure is Homomorphism, $\psi \circ \phi$ is a homomorphism.
From the definition of composition of mappings, $\psi \circ \phi$ is a mapping from $S$ into $S$.
Hence $\psi \circ \phi$ is an endomorphism.
$\blacksquare$

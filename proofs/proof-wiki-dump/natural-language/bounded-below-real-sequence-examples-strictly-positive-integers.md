Example of Bounded Below Real Sequence
Let $\sequence {s_n}$ be the real sequence defined as:

$s_n = n$
That is:

$\sequence {s_n}$ is the sequence of strictly positive integers.
Then $\sequence {s_n}$ is bounded below.


Proof
All strictly positive integers are by definition greater than zero.
Hence $0$ is a lower bound of $\sequence {s_n}$.
Hence the result by definition of bounded below.
$\blacksquare$

Corollary to Countably Infinite Set in Countably Compact Space has Omega-Accumulation Point
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a countably compact topological space.
Let $\sequence {x_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ be an infinite sequence in $S$.

Then $\sequence {x_n}$ has an accumulation point in $T$.


Proof
Let $A \subseteq S$ be the range of $\sequence {x_n}$:

$A = \set {x_n: n \in \N}$

If $A$ is finite, then consider the equality:

$\ds \N = \bigcup_{y \mathop \in A} \set {n \in \N: x_n = y}$
Therefore, there exists a $y \in A$ such that $\set {n \in \N: x_n = y}$ is an infinite set.
Hence, $y$ is an accumulation point of $\sequence {x_n}$.

Otherwise, $A$ is countably infinite.
Then $A$ has an $\omega$-accumulation point in $T$.
It follows that $\sequence {x_n}$ has an accumulation point in $T$.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Link to a result that states that if $T$ has an $\omega$-accumulation point, then $\sequence {x_n}$ has an accumulation pointYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.

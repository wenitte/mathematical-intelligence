Theorem
The total solid angle around a point has a measure of $4 \pi$ steradians.


Proof
Let $Q$ denote this total solid angle
Recall the definition of Steradian:
The steradian is the SI unit of solid angle.
It is defined as follows.
Let $Q$ be the solid angle under consideration.
Let $S$ be a sphere of radius $r$ whose center is at the vertex of $Q$.
Then $Q$ in steradians is equal to $\dfrac A {r^2}$, where $A$ is the area of $S$ subtended by $Q$.

Hence $Q$ is equal to the total surface area of $S$ divided by $r^2$.
That is:














\(\ds Q\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac A {r^2}\)





where $A$ is the total surface area of $S$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {4 \pi r^2} {r^2}\)





Surface Area of Sphere














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \pi\)





simplification



Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

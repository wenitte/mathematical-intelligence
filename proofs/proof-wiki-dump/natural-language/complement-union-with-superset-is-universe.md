Theorem
$S \subseteq T \iff \map \complement S \cup T = \mathbb U$
where:

$S \subseteq T$ denotes that $S$ is a subset of $T$
$S \cup T$ denotes the union of $S$ and $T$
$\complement$ denotes set complement
$\mathbb U$ denotes the universal set.


Corollary
$S \cup T = \mathbb U \iff \map \complement S \subseteq T$


Proof













\(\ds S\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds T\)

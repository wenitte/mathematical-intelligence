Theorem
Let $n$ be an element of the minimally inductive set.
Let $x$ be an ordinal.

Then:

$n \sim x \implies n = x$


Proof
Let $n \ne x$.
Then either $n < x$ or $x < n$ by Ordinal Membership is Trichotomy.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: Link to the result which states that $\le$ is isomorphic to $\subseteq$ on ordinals.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.

If $x < n$, then by Subset of Finite Set is Finite both $x$ and $n$ are finite.
Therefore by No Bijection between Finite Set and Proper Subset:

$x \not \sim n$

Suppose $n < x$.
Then $x \sim n$ implies that $x$ is finite by definition.
By No Bijection between Finite Set and Proper Subset:

$x \not \sim n$

Therefore by Rule of Transposition:

$n \sim x \implies n = x$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The reciprocal function:

$\operatorname{recip}: \R \setminus \set 0 \to \R$, $x \mapsto \dfrac 1 x$
is strictly decreasing:

on the open interval $\openint 0 \to$
on the open interval $\openint \gets 0$


Proof
Let $x \in \openint 0 {+\infty}$.
By the definition of negative powers:

$\dfrac 1 x = x^{-1}$
From Power Rule for Derivatives:














\(\ds \frac \d {\d x} x^{-1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -x^{-2}\)









From Square of Real Number is Non-Negative:

$-x^{-2} < 0$
for all $x$ within the domain.
Thus from Derivative of Monotone Function, $\operatorname{recip}$ is strictly decreasing.
The proof for $x \in \openint {-\infty} 0$ is similar.
$\blacksquare$

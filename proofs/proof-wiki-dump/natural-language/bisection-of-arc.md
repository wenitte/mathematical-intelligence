Theorem
It is possible to bisect an arc of a circle.

In the words of Euclid:

To bisect a given circumference.
(The Elements: Book $\text{III}$: Proposition $30$)


Construction

Let $AB$ be the given arc.
Join the line $AB$ and bisect it at $C$.
Construct the line $CD$ perpendicular to $AB$ at $C$.
Then the arc $AB$ has been bisected at $D$.


Proof
Join $AD$ and $BD$.
We have that $AC = CB$ and $CD$ is common.
We also have that $\angle ACD = \angle BCD$ as they are both right angles.
So from Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence $\triangle ACD = \triangle BCD$ and so $AD = BD$.
But from Straight Lines Cut Off Equal Arcs in Equal Circles, the arc $AD$ equals the arc $BD$.
That is, the arc $AB$ has been bisected at $D$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $30$ of Book $\text{III}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Theorem
Let $\mathbf C$ be a metacategory.
Let $\mathbf C^{\operatorname{op}}$ be the dual category of $\mathbf C$.
Let $f$ be a morphism of $\mathbf C$.

Then $f$ is an isomorphism in $\mathbf C$ if and only if $f^{\operatorname{op}}$ is an isomorphism in $\mathbf C^{\operatorname{op}}$.


Proof
$\blacksquare$

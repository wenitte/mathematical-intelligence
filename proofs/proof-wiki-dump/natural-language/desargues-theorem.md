Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle A'B'C'$ be triangles lying in the same or different planes.
Let the lines $AA'$, $BB'$ and $CC'$ intersect in the point $O$.

Then:

$BC$ meets $B'C'$ in $L$
$CA$ meets $C'A'$ in $M$
$AB$ meets $A'B'$ in $N$
where $L, M, N$ are collinear.


Converse
Let $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle A'B'C'$ be triangles lying in the same or different planes.
Let:

$BC$ meet $B'C'$ in $L$
$CA$ meet $C'A'$ in $M$
$AB$ meet $A'B'$ in $N$
where $L, M, N$ are collinear.

Then the lines $AA'$, $BB'$ and $CC'$ intersect in the point $O$.


Proof


Let $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle A'B'C'$ be in different planes $\pi$ and $\pi'$ respectively.
Since $BB'$ and $CC'$ intersect in $O$, it follows that $B$, $B'$, $C$ and $C'$ lie in a plane.
Thus $BC$ must meet $B'C'$ in a point $L$.
By the same argument, $CA$ meets $C'A'$ in a point $M$ and $AB$ meets $A'B'$ in a point $N$.
These points $L, M, N$ are in each of the planes $\pi$ and $\pi'$.
By Two Planes have Line in Common they are therefore collinear on the line where $\pi$ and $\pi'$ meet.

Now let $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle A'B'C'$ be in the same plane $\pi$.
Let $OPP'$ be any line through $O$ which does not lie in $\pi$.
Then since $PP'$ meets $AA'$ in $O$, the four points $P, P', A, A$ are coplanar.
Thus $PA$ meets $P'A'$ at a point $A' '$.
Similarly $PB$ meets $P'B'$ at a point $B' '$, and $PC$ meets $P'C'$ at a point $C' '$.
The lines $BC, B'C'$ and $B' 'C' '$ are the three lines of intersection of the three planes $PBC$, $P'B'C'$ and $\pi$ taken in pairs.
So $BC$, $B'C'$ and $B' 'C' '$ meet in a point $L$.
Similarly $CA$, $C'A'$ and $C' 'A' '$ meet in a point $M$ and $AB$, $A'B'$ and $A' 'B' '$ meet in a point $N$.
The two triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle A' 'B' 'C' '$ are in different planes, and $AA' '$, $BB' '$ and $CC' '$ meet in $P$.
Thus $L$, $M$ and $N$ are collinear by the first part of this proof.

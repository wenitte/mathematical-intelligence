Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \vee, \preceq}$ be a join semilattice.
Let $\wedge$ denote meet.

Then $\wedge$ absorbs $\vee$.
That is, for all $a, b \in S$:

$a \wedge \paren {a \vee b} = a$


Proof
By Dual Pairs (Order Theory), we observe that the theorem statement is dual to that of Join Absorbs Meet.
The result follows by the Global Duality Principle.
$\blacksquare$


Duality
The dual to this theorem is Join Absorbs Meet.

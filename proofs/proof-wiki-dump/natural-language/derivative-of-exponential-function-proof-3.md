Theorem
Let $\exp$ be the exponential function.
Then:

$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\exp x} = \exp x$


Proof













\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {\ln e^x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d x} } x\)





Exponential of Natural Logarithm








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac 1 {e^x} \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {e^x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)





Chain Rule for Derivatives, Derivative of Natural Logarithm Function, Derivative of Identity Function








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {e^x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds e^x\)





multiply both sides by $e^x$



$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\N_{>0}$ be the set of natural numbers without zero, i.e. $\N_{>0} = \N \setminus \set 0$.
The structure $\struct{\N_{>0}, \times}$ forms a commutative monoid.


Proof
From Non-Zero Natural Numbers under Multiplication form Commutative Semigroup, $\struct {\N_{>0}, \times}$ forms a commutative semigroup.
From Identity Element of Natural Number Multiplication is One, $\struct {\N_{>0}, \times}$ has an identity element which is $1$.
Hence the result, by definition of commutative monoid.
$\blacksquare$

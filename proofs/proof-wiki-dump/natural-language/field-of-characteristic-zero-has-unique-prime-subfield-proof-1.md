Theorem
Let $F$ be a field, whose zero is $0_F$ and whose unity is $1_F$, with characteristic zero.
Then there exists a unique $P \subseteq F$ such that:

$(1): \quad P$ is a subfield of $F$
$(2): \quad P$ is isomorphic to the field of rational numbers $\struct {\Q, +, \times}$.

That is, $P \cong \Q$ is a unique minimal subfield of $F$, and all other subfields of $F$ contain $P$.

This field $P$ is called the prime subfield of $F$.


Proof
Follows directly from:

Subring Generated by Unity of Ring with Unity
Quotient Theorem for Monomorphisms
$\blacksquare$

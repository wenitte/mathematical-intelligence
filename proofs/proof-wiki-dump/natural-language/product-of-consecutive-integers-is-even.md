Theorem
Let $a$ and $b$ be consecutive integers.
Then $a b$ is even.


Proof
Without loss of generality let $a < b$.
Then $b$ can be expressed as $a + 1$.
Hence:














\(\ds a b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \paren {a + 1}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^2 + a\)









From Parity of Integer equals Parity of its Square, $a$ and $a^2$ are either both even or both odd.
The result follows from:

Sum of Even Integers is Even
and:

Sum of Even Number of Odd Numbers is Even
$\blacksquare$

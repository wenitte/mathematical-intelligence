Theorem
The empty set can be characterised as:

$\O := \set {x: x \in E \text { and } x \notin E}$
where $E$ is an arbitrary set.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $x \in \O$ as defined here.
Thus we have:

$x \in E$
and:

$x \notin E$
This is a contradiction.

It follows by Proof by Contradiction that $x \notin \O$.
Hence, as $x$ was arbitrary, there can be no $x$ such that $x \in \O$.
Thus $\O$ is the empty set by definition.
$\blacksquare$

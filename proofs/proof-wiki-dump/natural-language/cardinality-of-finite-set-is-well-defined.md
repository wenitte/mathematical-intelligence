Theorem
Let $S$ be a finite set.
Then there is a unique natural number $n$ such that $S \sim \N_n$, where:

$\sim$ represents set equivalence
and:

$\N_n = \set {0, 1, \dotsc, n - 1}$ is the initial segment of $\N$ determined by $n$.


Proof
By the definition of finite set, there is an $n \in \N$ such that $S \sim \N_n$.
Suppose $m \in \N$ and $S \sim \N_m$.
It follows from Set Equivalence behaves like Equivalence Relation that $\N_n \sim \N_m$.
Thus by Equality of Natural Numbers, $n = m$.  
Therefore the cardinality of a finite set is well-defined.

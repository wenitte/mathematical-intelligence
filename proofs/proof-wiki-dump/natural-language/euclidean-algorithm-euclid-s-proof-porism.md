Porism to Euclidean Algorithm
In the words of Euclid:

From this it is manifest that, if a number measure two numbers, it will also measure their greatest common divisor.
(The Elements: Book $\text{VII}$: Proposition $2$ : Porism)


Proof
An algebraic proof of this is given in Common Divisor Divides GCD.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $2$ of Book $\text{VII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

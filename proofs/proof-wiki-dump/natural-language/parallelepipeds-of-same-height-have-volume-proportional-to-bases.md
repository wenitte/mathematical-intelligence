Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

Parallelepidedal solids which are of the same height are to one another as their bases.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XI}$: Proposition $32$)


Proof

Let $AB$ and $CD$ be parallelepipeds of the same height.
Let $AE$ be the base of $AB$ and $CF$ be the base of $AB$.
Using Proposition $45$ of Book $\text{I} $: Construction of Parallelogram in Given Angle equal to Given Polygon:

Let the parallelogram $FH$ equal in area to $AE$ be applied to $FG$.
Let the parallelepiped $GK$ be constructed with the same height as $CD$ on the base $FH$.
Then from Proposition $31$ of Book $\text{XI} $: Parallelepipeds on Equal Bases and Same Height are Equal in Volume:

the parallelepiped $AB$ equals the parallelepiped $GH$.
We have that the parallelepiped $CK$ is cut by the plane $DG$ which is parallel to opposite planes.
Therefore from Proposition $25$ of Book $\text{XI} $: Parallelepiped cut by Plane Parallel to Opposite Planes:

the parallelepiped $CD$ is to the parallelepiped $DH$ as the base $CF$ is to the base $FH$.
But:

the base $FH$ equals the base $AE$
and:

the parallelepiped $GK$ equals the parallelepiped $AB$.
Therefore, as the base $AE$ is to the base $CF$, the parallelepiped $AB$ is to the parallelepiped $CD$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $32$ of Book $\text{XI}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

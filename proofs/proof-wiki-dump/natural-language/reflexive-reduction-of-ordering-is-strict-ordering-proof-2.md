Theorem
Let $\RR$ be an ordering on a set $S$.
Let $\RR^\ne$ be the reflexive reduction of $\RR$.

Then $\RR^\ne$ is a strict ordering on $S$.


Proof
By definition, an ordering is both antisymmetric and transitive.
The result then follows from Reflexive Reduction of Transitive Antisymmetric Relation is Strict Ordering.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a commutative ring with unity whose zero is $0_R$ and whose unity is $1_R$.

Then $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ is a field if and only if the only ideals of $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ are $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ and $\set {0_R}$.


Proof
Necessary Condition
Let $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ be a field.
The result follows from Field has 2 Ideals.
$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Suppose that the only ideals of $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ are $\struct {R, +, \circ}$ and $\set {0_R}$.
The result follows from Commutative and Unitary Ring with 2 Ideals is Field
$\blacksquare$

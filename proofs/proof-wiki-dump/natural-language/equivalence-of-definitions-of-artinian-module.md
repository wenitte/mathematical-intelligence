Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Artinian Module are equivalent:

Definition 1
$M$ is a Artinian module if and only if:

$M$ satisfies the descending chain condition.
Definition 2
$M$ is a Artinian module if and only if:

$M$ satisfies the minimal condition.


Proof
Definition 1 iff Definition 2
Let $D$ be the set of all submodules of $M$.
We shall show that:

descending chain condition
minimal condition
with respect to $\struct {D, \supseteq}$ are equivalent.
This is nothing but:

ascending chain condition
maximal condition
with respect to $\struct {D, \subseteq}$ are equivalent.

The latter follows from Increasing Sequence in Ordered Set Terminates iff Maximal Element.

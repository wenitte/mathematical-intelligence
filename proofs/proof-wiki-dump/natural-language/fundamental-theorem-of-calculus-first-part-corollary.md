Corollary to Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (First Part)
Let $f$ be a real function which is continuous on the closed interval $\closedint a b$.
Let $F$ be a real function which is defined on $\closedint a b$ by:

$\ds \map F x = \int_a^x \map f t \rd t$

Then:

$\ds \frac \d {\d x} \int_a^x \map f t \rd t = \map f x$


Proof
Follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (First Part) and the definition of primitive.
$\blacksquare$

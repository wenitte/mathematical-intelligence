Corollary to Induced Group Product is Homomorphism iff Commutative
Let $\struct {G, \circ}$ be a group.
Let $\phi: G \times G \to G$ be defined such that:

$\forall a, b \in G: \map \phi {a, b} = a \circ b$

Then $\phi$ is a homomorphism if and only if $G$ is abelian.


Proof
We have that $G$ is a subgroup of itself.

The result then follows from Induced Group Product is Homomorphism iff Commutative by putting $H_1 = H_2 = G$.
$\blacksquare$

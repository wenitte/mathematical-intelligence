Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be a finite semigroup.
Let $a \in S$ be right cancellable.

Then the right regular representation $\rho_a$ of $\struct {S, \circ}$ with respect to $a$ is a bijection.


Proof
By Right Cancellable iff Right Regular Representation Injective, $\rho_a$ is an injection.
By hypothesis, $S$ is finite.
From Injection from Finite Set to Itself is Surjection, $\rho_a$ is a surjection.
Thus $\rho_a$ is injective and surjective, and therefore a bijection.
$\blacksquare$

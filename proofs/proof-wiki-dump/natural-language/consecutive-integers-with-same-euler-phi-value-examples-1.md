Example of Consecutive Integers with Same Euler Phi Value
Let $\phi: \Z_{>0} \to \Z_{>0}$ denote the Euler $\phi$ function: the number of strictly positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which are prime to $n$.
Then:

$\map \phi 1 = \map \phi 2 = 1$


Proof
From Euler Phi Function of 1:

$\map \phi 1 = 1$
From Euler Phi Function of Prime:

$\map \phi 2 = 2 - 1 = 1$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

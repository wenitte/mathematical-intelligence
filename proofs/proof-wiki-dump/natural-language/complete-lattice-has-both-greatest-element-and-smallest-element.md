Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a complete lattice.

Then:

$(\text{1}) \quad \struct{S, \preceq}$ has a smallest element, namely:
$\quad \bot := \sup \O$
$(\text{2}) \quad \struct{S, \preceq}$ has a greatest element, namely:
$\quad \top := \inf \O$


Proof
From Complete Lattice is Bounded:

$\struct{S, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ is a bounded lattice
From Bounded Lattice has Both Greatest Element and Smallest Element:

$(\text{1}) \quad \struct{S, \preceq}$ has a smallest element, namely:
$\quad \bot := \sup \O$
$(\text{2}) \quad \struct{S, \preceq}$ has a greatest element, namely:
$\quad \top := \inf \O$
$\blacksquare$

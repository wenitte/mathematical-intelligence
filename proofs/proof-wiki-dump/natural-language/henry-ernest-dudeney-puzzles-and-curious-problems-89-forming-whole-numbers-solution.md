Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $89$
Forming Whole Numbers
Can the reader give the sum of all the whole numbers that can be formed with the four figures $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$?
That is, the addition of all such numbers as $1234$, $1423$, $4312$, etc.
You can, of course, write them all out and make the addition,
but the interest lies in finding a very simple rule for the sum of all the numbers that can be made with $4$ different digits selected in every possible way, but $0$ excluded.


Solution
$66 \, 660$


Proof
There are $24$ permutations of $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$.
Of these permutations, each digit appears in each of the $4$ positions $6$ times each.
Let $S$ be the required sum.
We have:














\(\ds S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \times \paren {1 + 2 + 3 + 4}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds + \, \)

\(\ds 6 \times \paren {10 + 20 + 30 + 40}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds + \, \)

\(\ds 6 \times \paren {100 + 200 + 300 + 400}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds + \, \)

\(\ds 6 \times \paren {1000 + 2000 + 3000 + 4000}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \times \paren {10 + 100 + 1000 + 10 \, 000}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 66 \, 660\)

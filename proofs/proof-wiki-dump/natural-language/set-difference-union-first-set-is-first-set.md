Theorem
The union of a set difference with the first set is the set itself:

Let $S, T$ be sets.

Then:

$\paren {S \setminus T} \cup S = S$


Proof
Consider $S, T \subseteq \mathbb U$, where $\mathbb U$ is considered as the universal set.














\(\ds \paren {S \setminus T} \cup S\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {S \cap \map \complement T} \cup S\)





Set Difference as Intersection with Complement














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds S\)





Union Absorbs Intersection



$\blacksquare$

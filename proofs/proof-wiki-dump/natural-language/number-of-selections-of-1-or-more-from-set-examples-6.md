Example of Use of Number of Selections of $1$ or More from Set
Let there be $6$ different flowers in a vase.
Then there are $63$ different ways of selecting at least one of these flowers.


Proof
Let $S$ be the set of flowers.
Let $N$ be the number of different ways of selecting at least one of these flowers.

We have:

$\card S = 6$
where $\card S$ denotes the cardinality of $S$.
Hence from Number of Selections of $1$ or More from Set:

$N = 2^6 - 1 = 63$
$\blacksquare$

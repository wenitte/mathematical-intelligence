Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If the sides of the opposite planes of a cube be bisected, and planes be carried through the points of section the common section of the planes and the diameter of the cube bisect one another.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XI}$: Proposition $38$)


Proof

Let $AF$ be a cube.
Let the edges of the opposite faces $CF$ and $AH$ of $AF$ be bisected at the points $K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R$.
Let the plane $KN$ be constructed through $K, L, M, N$.
Let the plane $OR$ be constructed through $O, P, Q, R$.
Let $US$ be the common section of $KN$ and $OR$.
Let $DG$ be the diameter of the cube $AF$.
It is to be demonstrated that:

$UT = TS$
$DT = TG$

Let $DU, UE, BS, SG$ be joined.
We have that $DO$ is parallel to $PE$.
Therefore from Proposition $29$ of Book $\text{I} $: Parallelism implies Equal Alternate Angles:

$\angle DOU = \angle UPE$
We have that:

$DO = PE$
$OU = UP$
$\angle DOU = \angle UPE$
So from Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{I} $: Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence:

$\triangle DOU = \triangle PUE$
Therefore:

$\angle OUD = \angle PUE$
So from Proposition $14$ of Book $\text{I} $: Two Angles making Two Right Angles make Straight Line:

$DUE$ is a straight line.

This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: The statement above does not follow from the result stated -- this needs to be checked.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
For the same reason:

$BSG$ is a straight line.
and:

$BS = SG$
We have that:

$CA = DB$ and $CA \parallel DB$
and:

$CA = EG$ and $CA \parallel EG$
Therefore fromProposition $9$ of Book $\text{I} $: Lines Parallel to Same Line not in Same Plane are Parallel to each other:

$DB = EG$ and $DB \parallel EG$
We have that the straight lines $DE$ and $BG$ join the endpoints of $DB$ and $EG$.
Therefore from Proposition $33$ of Book $\text{I} $: Lines Joining Equal and Parallel Straight Lines are Parallel:

$DE \parallel BG$
Therefore from Proposition $29$ of Book $\text{I} $: Parallelism implies Equal Alternate Angles:

$\angle EDT = \angle BGT$
Therefore from Proposition $29$ of Book $\text{I} $: Two Straight Lines make Equal Opposite Angles:

$\angle DTU = \angle GTS$
Therefore from Proposition $26$ of Book $\text{I} $: Triangle Side-Angle-Angle Congruence:

$\triangle DTU = \triangle GTS$
Therefore:

$DT = TG$
and

$UT = TS$
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $38$ of Book $\text{XI}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

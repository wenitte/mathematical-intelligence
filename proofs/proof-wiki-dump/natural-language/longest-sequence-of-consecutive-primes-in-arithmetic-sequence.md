Sequence
The longest known sequence of consecutive prime numbers in arithmetic sequence starts at $121 \, 174 \, 811$, has a length of $6$ and a common difference of $30$:

$121 \, 174 \, 811, 121 \, 174 \, 841, 121 \, 174 \, 871, 121 \, 174 \, 901, 121 \, 174 \, 931, 121 \, 174 \, 961$
This sequence is A081734 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (N. J. A. Sloane (Ed.), 2008).


Proof













\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 811 + 0 \times 30\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 811\)





which is the $6 \, 904 \, 737$th prime














\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 811 + 1 \times 30\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 841\)





which is the $6 \, 904 \, 738$th prime














\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 811 + 2 \times 30\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 871\)





which is the $6 \, 904 \, 739$th prime














\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 811 + 3 \times 30\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 901\)





which is the $6 \, 904 \, 740$th prime














\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 811 + 4 \times 30\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 931\)





which is the $6 \, 904 \, 741$st prime














\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 811 + 5 \times 30\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 121 \, 174 \, 961\)





which is the $6 \, 904 \, 742$nd prime




But note that $121 \, 174 \, 811 + 6 \times 30 = 121 \, 174 \, 991 = 7^2 \times 2 \, 472 \, 959$ and so is not prime.

Inspection of tables of primes (or a computer search) will reveal that no longer such sequences are known.

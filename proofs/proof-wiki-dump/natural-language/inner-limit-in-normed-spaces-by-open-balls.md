Theorem
Let $\sequence {C_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ be a sequence of sets in a normed vector space $\struct {\XX, \norm {\, \cdot \,} }$.

Then the inner limit of $\sequence {C_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ is:

$\ds \liminf_n C_n = \set {x: \forall \epsilon > 0: \exists N \in \NN_\infty: \forall n \in N: x \in C_n + B_\epsilon}$
where $B_\epsilon$ denotes the open $\epsilon$-ball of the space.


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: What are $N$ and $\NN_\infty$ in this context? Also, what point is at the center of $B$? And what does $C_n + \epsilon B$ mean? For the latter one suspects $\cup$, but this needs to be checked. This page might need to be rewritten from a new perspective, as the original author was touchy about symbols used and departed $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ in a rage when his notation was changed.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.
Proof
The proof is an immediate result of Inner Limit in Hausdorff Space by Open Neighborhoods since the arbitrary open sets can be here replaced by open balls.
$\blacksquare$

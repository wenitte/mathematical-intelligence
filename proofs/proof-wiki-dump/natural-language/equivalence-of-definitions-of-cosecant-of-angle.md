Theorem
Let $\theta$ be an angle.

The following definitions of the concept of cosecant are equivalent:

Definition from Triangle

In the above right triangle, we are concerned about the angle $\theta$.
The cosecant of $\angle \theta$ is defined as being $\dfrac {\text {Hypotenuse}} {\text {Opposite}}$.

Definition from Circle
Consider a unit circle $C$ whose center is at the origin of a cartesian plane.




Let $P$ be the point on $C$ in the first quadrant such that $\theta$ is the angle made by $OP$ with the $x$-axis.
Let a tangent line be drawn to touch $C$ at $A = \tuple {0, 1}$.
Let $OP$ be produced to meet this tangent line at $B$.

Then the cosecant of $\theta$ is defined as the length of $OB$.
Hence in the first quadrant, the cosecant is positive.



Proof
Definition from Triangle implies Definition from Circle
Let $\csc \theta$ be defined as $\dfrac {\text{Hypotenuse}} {\text{Opposite}}$ in a right triangle.
Consider the triangle $\triangle OAB$.
By construction, $\angle OAB$ is a right angle.

From Parallelism implies Equal Alternate Angles:

$\angle OBA = \theta$
Thus:














\(\ds \csc \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {OB} {OA}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {OB} 1\)





as $OA$ is the radius of the unit circle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds OB\)









That is:

$\csc \theta = OB$
$\Box$


Definition from Circle implies Definition from Triangle
Let $\csc \theta$ be defined as the length of $OB$ in the triangle $\triangle OAB$.
Compare $\triangle OAB$ with $\triangle ABC$ in the diagram above.
From Parallelism implies Equal Alternate Angles:

$\angle OBA = \theta$
We have that:

$\angle CAB = \angle OBA = \theta$
$\angle ABC = \angle OAB$ which is a right angle
Therefore by Triangles with Two Equal Angles are Similar it follows that $\triangle OAB$ and $\triangle ABC$ are similar.
By definition of similarity:














\(\ds \frac {\text{Hypotenuse} } {\text{Opposite} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {AC} {BC}\)





by definition














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {OB} {OA}\)





Definition of Similar Triangles














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds OB\)





as $OA$ is the radius of the unit circle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \csc \theta\)





by definition



That is:

$\dfrac {\text{Hypotenuse} } {\text{Opposite} } = \csc \theta$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
There exists at least one example of a completely normal topological space which is not perfectly normal.


Proof
Let $T$ be an uncountable Fort space.

From Fort Space is Completely Normal, $T$ is a completely normal space.
From Uncountable Fort Space is not Perfectly Normal, $T$ is not a perfectly normal space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function defined on an interval $I$.
Let $a$ be a point in $I$ where $f$ is left- and right-hand differentiable.

Then $f$ is continuous at $a$.


Proof
By Left-Hand Differentiable Function is Left-Continuous, $f$ is left-continuous at $a$.
By Right-Hand Differentiable Function is Right-Continuous, $f$ is right-continuous at $a$.
By Continuous at Point iff Left-Continuous and Right-Continuous, $f$ is continuous at $a$.
$\blacksquare$

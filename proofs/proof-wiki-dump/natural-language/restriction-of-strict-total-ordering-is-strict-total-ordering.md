Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \prec}$ be a strict total ordering.
Let $T \subseteq S$.
Let $\prec \restriction_T$ be the restriction of $\prec$ to $T$.

Then $\prec \restriction_T$ is a strict total ordering of $T$.


Proof
By definition of strict total ordering, $\prec$ is:

$(1): \quad$ a relation which is transitive and antireflexive
$(2): \quad$ a relation which is connected.
By Reflexive Reduction of Transitive Antisymmetric Relation is Strict Ordering:

$\prec \restriction_T$ is a strict ordering.
It follows from Restriction of Connected Relation is Connected that:

$\prec \restriction_T$ is connected.

Thus $\prec \restriction_T$ is a strict ordering which is connected.
So by definition $\prec \restriction_T$ is a strict total ordering of $T$.
$\blacksquare$

Corollary to Law of Inverses (Modulo Arithmetic)
Let $m, n \in \Z$ such that:

$m \perp n$
that is, such that $m$ and $n$ are coprime.

Then:

$\exists n' \in \Z: n n' \equiv 1 \pmod m$


Proof
By definition of coprime:

$m \perp n \iff \gcd \set {m, n} = 1$
The result follows directly from Law of Inverses (Modulo Arithmetic).
$\blacksquare$

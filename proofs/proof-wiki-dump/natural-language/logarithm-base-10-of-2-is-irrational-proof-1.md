Theorem
The common logarithm of $2$:

$\log_{10} 2 \approx 0.30102 \, 99956 \, 63981 \, 19521 \, 37389 \ldots$
is irrational.


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $\log_{10} 2$ is rational.
Then:














\(\ds \log_{10} 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac p q\)





for some $p, q \in \Z_{\ne 0}$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10^{p / q}\)





Definition of General Logarithm








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 2^q\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10^p\)





raising both sides to the power of $q$



Both $10^p$ and $2^q$ are integers, by construction.
But $10^p$ is divisible by $5$, while $2^p$, which has only $2$ as a prime factor, is not.
So $10^p \ne 2^q$.
So, by Proof by Contradiction, it follows that $\log_{10} 2$ is irrational.

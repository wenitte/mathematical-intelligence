Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \tau_{_S}}$ be a topological space.
Let $\struct{R, +, *, \norm{\,\cdot\,}}$ be a normed division ring.
Let $\tau_{_R}$ be the topology induced by the norm $\norm{\,\cdot\,}$.

Let $g : \struct{S, \tau_{_S}} \to \struct{R, \tau_{_R}}$ be a continuous mapping.

Let $- g : S \to R$ be the mapping defined by:

$\forall x \in S: \map {\paren{- g}} x = - \map g x$

Then 

$- g : \struct{S, \tau_{_S}} \to \struct{R, \tau_{_R}}$ is continuous.


Proof
From Corollary to Normed Division Ring Operations are Continuous, $\struct{R, +, *, \tau_{_R}}$ is a topological division ring.
From Negation Rule for Continuous Mappings to Topological Division Ring, $- g : \struct{S, \tau_{_S}} \to \struct{R, \tau_{_R}}$ is a continuous mapping.
$\blacksquare$

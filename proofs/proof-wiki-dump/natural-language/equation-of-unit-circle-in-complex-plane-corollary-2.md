Corollary to Equation of Unit Circle in Complex Plane
Consider the unit circle $C$ whose center is at $\left({0, 0}\right)$ on the complex plane.

The equation of $C$ can be given by:

$\overline z = \dfrac 1 z$
where $\overline z$ denotes the complex conjugate of $z$.


Proof
From Equation of Unit Circle in Complex Plane: Corollary 1, the equation of $C$ can also be given by:

$z \overline z = 1$
The result follows by multiplying by $\dfrac 1 z$.
$\blacksquare$

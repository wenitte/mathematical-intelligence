Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a spherical triangle on the surface of a sphere whose center is $O$.
Let the sides $a, b, c$ of $\triangle ABC$ be measured by the angles subtended at $O$, where $a, b, c$ are opposite $A, B, C$ respectively.

Let the angles $\sphericalangle A$ and $\sphericalangle B$ be known.
Let the side $b$ also be known.
Then it may not be possible to know the value of $a$.


Proof
From the Spherical Law of Sines, we have:

$\dfrac {\sin a} {\sin A} = \dfrac {\sin b} {\sin B} = \dfrac {\sin c} {\sin C}$
from which:

$\sin a = \dfrac {\sin b \sin A} {\sin B}$
We find that $0 < \sin a \le 1$.
We have that:

$\sin a = \map \sin {\pi - a}$
and so unless $\sin a = 1$ and so $a = \dfrac \pi 2$, it is not possible to tell which of $a$ or $\pi - a$ provides the correct solution.
$\blacksquare$

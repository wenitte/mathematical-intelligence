Examples of First Supplement to Law of Quadratic Reciprocity
$-1$ is a quadratic non-residue of $11$.


Proof
From Quadratic Residues of 11:

the set of quadratic residues modulo $11$ is:
$\set {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}$
but not $10 \equiv -1 \pmod {11}$.

We also have that:

$11 = 4 \times 3 - 1$
and so is not of the form $4 n + 1$.
$\blacksquare$

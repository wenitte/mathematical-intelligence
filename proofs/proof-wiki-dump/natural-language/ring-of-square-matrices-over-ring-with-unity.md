Theorem
Let $R$ be a ring with unity.
Let $n \in \Z_{>0}$ be a (strictly) positive integer.
Let $\struct {\map {\MM_R} n, +, \times}$ denote the ring of square matrices of order $n$ over $R$.

Then $\struct {\map {\MM_R} n, +, \times}$ is a ring with unity.


Proof
From Ring of Square Matrices over Ring is Ring we have that $\struct {\map {\MM_R} n, +, \times}$ is a ring.
As $R$ has a unity, the unit matrix can be formed.
The unity of $\struct {\map {\MM_R} n, +, \times}$ is this unit matrix.
$\blacksquare$


Notation
When referring to the operation of matrix multiplication in the context of the ring of square matrices:

$\struct {\map {\MM_R} n, +, \times}$
we must have some symbol to represent it, and $\times$ does as well as any.
However, we do not use $\mathbf A \times \mathbf B$ for matrix multiplication $\mathbf A \mathbf B$, as it is understood to mean the vector cross product, which is something completely different.

Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $x, y \in S$ such that

$x \preceq y$

Then $x^\ll \subseteq y^\ll$
where $x^\ll$ denotes the way below closure of $x$.


Proof
Let $z \in x^\ll$.
By definition of way below closure:

$z \ll x$
By Preceding and Way Below implies Way Below and definition of reflexivity:

$z \ll y$
Thus by definition of way below closure:

$z \in y^\ll$
$\blacksquare$

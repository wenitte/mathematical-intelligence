Theorem
Let a radioactive element $S$ decay with a rate constant $k$.
Then its half-life $T$ is given by:

$T = \dfrac {\ln 2} k$





Proof
Let $x_0$ be the quantity of $S$ at time $t = 0$.
At time $t = T$ the quantity of $S$ has been reduced to $x = \dfrac {x_0} 2$.
This gives:














\(\ds x_0 e^{-k T}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {x_0} 2\)





First-Order Reaction

\(\ds e^{k T}\)

\(\ds 2\)

\(\ds \frac {\ln 2} k\)

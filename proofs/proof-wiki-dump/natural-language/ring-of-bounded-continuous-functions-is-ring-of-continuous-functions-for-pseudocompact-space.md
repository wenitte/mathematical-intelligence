Theorem
Let $\struct {K, \tau}$ be a pseudocompact space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $\struct {\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$ be the ring of continuous real-valued functions from $S$.
Let $\struct {\map {C^*} {S, \R}, +, *}$ be the ring of bounded continuous real-valued functions from $S$.

Then:

$\struct {\map {C^*} {S, \R}, +, *} = \struct {\map C {S, \R}, +, *}$


Proof
Follows immediately from the definitions of:

Definition:Pseudocompact Space
Definition:Ring of Continuous Real-Valued Functions
Definition:Ring of Bounded Continuous Real-Valued Functions
$\blacksquare$

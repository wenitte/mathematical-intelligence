Theorem
Let $m$ and $n$ be finite ordinals.
Let $m \ne 0$, where $0$ is the zero ordinal.
Let $x$ be a limit ordinal.

Then:

$m \times \paren {x + n} = x + \paren {m \times n}$

This article is complete as far as it goes, but it could do with expansion.In particular: Via Cantor normal form, all ordinals are of the form $x + n$You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by adding this information.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Expand}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
Proof
Lemma
Let $m$ be a finite ordinal.
Let $m \ne 0$, where $0$ is the zero ordinal.

Then:

$m \times \omega = \omega$
where $\omega$ denotes the minimally inductive set.
$\Box$

By Ordinal Multiplication is Left Distributive:

$m \times \paren {x + n} = \paren {m \times x} + \paren {m \times n}$

It remains to prove that $x = m \times x$.

Since $x$ is a limit ordinal, it follows that:

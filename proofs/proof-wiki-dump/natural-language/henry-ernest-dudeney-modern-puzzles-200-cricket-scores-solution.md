Cricket Scores
In a country match Great Muddleton, who went in first, made a score of which they were proud.
Then Little Wurzleford had their innings and scored a quarter less.
The Muddletonians in their next attempt made a quarter less than their opponents,
who, curiously enough, were only rewarded on their second attempt by a quarter less than their last score.
Thus, every innings was a quarter less fruitful in runs than the one that preceded it.
Yet the Muddletonians won the match by $50$ runs.
Can you give the exact score for every one of the four innings?


Solution













\(\ds \text {Great Muddleton's $1$st innings}\)

\(:\)







\(\ds 128\)




















\(\ds \text {Little Wurzleford's $1$st innings}\)

\(:\)







\(\ds 96\)




















\(\ds \text {Great Muddleton's $2$nd innings}\)

\(:\)







\(\ds 72\)




















\(\ds \text {Little Wurzleford's $2$nd innings}\)

\(:\)







\(\ds 54\)











Proof
Let $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ be Great Muddleton's first innings' score, Little Wurzleford's first innings' score, Great Muddleton's second innings' score and Little Wurzleford's second innings' score respectively.
Then:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a - \dfrac a 4\)

\(\ds = \dfrac {3 a} 4\)



Then Little Wurzleford had their innings and scored a quarter less.




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds b - \dfrac b 4\)

\(\ds = \dfrac {9 a} {16}\)



The Muddletonians in their next attempt made a quarter less than their opponents,




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds d\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c - \dfrac c 4\)

\(\ds = \dfrac {27 a} {64}\)



who, curiously enough, were only rewarded on their second attempt by a quarter less than their last score.




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)









\(\ds a + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 50 + b + d\)





Yet the Muddletonians won the match by $50$ runs.








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a + \dfrac {9 a} {16}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 50 + \dfrac {3 a} 4 + \dfrac {27 a} {64}\)





substituting for $b$, $c$ and $d$ from $(1)$, $(2)$ and $(3)$ in $(4)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {64 a} {64} + \dfrac {36 a} {64}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 50 + \dfrac {48 a} {64} + \dfrac {27 a} {64}\)





putting everything over a common denominator








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 64 a + 36 a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3200 + 48 a + 27 a\)





multiplying both sides by $64$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 128\)





simplifying



The rest of the scores fall to simple arithmetic.
$\blacksquare$

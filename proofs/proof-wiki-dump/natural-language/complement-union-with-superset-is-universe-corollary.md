Corollary to Complement Union with Superset is Universe
$S \cup T = \mathbb U \iff \map \complement S \subseteq T$
where:

$S \subseteq T$ denotes that $S$ is a subset of $T$
$S \cup T$ denotes the union of $S$ and $T$
$\complement$ denotes set complement
$\mathbb U$ denotes the universal set.


Proof
Let $X = \map \complement S$.
Then:














\(\ds X \subseteq T\)

\(\iff\)







\(\ds \map \complement X \cup T = \mathbb U\)





Complement Union with Superset is Universe








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map \complement S \subseteq T\)

\(\iff\)







\(\ds \map \complement {\map \complement S} \cup T = \mathbb U\)





substituting $X = \map \complement S$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \map \complement S \subseteq T\)

\(\iff\)







\(\ds S \cup T = \mathbb U\)

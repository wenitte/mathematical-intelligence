Example of Injection
Let $f: \R \to \R$ be the real function defined as:

$\forall x \in \R: \map f x = x^3$
Then $f$ is an injection.


Proof
From Odd Power Function on Real Numbers is Strictly Increasing, $f$ is strictly increasing.
From Strictly Monotone Real Function is Bijective, it follows that $f$ is bijective.
Hence by definition $f$ is an injection.
$\blacksquare$

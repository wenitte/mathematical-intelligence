Theorem
Let $a \in \R$ be a real number such that $a > 1$.
Let $f: \Z \to \R$ be the real-valued function defined as:

$\map f k = a^k$
where $a^k$ denotes $a$ to the power of $k$.

Then $f$ is strictly decreasing.


Proof
Let $a > 1$.
By Power Function on Base Greater than One is Strictly Increasing: Positive Integer, the theorem is already proven for positive integers.
It remains to be proven over the strictly negative integers.

Let $i, j$ be integers such that $i < j < 0$.

From Order of Real Numbers is Dual of Order of their Negatives:

$0 < -j < -i$
So:














\(\ds a^{-j}\)

\(<\)







\(\ds a^{-i}\)

\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac 1 {a^j}\)

\(\ds \frac 1 {a^i}\)

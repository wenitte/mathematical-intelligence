Theorem
$S \setminus \paren {S \setminus T} = S \cap T = T \setminus \paren {T \setminus S}$


Proof













\(\ds S \setminus \paren {S \setminus T}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {S \setminus S} \cup \paren {S \cap T}\)





Set Difference with Set Difference is Union of Set Difference with Intersection














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \O \cup \paren {S \cap T}\)





Set Difference with Self is Empty Set














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds S \cap T\)





Union with Empty Set




Interchanging $S$ and $T$:














\(\ds T \setminus \paren {T \setminus S}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds T \cap S\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds S \cap T\)





Intersection is Commutative



$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $X, Y$ be sets.
Let:

$\card X = \card Y$
where $\card X$ denotes the cardinality of $X$.

If $X$ is countable then $Y$ is countable.


Proof
Assume that $X$ is countable.
By definition of countable set there exists an injection:L

$f: X \to \N$
By definition of cardinality the sets $Y$ and $X$ are equivalent:

$Y \sim X$
Then by definition of set equivalence there exists a bijection:

$g: Y \to X$
By definition of bijection:

$g$ is an injection.
Hence by Composite of Injections is Injection:

$f \circ g: Y \to \N$ is an injection.
Thus by definition:

$Y$ is countable.
$\blacksquare$

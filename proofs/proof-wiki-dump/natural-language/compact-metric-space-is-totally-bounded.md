Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space which is compact.
Then $M$ is totally bounded.


Proof
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be compact.
Let $\epsilon > 0$.
Then the family $\set {\map {B_\epsilon} x: x \in A}$ of open $\epsilon$-balls forms an open cover of $A$.
By the definition of compact, there exists a finite subcover.
That is, there are points $x_0, \ldots, x_n$ such that:

$\ds A = \bigcup_{0 \mathop \le i \mathop \le n} \map {B_\epsilon} {x_i}$
as required. 
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ be cuts.
Let the operation of $\alpha + \gamma$ be the sum of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$.
Let $0^*$ denote the rational cut associated with the (rational) number $0$.

If:

$\alpha > 0^*$ and $\gamma > 0^*$
then:

$\alpha + \gamma > 0^*$
where $>$ denotes the strict ordering on cuts.


Proof
From Ordering on Cuts is Compatible with Addition of Cuts

$0^* + 0^* < 0^* + \alpha$
$\alpha + 0^* < \alpha + \gamma$
The result follows from Ordering on Cuts is Transitive.
$\blacksquare$

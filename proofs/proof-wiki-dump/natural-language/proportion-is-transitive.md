Theorem
Proportion is a transitive relation.
That is:

$\forall x, y, z \in \R: x \propto y \land y \propto z \implies x \propto z$


Proof
Let $x, y, z$ be arbitrary.
Let $x$ be proportional to $y$ and $y$ to $z$:

$x \propto y \land y \propto z$
Then by definition:

$\exists j, k \ne 0: x = j \times y \land y = k \times z$
Substituting $k \times z$ for $y$:

$x = \paren {j \times k} \times z$
so $j \times k$ is the desired constant of proportion.
The result follows from the definition of transitivity and proportion.

Theorem
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a sequence in $\R$.

Then $\sequence {x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence if and only if $\sequence {x_n}$ is convergent.


Proof
Necessary Condition
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a sequence in $\R$.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be convergent.

Then $\sequence {x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.
$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a sequence in $\R$.
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a Cauchy sequence.

Then $\sequence {x_n}$ is convergent.
$\Box$

The conditions are shown to be equivalent.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Cauchy's Convergence Criterion is also known as the Cauchy Convergence Condition.

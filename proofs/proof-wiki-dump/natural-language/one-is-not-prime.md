Theorem
The integer $1$ (one) is not a prime number.


Proof 1
By definition, a prime number is a positive integer which has exactly $2$ divisors which are themselves positive integers.
From Divisors of One, the only divisors of $1$ are $1$ and $-1$.
So the only divisor of $1$ which is a positive integer is $1$.
As $1$ has only one such divisor, it is not classified as a prime number.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
From Divisor Sum of Prime Number, the sum $\map {\sigma_1} p$ of all the positive integer divisors of a prime number $p$ is $p + 1$.
But from Divisor Sum of 1, $\map {\sigma_1} 1 = 1$.
If $1$ were to be classified as prime, then $\map {\sigma_1} 1$ would be an exception to the rule that $\map {\sigma_1} p = p + 1$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
$S \cap \paren {S \cup T} = S$


Proof 1













\(\ds \)

\(\)







\(\ds S \subseteq \paren {S \cup T}\)





Set is Subset of Union














\(\ds \)

\(\leadsto\)







\(\ds S \cap \paren {S \cup T} = S\)





Intersection with Subset is Subset‎



$\blacksquare$


Proof 2













\(\ds x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds S \cap \paren {S \cup T}\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds S \land \paren {x \in S \lor x \in T}\)





Definition of Set Intersection and Definition of Set Union








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds S\)





Conjunction Absorbs Disjunction



$\blacksquare$


Also see
Union Absorbs Intersection, where it is proved that $S \cup \paren {S \cap T} = S$
These two results together are known as the Absorption Laws, corresponding to the equivalent results in logic.

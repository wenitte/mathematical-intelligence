Definition
Let $S$ be a cord of length $a$ situated as a (straight) line segment whose endpoints are $P$ and $T$.
Let $S$ be aligned along the $y$-axis of a cartesian plane with $T$ at the origin and $P$ therefore at the point $\tuple {0, a}$.
Let $T$ be dragged along the $x$-axis.

The equation of the tractrix along which $P$ travels can be expressed in parametric form as:














\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \paren {\ln \cot \dfrac \theta 2 - \cos \theta}\)




















\(\ds y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \sin \theta\)











Proof
Consider $P$ when it is at the point $\tuple {x, y}$.




Consider the upper part of the tractrix.
The cord $S$ is tangent to the locus of $P$.
Let the angle formed by cord $S$ and the $x$-axis be $\theta$.
Then $y = a \sin \theta$.
Substituting this into the Cartesian Form of the equation of the tractrix:














\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \, \map \ln {\frac {a + \sqrt {a^2 - y^2} } y} - \sqrt {a^2 - y^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \, \map \ln {\frac {a + \sqrt {a^2 - \paren {a \sin \theta}^2} } {a \sin \theta} } - \sqrt {a^2 - \paren {a \sin \theta}^2}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \, \map \ln {\frac {a + a \cos \theta} {a \sin \theta} } - a \cos \theta\)





Sum of Squares of Sine and Cosine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \, \map \ln {\frac 1 {\tan \theta/2} } - a \cos \theta\)





Half Angle Formula for Tangent: Corollary $1$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \paren {\ln \cot \frac \theta 2 - \cos \theta}\)

Linguistic Note
The word tractrix derives from the Latin traho (trahere, traxi, tractum) meaning to pull or to drag.
The plural is tractrices.

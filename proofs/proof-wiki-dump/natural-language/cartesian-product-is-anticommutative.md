Theorem
Let $S, T \ne \O$.

Then:

$S \times T = T \times S \iff S = T$


Corollary
$S \times T = T \times S \iff S = T \lor S = \O \lor T = \O$


Proof
Suppose $S \times T = T \times S$.
Then:














\(\ds x \in S\)

\(\land\)







\(\ds y \in T\)














\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds \tuple {x, y}\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds S \times T\)





Definition of Cartesian Product








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds \tuple {x, y}\)

\(\ds T \times S\)





by hypothesis








\(\ds \leadstoandfrom \ \ \)





\(\ds x \in T\)

\(\land\)







\(\ds y \in S\)





Definition of Cartesian Product



Thus it can be seen from the definition of set equality that $S \times T = T \times S \iff S = T$.

Note that if $S = \O$ or $T = \O$ then, from Cartesian Product is Empty iff Factor is Empty, $S \times T = T \times S = \O$ whatever $S$ and $T$ are, and the result does not hold.

Example of Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime
$\map {\sigma_1} {362} = 546$


Proof
We have that:

$362 = 2 \times 181$
and so by definition is a semiprime whose prime factors are distinct.

Hence:














\(\ds \map {\sigma_1} {362}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {2 + 1} \paren {181 + 1}\)





Divisor Sum of Non-Square Semiprime














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times 182\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \times \paren {2 \times 7 \times 13}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 546\)









$\blacksquare$

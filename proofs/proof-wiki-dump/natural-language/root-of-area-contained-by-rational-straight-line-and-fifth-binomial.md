Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the fifth binomial, the "side" of the area is the irrational straight line called the side of a rational plus a medial area.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $58$)


Proof

Let the rectangular area $ABCD$ be contained by the rational straight line $AB$ and the fifth binomial $AD$.
Let $E$ divide $AD$ into its terms such that $AE > ED$.
From Proposition $42$ of Book $\text{X} $: Binomial Straight Line is Divisible into Terms Uniquely this is possible at only one place.
By definition of binomial, $AE$ and $ED$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
Thus $AE^2$ is greater than $ED^2$ by the square on a straight line which is commensurable with $AE$.
Let $ED$ be bisected at $F$.
Using Proposition $29$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Construction of Parallelogram Equal to Given Figure Exceeding a Parallelogram:

Let a parallelogram be applied to $AE$ equal to $EF^2$ and deficient by a square.
Let the rectangle contained by $AG$ and $GE$ equal to $EF^2$ be applied to $AE$.
By Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{X} $: Condition for Commensurability of Roots of Quadratic Equation:

$AG$ is commensurable in length with $EG$.
Let $GH$, $EK$ and $FL$ be drawn from $G$, $E$ and $F$ parallel to $AB$ and $CD$.
Using Proposition $14$ of Book $\text{II} $: Construction of Square equal to Given Polygon:

let the square $SN$ be constructed equal to the parallelogram $AH$
and:

let the square $NQ$ be constructed equal to the parallelogram $GK$.
Let $SN$ and $NQ$ be placed so that $MN$ is in a straight line with $NO$.
Therefore $RN$ is also in a straight line with $NP$.
Let the parallelogram $SQ$ be completed.
From Lemma to Proposition $54$ of Book $\text{X} $: Root of Area contained by Rational Straight Line and First Binomial:

$SQ$ is a square.
We have that $AD$ is a third binomial straight line.
Therefore $AE$ and $ED$ are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only.
We have that the rectangle contained by $AG$ and $GE$ is equal to $EF^2$.
Then by Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Rectangles Contained by Three Proportional Straight Lines:

$AG : EF = EF : EG$
and so by Proposition $1$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Areas of Triangles and Parallelograms Proportional to Base:

$AH : EL = EL : KG$
Therefore $EL$ is a mean proportional between $AH$ and $GK$.
But:

$AH = SN$
and:

$GK = NQ$
therefore $EL$ is a mean proportional between $SN$ and $NQ$.
But from Lemma to Proposition $54$ of Book $\text{X} $: Root of Area contained by Rational Straight Line and First Binomial:

$MR$ is a mean proportional between $SN$ and $NQ$.
Therefore:

$EL = MR$
and so:

$EL = PO$
But:

$AH + GK = SN + NQ$
Therefore:

$AC = SQ$
That is:

$AC$ is an area contained by a rational straight line $AB$ and the first binomial $AD$, while the side of the area $SQ$ is $MO$.

From Proposition $18$ of Book $\text{X} $: Condition for Incommensurability of Roots of Quadratic Equation:

$AE$ is incommensurable in length with $AD$.
By:

Proposition $1$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Areas of Triangles and Parallelograms Proportional to Base
and:

Proposition $11$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability of Elements of Proportional Magnitudes
it follows that:

$AH$ is commensurable with $HE$.
That is:

$MN^2$ is incommensurable with $NO^2$.
Therefore $MN$ and $NO$ are incommensurable in square.

We have that $AD$ is a fifth binomial with $ED$ the lesser segment.
Therefore by Book $\text{X (II)}$ Definition $5$: Fifth Binomial:

$ED$ is commensurable in length with $AB$.
But $AE$ is incommensurable in length with $ED$.
Therefore by Proposition $13$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurable Magnitudes are Incommensurable with Same Magnitude

$AB$ is incommensurable in length with $AE$.
Therefore, by definition, $AK = MN^2 + NO^2$ is medial.
We have that:

$DE$ is commensurable in length with $AB = EK$
and:

$DE$ is commensurable in length with $EF$.
So by Proposition $12$ of Book $\text{X} $: Commensurability is Transitive Relation:

$EF$ is commensurable in length with $EK$.
We have that $EK$ is a rational straight line.
Therefore by Proposition $19$ of Book $\text{X} $: Product of Rationally Expressible Numbers is Rational:

$EL = MR = MN \cdot NO$ is a rational area.
Therefore $MN$ and $NO$ are straight lines which are incommensurable in square such that:

$MN^2 + NO^2$ is medial
$MN \cdot NO$ is rational.
Therefore by definition, $MO$ is the side of a rational plus a medial area.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $58$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $64$: Square on Side of Rational plus Medial Area applied to Rational Straight Line.

Theorem
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a locally connected topological space.
Let $G$ be a component of $T$.

Then $G$ is open.


Proof
By definition of locally connected space, $T$ has a basis of connected sets in $T$.
Thus $S$ is a union of open connected sets in $T$.
By Components are Open iff Union of Open Connected Sets, the components of $T$ are open.
$\blacksquare$

Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
Blessed Zeus, are these deeds pleasing in thy sight that the Thessalian women do in play?
The eye of the moon is blighted by mortals; I saw it myself.
The night still wanted till morning twice two-sixths and twice one-seventh of what was past.


Solution
Let $t$ be the time since sunset.
It is assumed that the night is $12$ hours long.

We have:














\(\ds 12 - t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times \dfrac {2 t} 6 + \dfrac {2 t} 7\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 21 \times 12 - 21 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 14 t + 6 t\)





multiplying through by $42$ to clear the fractions








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 21 \times 12\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 41 t\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {252} {41}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \frac 6 {41}\)










So $6 \frac 6 {41}$ hours have passed since sunset.
That leaves $12 - 6 \frac 6 {41} = 5 \frac {35} {41}$ hours remaining till sunrise.
$\blacksquare$

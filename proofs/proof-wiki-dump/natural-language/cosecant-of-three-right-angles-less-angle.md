Theorem
$\map \csc {\dfrac {3 \pi} 2 - \theta} = -\sec \theta$
where $\csc$ and $\sec$ are cosecant and secant respectively.


Proof













\(\ds \map \csc {\frac {3 \pi} 2 - \theta}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {\map \sin {\frac {3 \pi} 2 - \theta} }\)





Cosecant is Reciprocal of Sine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac 1 {-\cos \theta}\)





Sine of Three Right Angles less Angle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\sec \theta\)





Secant is Reciprocal of Cosine



$\blacksquare$

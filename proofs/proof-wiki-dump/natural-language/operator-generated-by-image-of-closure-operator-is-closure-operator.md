Theorem
Let $L = \struct {S, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a complete lattice.
Let $c: S \to S$ be a closure operator on $L$.

Then $\map {\operatorname {operator} } {\struct {c \sqbrk S, \precsim} } = c$
where

$\mathord \precsim = \mathord \preceq \cap \paren {c \sqbrk S \times c \sqbrk S}$
$\map {\operatorname {operator} } {\struct {c \sqbrk S, \precsim} }$ denotes the operator generated by $\struct {c \sqbrk S, \precsim}$


Proof
Let $x \in S$.
By definition of closure operator/inflationary:

$x \preceq \map c x$
By definition of upper closure of element:

$\map c x \in x^\succeq$
By definition of image of mapping:

$\map c x \in c \sqbrk S$
By definition of intersection:

$\map c x \in x^\succeq \cap c \sqbrk S$
By definitions of infimum and lower bound:

$\map {\inf_L} {x^\succeq \cap c \sqbrk S} \preceq \map c x$
We will prove that

$\map c x$ is lower bound for $x^\succeq \cap c \sqbrk S$
Let $y \in x^\succeq \cap c \sqbrk S$
By definition of intersection:

$y \in x^\succeq$ and $y \in c \sqbrk S$
By definition of image of mapping:

$\exists z \in S: y = \map c z$
By definition of closure operator/idempotent:

$y = \map c y$
By definition of upper closure of element:

$x \preceq y$
Thus by definition of closure operator/increasing:

$\map c x \preceq y$
$\Box$

By definition of infimum:

$\map c x \preceq \map {\inf_L} {x^\succeq \cap c \sqbrk S}$
By definition of antisymmetry:

$\map c x = \map {\inf_L} {x^\succeq \cap c \sqbrk S}$
Thus by definition of operator generated by $\struct {c \sqbrk S, \precsim}$:

$\map {\map {\operatorname {operator} } {\struct {c \sqbrk S, \precsim} } } x = \map c x$
Hence by Equality of Mappings:

$\map {\operatorname {operator} } {\struct {c \sqbrk S, \precsim} } = c$
$\blacksquare$

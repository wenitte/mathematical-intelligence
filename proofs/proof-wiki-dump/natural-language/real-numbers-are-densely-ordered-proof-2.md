Corollary to Between two Real Numbers exists Rational Number
$\forall a, b \in \R: a < b \implies \paren {\exists c \in \R: a < c < b}$


Proof
From Between two Real Numbers exists Rational Number:

$\exists r \in \Q: a < r < b$
Since a rational number is also a real number, the result follows by definition.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $B$ be a body undergoing a force $\mathbf F$.
Let $B$ be travelling at a velocity $\mathbf v$ at time $t$.
Let mass travelling at a velocity $\mathbf v + \mathbf w$ be added to $B$ at a rate of $\dfrac {\d m} {\d t}$.
Let $m$ be the mass of $B$ at time $t$.

Then the equation of motion of $B$ is given by:

$\mathbf w \dfrac {\d m} {\d t} + \mathbf F = m \dfrac {\d \mathbf v} {\d t}$


Proof
From Newton's Second Law of Motion:

$\mathbf F = \map {\dfrac \d {\d t} } {m \mathbf v}$
Then the added momentum being added to $B$ by the mass being added to it is given by:

$\paren {\mathbf v + \mathbf w} \dfrac {\d m} {\d t}$
Hence:














\(\ds \paren {\mathbf v + \mathbf w} \dfrac {\d m} {\d t} + \mathbf F\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\dfrac \d {\d t} } {m \mathbf v}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds m \dfrac {\d \mathbf v} {\d t} + \mathbf v \dfrac {\d m} {\d t}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \mathbf w \dfrac {\d m} {\d t} + \mathbf F\)

\(=\)







\(\ds m \dfrac {\d \mathbf v} {\d t}\)

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $100$
Digital Squares
Find a number which, together with its square, shall contain all the $9$ digits once, and once only, the $0$ disallowed.
Thus, if the square of $378$ happened to be $152 \, 694$, it would be a perfect solution.
But unfortunately the actual square is $142 \, 884$, which gives us repeated $4$s and $8$s, and omits the $6$, $5$, and $9$.


Solution
The following solutions are the only ones:














\(\ds 567^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 321 \, 489\)




















\(\ds 854^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 729 \, 316\)











Proof
See Penholodigital Square Equation for a full analysis.


This theorem requires a proof.In particular: Revisit that page so as to ensure that Dudeney's own analysis is implemented: We need only examine cases where the digits in the root number sum to $9$, $18$, or $27$; or $8$, $17$, or $26$, and it can never be a lower sum than $317$ to form the necessary six figures.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by crafting such a proof.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{ProofWanted}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

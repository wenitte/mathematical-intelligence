Theorem
Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $\ideal 1$ be its unit ideal.

Then its radical equals $\ideal 1$:

$\map \Rad {\ideal 1} = \ideal 1$.


Proof
By definition of ideal:

$\map \Rad {\ideal 1} \subseteq A$
By Ideal of Ring is Contained in Radical:

$\ideal 1 = A \subseteq \Rad {\ideal 1}$.
By definition of set equality:

$\map \Rad {\ideal 1} = \ideal 1$
$\blacksquare$

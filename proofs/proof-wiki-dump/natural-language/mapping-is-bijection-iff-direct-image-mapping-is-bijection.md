Theorem
Let $f: S \to T$ be a mapping.
Let $f^\to: \powerset S \to \powerset T$ be the direct image mapping of $f$.

Then:

$f^\to$ is a bijection
if and only if

$f: S \to T$ is also a bijection.


Proof
Follows immediately from:

Mapping is Injection iff Direct Image Mapping is Injection
Mapping is Surjection iff Direct Image Mapping is Surjection
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Pell's equation:

$x^2 - 8 y^2 = 1$
has the positive integral solutions:














\(\ds \tuple {x, y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {3, 1}\)




















\(\ds \tuple {x, y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {17, 6}\)




















\(\ds \tuple {x, y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {99, 35}\)




















\(\ds \tuple {x, y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {577, 204}\)




















\(\ds \tuple {x, y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tuple {3363, 1189}\)









and so on.


Proof
From Continued Fraction Expansion of $\sqrt 8$:

$\sqrt 8 = \sqbrk {2, \sequence {1, 4} }$
The cycle is of length $2$.
By Solution of Pell's Equation, the only solutions of $x^2 - 8 y^2 = 1$ are:

${p_{2 r} }^2 - 8 {q_{2 r} }^2 = \paren {-1}^{2 r}$
for $r = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$
When $r = 1$ this gives:

${p_2}^2 - 8 {q_2}^2 = 1$
which is the solution required.
From Convergents of Continued Fraction Expansion of $\sqrt 8$:

$p_2 = 3$
$q_2 = 1$
although on that page the numbering goes from $p_0$ to $p_9$, and $q_0$ to $q_9$.

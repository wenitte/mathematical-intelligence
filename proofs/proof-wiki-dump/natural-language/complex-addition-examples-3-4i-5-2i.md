Example of Complex Addition
$\paren {3 + 4 i} + \paren {5 + 2 i} = 8 + 6 i$


Proof 1













\(\ds \paren {3 + 4 i} + \paren {5 + 2 i}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {3 + 5} + \paren {4 + 2} i\)





Definition of Complex Addition














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 8 + 6 i\)









$\blacksquare$


Proof 2

Let the complex numbers $3 + 4 i$ and $5 + 2 i$ be represented by the points $P_1$ and $P_2$ respectively in the complex plane.
Complete the parallelogram with $OP_1$ and $OP_2$ as the adjacent sides.
By the Geometrical Interpretation of Complex Addition, the point $P$ represents the complex number $8 + 6 i$, which is the sum of $3 + 4 i$ and $5 + 2 i$.
$\blacksquare$

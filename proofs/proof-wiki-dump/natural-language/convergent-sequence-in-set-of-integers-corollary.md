Theorem
Let $\sequence {x_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ be a sequence of distinct terms in the set $\Z$.
Then $\sequence {x_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ is not convergent.


Proof
By Convergent Sequence in Set of Integers, $\sequence {x_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ is convergent if and only if:

$\exists k \in \N: \forall m \in \N: m > k: x_m = x_k$
But since $\sequence {x_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ is a sequence of distinct terms, for all $k \ne m$, one has $x_m \ne x_k$.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

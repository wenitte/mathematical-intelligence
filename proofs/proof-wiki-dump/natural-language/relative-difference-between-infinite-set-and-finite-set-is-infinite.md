Theorem
Let $S$ be an infinite set.
Let $T$ be a finite set.

Then $S \setminus T$ is an infinite set.


Proof
Aiming forÂ a contradiction, suppose $S \setminus T$ is a finite set.
Then:














\(\ds S\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds S \cup T\)





Set is Subset of Union














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {S \setminus T} \cup T\)





Set Difference Union Second Set is Union



By Union of Finite Sets is Finite, $S \cup T$ is a finite set.
By Subset of Finite Set is Finite, $S$ must also be a finite set.
But $S$ is an infinite set.
This is a contradiction.

Therefore $S \setminus T$ is an infinite set.
$\blacksquare$

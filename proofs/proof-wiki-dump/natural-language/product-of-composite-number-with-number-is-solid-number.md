Theorem
Let $a, b \in \Z$ be positive integers.
Let $a$ be a composite number.
Then $a b$ is a solid number.

In the words of Euclid:

If a composite number by multiplying any number make some number, the product will be solid.
(The Elements: Book $\text{IX}$: Proposition $7$)


Proof
By definition of composite number:

$\exists p, q \in \Z_{>1}: a = p q$
Then:

$a b = p q b$
Hence the result by definition of solid number.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $7$ of Book $\text{IX}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

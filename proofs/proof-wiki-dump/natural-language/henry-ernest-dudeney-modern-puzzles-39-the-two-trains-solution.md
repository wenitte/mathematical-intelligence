Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $39$
The Two Trains
Two railway trains, one $400$ feet long and the other $200$ feet long, ran on parallel rails.
It was found that when they went in opposite directions they passed each other in $5$ seconds,
but when they ran in the same direction the faster train would pass the other in $15$ seconds.
Now, a curious passenger worked out from these facts the rate per hour at which each train ran.
Can the reader discover the correct answer?


Solution
The faster train went at $54 \tfrac 6 {11}$ miles per hour.
The slower train went at $27 \tfrac 3 {11}$ miles per hour.


Proof
Let $v_1$ feet per second denote the speed of the faster train.
Let $v_2$ feet per second denote the speed of the slower train.

We have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 5 \paren {v_1 + v_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 600\)





when they went in opposite directions they passed each other in $5$ seconds




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 15 \paren {v_1 - v_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 600\)





but when they ran in the same direction the faster train would pass the other in $15$ seconds




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 15 \paren {v_1 + v_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1800\)





$3 \times (1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 30 v_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2400\)





$(3) + (2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds v_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 80\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds v_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40\)









The result follows on converting $80$ feet per second and $40$ feet per second into miles per hour.

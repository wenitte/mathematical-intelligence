The list on here previously is now largely out of date.  Use the list on the book page for Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory.
I have now finished all the proofs in $\S 1 - \S 9$.  Basis Representation Theorem for Ordinals is just proven.  $\S 9$ is done!  Skipped Well-Founded Recursion, though.  May come back to it later.
Judging by the length of the proof, I expect Sierpinski's proof that $\operatorname{GCH} \implies \operatorname{AC}$ to break the record for page length on this site.
Template for me...

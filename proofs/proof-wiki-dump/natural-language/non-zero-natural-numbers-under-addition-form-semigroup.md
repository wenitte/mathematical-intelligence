Theorem
Let $\N_{>0}$ be the set of natural numbers without zero, that is:

$\N_{>0} = \N \setminus \set 0$
Let $+$ denote natural number addition.
The structure $\struct {\N_{>0}, +}$ forms a semigroup.


Proof
This is a specific instance of Natural Numbers Bounded Below under Addition form Commutative Semigroup.
$\blacksquare$

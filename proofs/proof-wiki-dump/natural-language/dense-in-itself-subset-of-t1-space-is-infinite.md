Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau_p}$ be a topological space which is $T_1$ (Fréchet).
Let $H \subseteq T$ be dense-in-itself.

Then $H$ is infinite.


Proof
Proof by Contradiction:
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $H$ is finite.
From Finite $T_1$ Space is Discrete, $H$ has the discrete topology.
From Discrete Space is not Dense-In-Itself it then follows that $H$ can not be dense-in-itself.
So for $H$ to be dense-in-itself, it must be infinite.
$\blacksquare$

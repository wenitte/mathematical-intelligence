Problem
To divide a given number into two having a given difference.


Proof
Let $N$ be the given number.
Let $d$ be the given difference.

Let $x$ be the smaller of the two numbers into which $N$ is to be divided.
Thus the greater of the two numbers is $x + d$.

We also have that the greater of the two numbers is $N - x$.
Hence the smaller of the two numbers is found by:














\(\ds N\)

\(=\)







\(\ds x + \paren {x + d}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 x + d\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {N - d} 2\)





rearranging



$\blacksquare$


Example: $N = 100$, $d = 40$
Given number $100$, given difference $40$.

Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, +, \times, \le}$ be the field of real numbers.
Let $\N$ be the natural numbers in $\R$.

Suppose that $A \subseteq \N$ is an inductive set.

Then $A = \N$.


Proof
By definition of the natural numbers in $\R$:

$\N = \ds \bigcap \II$
where $\II$ is the set of inductive sets in $\R$.

Since $A$ was supposed to be inductive, it follows that:

$\N \subseteq A$
from Intersection is Subset: General Result.

Hence by definition of set equality:

$A = \N$
$\blacksquare$

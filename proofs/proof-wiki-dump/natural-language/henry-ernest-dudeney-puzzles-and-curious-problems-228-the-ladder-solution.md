Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $228$
The Ladder
A ladder was fastened on end against a high wall of a building.
It was unfastened and pulled out $4$ yards at the bottom.
It was then found that the ladder had descended just one-fifth of the length of the ladder.
What was the length of the ladder?


Solution
$6 \tfrac 2 3$ yards.


Proof
Let the length of the ladder be $L$ yards.
The ladder, the wall and the ground form a right triangle.
Hence by Pythagoras's Theorem:














\(\ds 4^2 + \paren {L - \dfrac L 5}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds L^2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4^2 + \dfrac {16 L^2} {25}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds L^2\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 400\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 9 L^2\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 20\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 L\)





taking square root of both sides








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds L\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \tfrac 2 3\)









$\blacksquare$

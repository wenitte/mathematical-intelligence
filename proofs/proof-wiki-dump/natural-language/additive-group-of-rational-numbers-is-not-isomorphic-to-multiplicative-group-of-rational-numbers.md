Theorem
Let $\struct {\Q, +}$ be the additive group of rational numbers.
Let $\struct {\Q_{\ne 0}, \times}$ be the multiplicative group of rational numbers.

Then $\struct {\Q_{\ne 0}, \times}$ is not isomorphic to $\struct {\Q, +}$.


Proof
A direct application of Additive Group and Multiplicative Group of Field are not Isomorphic.
$\blacksquare$

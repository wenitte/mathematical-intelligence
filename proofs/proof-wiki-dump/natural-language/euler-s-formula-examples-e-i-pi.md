Example of Use of Euler's Formula
$e^{i \pi} = -1$


Proof













\(\ds e^{i \pi}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cos \pi + i \sin \pi\)





Euler's Formula














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -1 + i \times 0\)





Cosine of $\pi$, Sine of $\pi$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -1\)









$\blacksquare$

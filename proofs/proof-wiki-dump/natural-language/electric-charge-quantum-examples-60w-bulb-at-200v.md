Example of Quanta of Electric Charge
Consider a $60 \ \mathrm W$ light bulb running at $200 \ \mathrm V$.
Approximately $2 \times 10^{18}$ units of elementary charge flow along the filament of the light bulb every second.


Proof
Let $n$ denote the number of units of elementary charge flow along the filament of the light bulb every second
The power $P$ dissipated in an electrical conductor is equal to the current $I$ flowing through it multiplied by the electric potential difference $V$ applied across it.
By definition, current $I$ equals the rate of flow of electric charge.

We have that a $60$ watt bulb with $200$ volts across it.

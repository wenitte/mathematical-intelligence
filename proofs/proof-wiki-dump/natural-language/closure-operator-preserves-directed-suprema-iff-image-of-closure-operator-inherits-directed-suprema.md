Theorem
Let $L = \struct {S, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a complete lattice.
Let $h: S \to S$ be a closure operator on $L$.

Then $h$ preserves directed suprema
if and only if $\struct {h \sqbrk S, \precsim}$ inherits directed suprema.
where

$h \sqbrk S$ denotes the image of $h$,
$\mathord\precsim = \mathord\preceq \cap \paren {h \sqbrk S \times h \sqbrk S}$


Proof
By Operator Generated by Image of Closure Operator is Closure Operator:

$\map {\operatorname{operator} } {\struct {h \sqbrk S, \precsim} } = h$
where $\map {\operatorname{operator} } {\struct {h \sqbrk S, \precsim} }$ denotes the operator generated by $\struct {h \sqbrk S, \precsim}$
Hence the result holds by Operator Generated by Closure System Preserves Directed Suprema iff Closure System Inherits Directed Suprema.
$\blacksquare$

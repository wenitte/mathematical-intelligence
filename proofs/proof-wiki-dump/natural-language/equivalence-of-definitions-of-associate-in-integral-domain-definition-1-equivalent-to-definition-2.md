Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Associate in the context of Integral Domain are equivalent:
Let $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ be an integral domain.
Let $x, y \in D$.

Definition 1
$x$ is an associate of $y$ (in $D$) if and only if they are both divisors of each other.

That is, $x$ and $y$ are associates (in $D$) if and only if $x \divides y$ and $y \divides x$.

Definition 2
$x$ and $y$ are associates (in $D$) if and only if:

$\ideal x = \ideal y$
where $\ideal x$ and $\ideal y$ denote the ideals generated by $x$ and $y$ respectively.


Proof
We are to show that:

$x \divides y \text{ and } y \divides x \iff \ideal x = \ideal y$

Thus:

\(\ds x \divides y \text{ and } y \divides x\)

\(\ds \ideal y \subseteq \ideal x \text{ and } \ideal x \subseteq \ideal y\)





Element in Integral Domain is Divisor iff Principal Ideal is Superset

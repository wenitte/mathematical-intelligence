Theorem
Let $\EE$ be an experiment with a probability space $\struct {\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr}$.

The event space $\Sigma$ of $\EE$ has the property that:

$A, B \in \Sigma \implies A \setminus B \in \Sigma$
That is, the difference of two events is also an event in the event space.


Proof













\(\ds A, B\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \Sigma\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds A, \Omega \setminus B\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \Sigma\)





Definition of Event Space: Axiom $(\text {ES} 2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds A \cap \paren {\Omega \setminus B}\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \Sigma\)





Intersection of Events is Event








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds A \setminus B\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \Sigma\)





Set Difference as Intersection with Relative Complement



$\blacksquare$

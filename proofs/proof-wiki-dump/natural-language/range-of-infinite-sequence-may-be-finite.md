Theorem
Let $\sequence {x_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ be an infinite sequence.
Then it is possible for the range of $\sequence {x_n}$ to be finite.


Proof
Consider the infinite sequence $\sequence {x_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ defined as:

$\forall n \in \N: x_n = \dfrac {1 + \paren {-1}^n} 2$
Thus:

$\sequence {x_n}_{n \mathop \in \N} = 1, 0, 1, 0, \dotsc$
Hence the range of $\sequence {x_n}$ is $\set {0, 1}$, which is finite.
$\blacksquare$

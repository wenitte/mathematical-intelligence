Theorem
Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths of a right-angled triangle, where $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.
Then the side length $l$ of the inscribed square that has a side lying on the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle is given by:

$l = \dfrac {a b c} {a b + c^2}$


Proof

In the figure above, let $BC = a$ and $AC = b$.
$CD$ is drawn such that $AB \perp CD$.
Since $CD$ is the height of $\triangle ABC$:

$CD = \dfrac {a b} c$

Note that $FH \parallel AB$.
Therefore $\triangle CFH \sim \triangle CAB$ by Equiangular Triangles are Similar.
Thus:














\(\ds \frac {CG} {CD}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {FH} {AB}\)





Definition of Similar Triangles














\(\ds \frac {\frac {a b} c - l} {\frac {a b} c}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac l c\)




















\(\ds \frac {a b - c l} {a b}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac l c\)




















\(\ds a b c - c^2 l\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a b l\)




















\(\ds a b c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a b l + c^2 l\)




















\(\ds l\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {a b c} {a b + c^2}\)









$\blacksquare$

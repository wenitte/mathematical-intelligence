Classic Problem
A given number $n$ of trees are to be planted in an orchard so as to make the number of rows of $3$ trees the largest number possible.
That is:
$n$ points are to be configured in the plane so that the number of straight lines that can be drawn through exactly $3$ of these points is maximised.


Solution
Let the maximum number of rows of $3$ for a given number of trees $n$ be denoted $t_3 \left({n}\right)$.
Then we have:














\(\ds t_3 \left({3}\right)\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)




















\(\ds t_3 \left({4}\right)\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)




















\(\ds t_3 \left({5}\right)\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2\)




















\(\ds t_3 \left({6}\right)\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4\)




















\(\ds t_3 \left({7}\right)\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6\)




















\(\ds t_3 \left({8}\right)\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7\)




















\(\ds t_3 \left({9}\right)\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)




















\(\ds t_3 \left({10}\right)\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)




















\(\ds t_3 \left({11}\right)\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 16\)




















\(\ds t_3 \left({12}\right)\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 19\)

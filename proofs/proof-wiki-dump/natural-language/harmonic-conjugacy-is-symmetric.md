Theorem
Let $AB$ and $PQ$ be line segments on a straight line.
Let $P$ and $Q$ be harmonic conjugates with respect to $A$ and $B$.

Then $A$ and $B$ are harmonic conjugates with respect to $P$ and $Q$ .


Proof
By definition of harmonic conjugates, $\tuple {AB, PQ}$ is a harmonic range.




We have:














\(\ds \dfrac {AP} {PB}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac {AQ} {QB}\)





Definition of Harmonic Range








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds -\dfrac {PA} {PB}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\paren {-\dfrac {AQ} {BQ} }\)





reversing the direction of $AP$ and $QB$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {AQ} {BQ}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds -PA\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {AQ \times PB} {BQ}\)





multiplying by $PB$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds -\dfrac {PA} {AQ}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {PB} {BQ}\)





dividing by $BQ$




Hence, by definition, $\tuple {PQ, AB}$ is a harmonic range.
Hence the result, by definition of harmonic conjugates.

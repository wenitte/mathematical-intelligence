Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
After staining the holy chaplet of fair-eyed Justice that I might see thee, all-subduing gold, grow so much, I have nothing;
for I gave forty talents under evil auspices to my friends in vain,
while, O ye varied mischances of men, I see my enemy in possession of the half, the third, and the eighth of my fortune.


Solution
Let $n$ be the value in talents of the narrator's fortune.
We have:














\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40 + \dfrac n 2 + \dfrac n 3 + \dfrac n 8\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 24 n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12 n + 8 n + 3 n + 24 \times 40\)





multiplying through by $24 = \lcm \set {2, 3, 8}$ and simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {24 - 12 - 8 - 3} n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 24 \times 40\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 24 \times 40\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 960\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 40 + 480 + 320 + 120\)










So the narrator started with $960$ talents.
$\blacksquare$

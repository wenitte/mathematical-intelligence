Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space.
Let $\R$ denote the real numbers.
Let $f: M \to \R$ and $g: M \to \R$ be real-valued functions from $M$ to $\R$ which are continuous on $M$.
Let $\lambda, \mu \in \R$ be arbitrary real numbers.

Then:

$\lambda f + \mu g$ is 窶残ontinuous on $M$.


Proof
From the Multiple Rule for Continuous Mappings on Metric Space, we have that:

$\lambda \map f x$ and $\mu \map g x$ are 窶残ontinuous.
From the Sum Rule for Continuous Mappings on Metric Space, we have that:

$\lambda \map f x + \mu \map g x$ is 窶残ontinuous.

So, by definition of 窶残ontinuous again, we have that $\lambda f + \mu g$ is continuous on $M$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers.
Let $a \in \Q_p$.
Let $\epsilon \in \R_{>0}$ be a strictly positive real number.
Let $B \subseteq \Q_p$.

Then: 

$B$ is a closed ball in $p$-adic numbers with radius $\epsilon$ and centre $a$
if and only if:

$B$ is a closed ball of the normed division ring $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ with radius $\epsilon$ and centre $a$

That is, the definition of a closed ball in $p$-adic numbers is a specific instance of the general definition of a closed ball in a normed division ring.


Proof
From P-adic Numbers form Non-Archimedean Valued Field:

the $p$-adic numbers $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ form a non-Archimedean valued field.
The definition of a closed ball in $p$-adic numbers is identical to the definition of a closed ball of a normed division ring with respect to the norm $\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$.

Theorem
Let $A \subseteq \R$ be the set of all points on $\R$ defined as:

$A := \set 0 \cup \set {\dfrac 1 n : n \in \Z_{>0} }$
Let $\struct {A, \tau_d}$ be the integer reciprocal space with zero under the usual (Euclidean) topology.

Then the components of $A$ are singletons.


Proof
From Integer Reciprocal Space with Zero is Totally Separated, $A$ is totally separated.
From Totally Separated Space is Totally Disconnected, $A$ is totally disconnected. 
The result follows by definition of totally disconnected.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $a$ and $b$ be consecutive integers.
Then $b^3 - a^3$ is odd.


Proof 1
Let $a, b \in \Z$ such that $b = a + 1$.
Then:














\(\ds b^3 - a^3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a + 1}^3 - a^3\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a^3 + 3 a^2 + 3 a + 1 - a^3\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 a \paren {a + 1} + 1\)









From Product of Consecutive Integers is Even, $a \paren {a + 1}$ is even.
Hence $3 a \paren {a + 1} + 1$ is odd.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Let $a, b \in \Z$ such that $b = a + 1$.
Either:

$a$ is even and $b$ is odd
or:

$b$ is even and $a$ is odd.
Hence from Parity of Integer equals Parity of Positive Power either:

$a^3$ is even and $b^3$ is odd
or:

$b^3$ is even and $a^3$ is odd.
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

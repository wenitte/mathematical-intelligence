Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Euler-Gompertz Constant are equivalent:

Integral Form
The Euler-Gompertz constant is the real number $G$ defined as:

$G = \ds \int_0^\infty \dfrac {e^{-u} } {1 + u} \rd u$
As a Continued Fraction
The Euler-Gompertz constant is the real number $G$ defined as:

$G = \cfrac 1 {2 - \cfrac {1^2} {4 - \cfrac {2^2} {6 - \cfrac {3^2} {8 - \cfrac {4^2} {10 - \dotsb} } } } }$


Proof
Integral Form implies Continued Fraction Form
Let $G$ be the integral form of the Euler-Gompertz constant.
Then by definition:

$G = \ds \int_0^\infty \dfrac {e^{-u} } {1 + u} \rd u$

Theorem
Let $r \in \Q$ be a rational number.
Then $r$ is an algebraic number of degree $1$.


Proof
Let $r$ be expressed in the form:

$r = \dfrac p q$
By Rational Number is Algebraic, $r$ can be expressed as the root of the linear function:

$q x - p = 0$
A polynomial of degree zero is a constant polynomial, and has no roots.
Hence the result by definition of degree of algebraic number.

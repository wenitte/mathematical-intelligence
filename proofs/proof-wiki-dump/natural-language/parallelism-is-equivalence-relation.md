Theorem
Let $S$ be the set of straight lines in the plane.
For $l_1, l_2 \in S$, let $l_1 \parallel l_2$ denote that $l_1$ is parallel to $l_2$.

Then $\parallel$ is an equivalence relation on $S$.


Proof
Checking in turn each of the criteria for equivalence:


Reflexivity
By definition of parallel lines, the contemporary definition is for a straight line to be declared parallel to itself.
Hence for a straight line $l$:

$l \parallel l$
Thus $\parallel$ is seen to be reflexive.
$\Box$


Symmetry
Let $l_1 \parallel l_2$.
By definition of parallel lines, $l_1$ does not meet $l_2$ when produced indefinitely.
Hence $l_2$ similarly does not meet $l_1$ when produced indefinitely.
That is:

$l_2 \parallel l_1$
Thus $\parallel$ is seen to be symmetric.
$\Box$


Transitivity
From Parallelism is Transitive Relation:

$l_1 \parallel l_2$ and $l_2 \parallel l_3$ implies $l_1 \parallel l_3$.
Thus $\parallel$ is seen to be transitive.
$\Box$

$\parallel$ has been shown to be reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
Hence by definition it is an equivalence relation.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $G$ be a group.
Let $H$ be a central subgroup of $G$.

Then $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.


Proof
Let $H$ be a central subgroup of $G$.
By definition of central subgroup:

$H \subseteq \map Z G$
where $\map Z G$ is the center of $G$.

Thus we have that $H$ is a group which is a subset of $\map Z G$.
Therefore by definition $H$ is a subgroup of $\map Z G$.
We also have from Center of Group is Abelian Subgroup that $\map Z G$ is an abelian group.


The validity of the material on this page is questionable.In particular: Being a normal subgroup of a subgroup does not mean being a normal subgroup of the whole groupYou can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by resolving the issues.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Questionable}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.
It follows from Subgroup of Abelian Group is Normal that $Z$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

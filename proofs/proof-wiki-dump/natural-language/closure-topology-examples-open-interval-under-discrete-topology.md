Example of Closure in the context of Topology
Let $\T = \struct {\R, \tau_d}$ denote the topological space formed from the set of real numbers $\R$ together with the discrete topology $\tau_d$.
Let $H$ be the open real interval:

$H = \openint a b$
Then the closure of $H$ in $T$ is:

$H^- = \openint a b$


Proof
From Set in Discrete Topology is Clopen, $H = \openint a b$ is both open and closed.
From Set is Closed iff Equals Topological Closure it follows that $H^- = H = \openint a b$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $A$ and $B$ be classes.
Then the Cartesian product $A \times B$ is a small class if and only if $B \times A$ is small.


Proof













\(\ds A \times B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \set {\tuple {x, y} : x \in A \land y \in B}\)





Definition of Cartesian Product














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \set {\tuple {y, x} : x \in A \land y \in B}^{-1}\)





Definition of Inverse Relation














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {B \times A}^{-1}\)





Definition of Cartesian Product




Let $B \times A$ be a small class.
Then, by Inverse of Small Relation is Small, $A \times B$ is also small.
Similarly, let $A \times B$ be small.
Then, by Inverse of Small Relation is Small, $B \times A$ is also small.
$\blacksquare$

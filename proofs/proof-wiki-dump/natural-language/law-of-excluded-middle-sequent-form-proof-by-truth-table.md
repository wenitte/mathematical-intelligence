Theorem
The Law of Excluded Middle can be symbolised by the sequent:

$\vdash p \lor \neg p$


Proof
We apply the Method of Truth Tables to the proposition $\vdash p \lor \neg p$.
As can be seen by inspection, the truth value of the main connective, that is $\lor$, is $\T$ for each boolean interpretation for $p$.

$\begin{array}{|c|c|cc|} \hline
p & \lor & \neg & p \\
\hline
\F & \T & \T & \F \\
\T & \T & \F & \T \\
\hline
\end{array}$
$\blacksquare$

Modern Puzzles by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $55$
The Repeated Quartette
If we multiply $64253$ by $365$ we get the product $23452345$, where the first $4$ figures are repeated.
What is the largest number that we can multiply by $365$ in order to produce a similar product of $8$ figures repeated in the same order?
There is no objection to a repetition of figures -- that is, the $4$ that are repeated need not be all different, as in the case shown.


Solution
$273863$


Proof
The key point is that a number of the form $\sqbrk {abcdabcd}_{10}$ is equal to $10001 \times \sqbrk {abcd}_{10}$.
We also have that:

$10001 = 73 \times 137$
and:

$365 = 5 \times 73$
So the $8$ digit number we end up with is a multiple of $5 \times 73 \times 137 = 50005$.
All we need to understand is that it has $2$ repeated sets of $4$ digits and ends in $5$.
The largest one of those is:

$99959995 = 273863 \times 365$
and the job is done.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The closed-form expression for the $n$th octagonal number is:

$O_n = n \paren {3 n - 2}$


Proof
Octagonal numbers are $k$-gonal numbers where $k = 8$.
From Closed Form for Polygonal Numbers we have that:

$\map P {k, n} = \dfrac n 2 \paren {\paren {k - 2} n - k + 4}$

Hence:














\(\ds O_n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac n 2 \paren {\paren {8 - 2} n - 8 + 4}\)





Closed Form for Polygonal Numbers














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds n \paren {3 n - 2}\)









Hence the result.

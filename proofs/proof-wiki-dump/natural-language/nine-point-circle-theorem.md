Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
These $9$ points:

the feet of the altitudes of $\triangle ABC$
the midpoints of the sides of $\triangle ABC$
the midpoints of the lines from the vertices of $\triangle ABC$ to the orthocenter $H$ of $\triangle ABC$
all lie on the circumference of a circle.

The center $M$ lies on the Euler line of $\triangle ABC$, at the midpoint between the orthocenter $H$ and the circumcenter $O$.




This circle is known as the Feuerbach circle, or the nine point circle.


Proof
Let the altitudes of $\triangle ABC$ be $AD$, $BE$ and $CF$.
Let $H$ be the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$.
Let $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ bisect $AH$, $BH$ and $CH$, respectively.
Let $A_m$, $B_m$, and $C_m$ bisect $BC$, $AC$, and $AB$, respectively.

Draw the circle with $B_mY$ as diameter.
By Thales' Theorem/Converse:

$Z$ and $C_m$ are also on the circle.
Since $ZC_m = Y B_m$:

$ZC_m$ is a diameter of the circle.
mutatis mutandis:

$XA_m$ is a diameter of the circle.

Using diameter $B_mY$, by Thales' Theorem/Converse:

$E$ is on the circle.
Using diameter $C_mZ$, by Thales' Theorem/Converse:

$F$ is on the circle.
Using diameter $A_mX$, by Thales' Theorem/Converse:

$D$ is on the circle.

The result follows.

Also known as
The nine point circle theorem is also known as:

the ninepoint circle theorem
the nine-point circle theorem.
There is little consistency in the literature.

Feuerbach's Theorem


Historical Note
The Nine Point Circle Theorem was proved in $1820$ by Jean-Victor Poncelet and Charles Julien Brianchon.
In $1822$, Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach proved that the nine point circle was tangent to the incircle and all $3$ excircles.
Hence this circle is often referred to as the Feuerbach circle.

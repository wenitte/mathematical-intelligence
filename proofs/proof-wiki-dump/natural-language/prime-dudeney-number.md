Theorem
The only prime Dudeney number is $17$:


Proof
We have that:














\(\ds 17^3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4913\)




















\(\ds 17\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 + 9 + 1 + 3\)










From Sequence of Dudeney Numbers, the complete set of positive integers with this property are:

$0, 1, 8, 17, 18, 26, 27$
Of these, only $17$ is prime.
$\blacksquare$

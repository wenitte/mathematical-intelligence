Corollary to Isometry between Metric Spaces is Continuous
Let $M_1 = \struct {A_1, d_1}$ and $M_2 = \struct {A_2, d_2}$ be metric spaces.
Let $\phi: M_1 \to M_2$ be an isometry.

Then its inverse $\phi^{-1}: M_2 \to M_1$ is a continuous mapping.


Proof
From Inverse of Isometry of Metric Spaces is Isometry, $\phi^{-1}$ is an isometry.
The result follows from Isometry between Metric Spaces is Continuous.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $M$ be a class which is minimally inductive under a progressing mapping $g$.
Let $x$ be a fixed point of $g$.

Then $M$ is well-ordered under the subset relation.


Proof
A minimally inductive class under $g$ is the same thing as a minimally closed class under $g$ with respect to $\O$.
The result then follows by a direct application of Minimally Closed Class under Progressing Mapping is Well-Ordered.
$\blacksquare$

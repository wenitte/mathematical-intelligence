Theorem
Let $L = \struct{A, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a lattice.

Let $\operatorname{id}_A$ denote the identity mapping on $A$.

Then:

$\operatorname{id}_A$ is a lattice homomorphism of $L$ to $L$


Proof
Follows from Identity Mapping is Automorphism applied to $\struct{A, \vee}$ and $\struct{A, \wedge}$.
$\blacksquare$

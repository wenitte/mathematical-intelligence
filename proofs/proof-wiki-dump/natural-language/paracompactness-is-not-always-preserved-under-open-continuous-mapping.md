Theorem
Let $T_A = \struct {X_A, \tau_A}$ be a topological space which is paracompact.
Let $T_B = \struct {X_B, \tau_B}$ be another topological space.

Let $\phi: T_A \to T_B$ be a mapping which is both continuous and open.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $T_B$ is also paracompact.


Proof
We have Open Continuous Image of Paracompact Space is not always Countably Metacompact.
We also have:

Paracompact Space is Metacompact
Metacompact Space is Countably Metacompact
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

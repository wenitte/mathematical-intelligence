Porism to Construction of Regular Dodecahedron within Given Sphere
In the words of Euclid:

From this it is manifest that, when the side of the cube is cut in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment is the side of the dodecahedron.
(The Elements: Book $\text{XIII}$: Proposition $17$ : Porism)


Proof
Apparent from the construction.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{XIII}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Theorem
Let $S$ and $T$ be finite sets with the same cardinality:

$\size S = \size T = n$

Then there are $n!$ bijections from $S$ to $T$.


Proof
Follows directly from Cardinality of Set of Injections and Equivalence of Mappings between Finite Sets of Same Cardinality.
$\blacksquare$


Examples
Set of Cardinality $4$
Let $S$ be a set whose cardinality is $4$:

$\card S = 4$
Then there are $24$ bijections from $S$ to itself.

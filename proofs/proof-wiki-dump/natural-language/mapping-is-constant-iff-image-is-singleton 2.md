Theorem
A mapping is a constant mapping if and only if its image is a singleton.


Proof
Necessary Condition
Let $f_c: S \to T$ be a constant mapping. Then from the definition of the image of a element:

$\forall x \in S: \map {f_c} x = c \implies \Img S = \set c$
Thus the image of $f_c: S \to T$ is a singleton.


Sufficient Condition
Let $f: S \to T$ such that its image is a singleton $\set c \subseteq T$.










\(\ds \forall x \in S: \, \)



\(\ds \map f x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \Img f\)





Definition of Image of Mapping








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)

\(\ds \forall x \in S: \, \)



\(\ds \map f x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \set c\)





by hypothesis








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)

\(\ds \forall x \in S: \, \)



\(\ds \map f x\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c\)





Definition of Singleton




Thus $f: S \to T$ is a constant mapping (and we can write it $f_c: S \to T$).

Theorem
Let $a, b, c, d$ be quantities.
Let $a : b = c : d$ where $a : b$ denotes the ratio between $a$ and $b$.

Then for any numbers $m$ and $n$:

$m a : n b = m c : n d$

In the words of Euclid:

If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth, any equimultiples whatever of the first and third will also have the same ratio to any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth respectively, taken in corresponding order.
(The Elements: Book $\text{V}$: Proposition $4$)


Euclid's Proof
Let a first magnitude $A$ have to a second magnitude $B$ the same ratio as a third $C$ to a fourth $D$.
Let equimultiples $E, F$ be taken of $A, C$, and let different equimultiples $G, H$ be taken of $B, D$.
We need to show that $E : G = F : H$.


Let equimultiples $K, L$ be taken of $E, F$ and other arbitrary equimultiples $M, N$ be taken of $G, H$.
We have that $E$ is the same multiple of $A$ that $L$ is of $C$.
So from Proposition $3$: Associative Law of Multiplication, $K$ is the same multiple of $A$ that $L$ is of $C$.
For the same reason, $M$ is the same multiple of $B$ that $N$ is of $D$.
We have that:

$A$ is to $B$ as $C$ is to $D$
of $A, C$ equimultiples $K, L$ have been taken
of $B, D$ other equimultiples $M, N$ have been taken.
So from the definition of equality of ratios:

if $K$ is in excess of $M$, $L$ is also in excess of $N$
if $K$ is equal to $M$, $L$ is equal to $N$
if $K$ is less than $M$, $L$ is less than $N$
But $K, L$ are equimultiples of $E, F$.
Therefore as $E$ is to $G$, so is $F$ to $H$.

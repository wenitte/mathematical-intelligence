Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $\struct {\Q_p, \norm {\,\cdot\,}_p}$ be the $p$-adic numbers.
Let $\tau_p$ be the topology induced by the non-Archimedean norm $\norm {\,\cdot\,}_p$.

Then the topological space $\struct {\Q_p, \tau_p}$ is second-countable.


Proof
From Countable Basis for P-adic Numbers, the topological space $\struct {\Q_p, \tau_p}$ has a countable basis.
By definition, $\struct {\Q_p, \tau_p}$ is second-countable.
$\blacksquare$

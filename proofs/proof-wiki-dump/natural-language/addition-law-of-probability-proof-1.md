Theorem
$\map \Pr {A \cup B} = \map \Pr A + \map \Pr B - \map \Pr {A \cap B}$


Proof
By definition, a probability measure is a measure.
Hence, again by definition, it is a countably additive function.
By Measure is Finitely Additive Function, we have that $\Pr$ is an additive function.
So Additive Function is Strongly Additive can be applied directly.
$\blacksquare$

Puzzle
There came $3$ dutchmen of my acquaintance to see me, being lately married;
they brought their wives with them.
The men's names were Hendrick, Claas, and Cornelius;
the women's Geertrick, Catriin, and Anna;
but I forget the name of each man's wife.
They told me that they had been at market, to buy hogs;
each person bought as many hogs as they gave shillings for each hog;
Hendrick bought $23$ hogs more than Catriin,
and Claas bought $11$ more than Geertrick;
likewise, each man laid out $3$ guineas more than his wife.
I desire to know the name of each man's wife.


Solution
Note that a guinea is $21$ shillings.

Hendrick bought $32$ hogs and his wife Anna bought $31$
Claas bought $12$ hogs and his wife Catriin bought $9$
Cornelius bought $8$ hogs and his wife Geertrick bought $1$.


Proof
It is immediate from the last condition that each man paid $63$ shillings more than his wife.
It is also immediate from the first condition that the amount paid for the hogs by each person is a square number.
So we are looking for pairs of square numbers which differ by $63$.
This leads us to the pairs:

$\tuple {1^2, 8^2}$, that is $\tuple {1, 64}$
$\tuple {9^2, 12^2}$, that is $\tuple {81, 144}$
$\tuple {31^2, 32^2}$, that is $\tuple {961, 1024}$
The relations between Hendrick and Catriin, and Claas and Geertrick, provide us with the information we need to match husband and wife for all three.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof of the problem of the Dutchmen and their $3$ wives is reported as being the work of Mr N. Farrer, whose identity is not known.

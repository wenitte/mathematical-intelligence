Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $X$ be an $F_\sigma$ set of $T$.

Then it is not necessarily the case that $X$ is a closed set of $T$.


Proof
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a finite complement topology on an uncountable set $S$.
Let $X \subseteq S$ be an $F_\sigma$ set of $T$.
From $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ Subsets of Uncountable Finite Complement Space:

$X$ is neither open nor closed in $T$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

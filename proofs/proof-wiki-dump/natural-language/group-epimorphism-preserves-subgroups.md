Theorem
Let $\struct {G_1, \circ}$ and $\struct {G_2, *}$ be groups.
Let $\phi: \struct {G_1, \circ} \to \struct {G_2, *}$ be a group epimorphism.

Then:

$H \le G_1 \implies \phi \sqbrk H \le G_2$
where:

$\phi \sqbrk H$ denotes the image of $H$ under $\phi$
$\le$ denotes subgroup.

That is, group epimorphism preserves subgroups.


Proof
By definition, $\phi$ is a fortiori a group homomorphism.
The result then follows from Group Homomorphism Preserves Subgroups.

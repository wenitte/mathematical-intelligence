Theorem
In the words of Euclid:

Magnitudes commensurable with the same magnitude are commensurable with one another also.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $12$)


Proof
Let $A$ and $B$ be magnitudes which are both commensurable with another magnitude $C$.
As $A$ is commensurable with $C$, from Ratio of Commensurable Magnitudes:

$A$ has to $C$ the ratio which a number has to a number.
Let it have the ratio which $D$ has to $E$, where $D$ and $E$ are numbers.

As $C$ is commensurable with $B$, from Ratio of Commensurable Magnitudes:

$C$ has to $B$ the ratio which a number has to a number.
Let it have the ratio which $F$ has to $G$, where $F$ and $G$ are numbers.

From Construction of Sequence of Numbers with Given Ratios, let the numbers $H$, $K$, $L$ be assigned the ratios:

$D : E = H : K$
$F : G = K : L$
So:














\(\ds A : C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds D : E\)




















\(\ds D : E\)

\(=\)







\(\ds H : K\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds A : C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds H : K\)





Equality of Ratios is Transitive



and:














\(\ds C : B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds F : G\)




















\(\ds F : G\)

\(=\)







\(\ds K : L\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds C : B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds K : L\)





Equality of Ratios is Transitive



Then:














\(\ds C : B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds K : L\)




















\(\ds A : C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds H : K\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds A : B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds H : L\)





Equality of Ratios Ex Aequali



That is, $A$ has to $B$ the ratio which a number has to a number.
From Magnitudes with Rational Ratio are Commensurable:

$A$ and $B$ are commensurable with each other.

This proof is Proposition $12$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

Pickleminster to Quickville
Two trains, $A$ and $B$, leave Pickleminster for Quickville at the same time as two trains, $C$ and $D$, leave Quickville for Pickleminster.
$A$ passes $C$ $120$ miles from Pickleminster and $D$ $140$ miles from Pickleminster.
$B$ passes $C$ $126$ miles from Quickville and $D$ half-way between Pickleminster and Quickville.
Now, what is the distance from Pickleminster to Quickville?


Solution
$210$ miles.


Proof
Let $V_A$, $V_B$, $V_C$ and $V_D$ miles per hour be the speeds of $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ respectively.
Let $d$ be the distance between Pickleminster and Quickville.

From the given conditions:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \dfrac {120} {V_A}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {d - 120} {V_C}\)





$A$ passes $C$ $120$ miles from Pickleminster




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \dfrac {140} {V_A}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {d - 140} {V_D}\)





$A$ passes $D$ $140$ miles from Pickleminster




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \dfrac {d - 126} {V_B}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {126} {V_C}\)





$B$ passes $C$ $126$ miles from Quickville




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \dfrac d {2 V_B}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac d {2 V_D}\)





$B$ passes $D$ half-way between Pickleminster and Quickville








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds V_B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds V_D\)





simplifying $(4)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 140 V_B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {d - 140} V_A\)





substituting into $(2)$ and simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 126 V_B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {d - 126} V_C\)





simplifying $(3)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 120 V_C\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {d - 120} V_A\)





simplifying $(1)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 126 V_B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\paren {d - 126} \paren {d - 120} V_A} {120}\)





eliminating $V_C$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 126 \dfrac {\paren {d - 140} V_A} {140}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {\paren {d - 126} \paren {d - 120} V_A} {120}\)





eliminating $V_B$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 120 \times 126 \paren {d - 140}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 140 \paren {d - 126} \paren {d - 120}\)





eliminating $V_A$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 108 \paren {d - 140}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {d - 126} \paren {d - 120}\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds d^2 - 354 d + 30240\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





gathering everything together








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {d - 210} \paren {d - 144}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





factorising



This leads to the $2$ solutions:

$d = 144$
$d = 210$
The first of these suggests that $A$ travels $140$ miles while $D$ travels $4$ miles, which would mean $A$ goes $35$ times as fast as $D$.
The second answer is more sensible: it has $A$ going twice as fast as $B$ and $D$, and $C$ going at a speed between these.
$\blacksquare$

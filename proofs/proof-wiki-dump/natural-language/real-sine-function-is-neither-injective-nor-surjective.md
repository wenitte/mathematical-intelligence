Theorem
The real sine function is neither an injection nor a surjection.


Proof
This is immediately apparent from the graph of the sine function:



For example:

$\map \sin 0 = \map \sin \pi = 0$
and so the real sine function is not an injection.
Then, for example:

$\nexists x \in \R: \map \sin x = 2$
and so the real sine function is not a surjection.
$\blacksquare$

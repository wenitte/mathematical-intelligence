Example of Bijection
Let $f: \Z \to \Z$ be the mapping defined on the set of integers as:

$\forall n \in \Z: \map f n = n + 1$
Then $f$ is a bijection.


Proof
Let $n_1$ and $n_2$ be integers.
Then:














\(\ds \map f {n_1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f {n_2}\)





by supposition








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n_1 + 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n_2 + 1\)





Definition of $f$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds n_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds n_2\)









Hence by definition $f$ is an injection.
$\Box$

Let $m \in \Z$.
Let $n = m - 1$.
We have that:

$n \in \Z$
and:

$\map f n = m$
Hence by definition $f$ is a surjection.
$\Box$

Thus $f$ is both an injection and a surjection, and so a bijection
$\blacksquare$

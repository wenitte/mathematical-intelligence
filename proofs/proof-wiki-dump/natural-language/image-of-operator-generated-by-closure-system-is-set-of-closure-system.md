Theorem
Let $L = \struct {X, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$ be a complete lattice.
Let $S = \struct {T, \precsim}$ be a closure system of $L$.

Then $\map {\operatorname {operator} } S \sqbrk X = T$
where $\map {\operatorname {operator} } S$ denotes the operator generated by $S$.


Proof
Define $f = \map {\operatorname {operator} } S$.


$\subseteq$
Let $x \in f \sqbrk X$.
By definition of image of mapping:

$\exists y \in X: x = \map f y$
Define $Y = y^\succeq \cap T$
By definition of complete lattice:

$Y$ admits an infimum in $L$.
By Intersection is Subset:

$Y \subseteq T$
By definition of closure system:

$S$ inherits infima.
By definition of infima inheriting:

$Y$ admits an infimum in $S$ and $\inf_S Y = \inf_L Y$
Thus by definition of operator generated by $S$:

$x \in T$
$\Box$


$\supseteq$
Let $x \in T$.
By definition of ordered subset:

$T \subseteq X$
By definition of subset:

$x \in X$
Define $Y = x^{\succeq_L} \cap T$
By definitions of upper closure of element and reflexivity:

$x \in x^{\succeq_L}$
By definition of intersection:

$x \in Y$
By definitions of infimum and lower bound:

$\inf_L Y \preceq x$
By Intersection is Subset:

$Y \subseteq x^{\succeq_L}$
By Infimum of Subset:

$\inf_L x^{\succeq_L} \preceq \inf_L Y$
By Infimum of Upper Closure of Element:

$x \preceq \inf_L Y$
By definition of antisymmetry:

$x = \inf_L Y$
By definition of operator generated by $S$:

$x = \map f x$
Thus by definition of image of mapping:

$x \in f \sqbrk X$
$\Box$

Hence by definition of set equality:

$f \sqbrk X = T$
$\blacksquare$

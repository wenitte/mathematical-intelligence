Theorem
There exists at least one example of a metacompact topological space which is not also a paracompact space.


Proof
Let $T$ be the Dieudonné plank.

From Dieudonné Plank is Metacompact, $T$ is a metacompact space.
From Dieudonné Plank is not Paracompact, $T$ is not a paracompact space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

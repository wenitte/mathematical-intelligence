Theorem
Let $\struct {\R, +}$ be the additive group of real numbers.
Let $\struct {\C, +}$ be the additive group of complex numbers.

Then $\struct {\R, +}$ is a subgroup of $\struct {\C, +}$.


Proof
Let $x, y \in \C$ such that $x = x_1 + 0 i, y = y_1 + 0 i$.
As $x$ and $y$ are wholly real, we have that $x, y \in \R$.
Then $x + y = \paren {x_1 + y_1} + \paren {0 + 0} i$ which is also wholly real.
Also, the inverse of $x$ is $-x = -x_1 + 0 i$ which is also wholly real.
Thus by the Two-Step Subgroup Test, $\struct {\R, +}$ is a subgroup of $\struct {\C, +}$.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let a triangle be copied either by rotation or reflection.
Then if you mung them together by corresponding sides what you get is either a parallelogram or a kite.

Let $\triangle ABC$ be any triangle.  We can form a congruent triangle by reflection or translation.


Case $1$: Reflection
Reflect $\triangle ABC$ across one of its sides.
Without loss of generality draw the two triangles with the longest side shared.  
The resulting $\Box ABCD$ has two pairs of equal sides adjacent (it forms a kite).

It happens that if you have an obtuse triangle and you join it by one of its 2 shorter sides you get a dart.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by resolving the issues.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Questionable}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

Translate a second congruent copy of $\triangle ABC$, rotate it.
Without loss of generality draw the two triangles together with the longest side shared.
The resulting $\Box ABCD$ has two pairs of opposite sides equal.

By Quadrilateral is Parallelogram iff Both Pairs of Opposite Sides are Equal or Parallel:

$\Box ABCD$ is a parallelogram
By definition of parallelogram:

Both pairs of opposite angles in $\Box ABCD$ are equal

Consider the special case where $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle with $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ABD$ both right angles.
Then $\Box ABCD$ has opposite sides parallel and both pairs of opposite angles equal.

Since one pair of angles is a pair of right angles:

the other pair consists of two right angles
Therefore by the definition of rectangle:

$\Box ABCD$ is a rectangle.
$\blacksquare$

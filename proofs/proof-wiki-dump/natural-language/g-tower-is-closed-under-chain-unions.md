Theorem
Let $M$ be a class.
Let $g: M \to M$ be a progressing mapping on $M$.
Let $M$ be a $g$-tower.

Then $M$ is closed under chain unions.


Proof
By definition:

a $g$-tower is a class which is minimally superinductive under $g$
a class which is minimally superinductive under $g$ is superinductive under $g$
a superinductive class is closed under chain unions.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

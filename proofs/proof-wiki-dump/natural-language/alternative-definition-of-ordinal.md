Theorem
A set $S$ is an ordinal if and only if $S$ is transitive and is strictly well-ordered by the $\in$-relation.


Proof
Necessary Condition
Suppose that $S$ is an ordinal.
Then $S$ is transitive.

By definition, the strict well-ordering on $S$ is given by the $\in$-relation.
Hence, the necessary condition is satisfied.
$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Suppose that $S$ is a transitive set that is strictly well-ordered by the $\in$-relation.
Let $a \in S$.
Then:














\(\ds a\)

\(=\)







\(\ds S \cap a\)





$S$ is transitive, $a \subseteq S$; then apply Intersection with Subset is Subset














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \set {x \in S: x \in a}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds S_a\)





Definition of Initial Segment



That is, $S$ is an ordinal.

Theorem
Let $\map M {x, y}$ and $\map N {x, y}$ be homogeneous functions of the same degree.

Then:

$\dfrac {\map M {x, y} } {\map N {x, y} }$
is homogeneous of zero degree.


Proof
Let:

$\map Q {x, y} = \dfrac {\map M {x, y} } {\map N {x, y} }$
where $M$ and $N$ are homogeneous functions of degree $n$.

Let $t \in \R$.
Then:














\(\ds \map Q {t x, t y}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\map M {t x, t y} } {\map N {t x, t y} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {t^n \map M {x, y} } {t^n \map N {x, y} }\)





as $M$ and $N$ are homogeneous of degree $n$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds t^0 \frac {\map M {x, y} } {\map N {x, y} }\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds t^0 \map Q {x, y}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map Q {x, y}\)









The result follows from the definition.

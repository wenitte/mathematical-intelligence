Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $\R$ denote the real number line.
Let $f, g :S \to \R$ be bounded continuous real-valued functions.
Let $\size f : S \to \R$ denote  the absolute value of $f$, that is, $\size f$ denotes the mapping defined by:

$\forall s \in S : \map {\size f} s = \size{\map f s}$
 
Then:

$\size f$ is a bounded continuous real-valued function


Proof
Follows from:

Absolute Value Rule for Bounded Real-Valued Function
Absolute Value Rule for Continuous Real-Valued Function

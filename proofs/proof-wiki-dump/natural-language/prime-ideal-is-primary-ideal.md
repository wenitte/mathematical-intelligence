Theorem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $\mathfrak p$ be a prime ideal of $R$.

Then $\mathfrak p$ is a primary ideal of $R$.


Proof
Let $xy \in \mathfrak p$.
Let $x \not \in \mathfrak p$
By definition of prime ideal:

$y^1 = y \in \mathfrak p$
Thus, by definition, $\mathfrak p$ is a primary ideal.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $P$ be a regular polygon.
Then $P$ is a cyclic polygon.


Proof
Let $P$ be a regular polygon.
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $P$ is not cyclic.
Let $AB$, $BC$ and $CD$ be sides of $P$ such that $A$, $B$ and $C$ are on the circumference of a circle $K$ such that $D$ is not on that circumference.
This has to be possible, or all vertices of $P$ would lie on $K$.
That would make $P$ cyclic which contradicts our supposition about $P$.

Let the center of $K$ be $O$.
As $D$ is not on the circumference of that circle, then $OC \ne OD$.
Hence $\angle ABC \ne \angle BCD$ and so $P$ is not equiangular.
Hence a fortiori $P$ is not a regular polygon.
This contradicts our assertion about $P$.
Hence by Proof by Contradiction it follows that $P$ is cyclic.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a discrete topological space.

Then $T$ is first-countable.


Proof
From Point in Discrete Space is Neighborhood, every point $x \in S$ is contained in an open set $\set x$.
From the definition of local basis, it is clear that $\set {\set x}$ is (trivially) a local basis at $x$.
That is, that every open set of $S$ containing $x$ also contains at least one of the sets of $\set {\set x}$.
Equally trivially, we have that $\set {\set x}$ is countable.
Hence the result by definition of first-countable.
$\blacksquare$

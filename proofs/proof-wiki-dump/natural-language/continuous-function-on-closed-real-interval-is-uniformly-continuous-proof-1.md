Theorem
Let $\closedint a b$ be a closed real interval.
Let $f: \closedint a b \to \R$ be a continuous function.

Then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $\closedint a b$.


Proof
We have that $\R$ is a metric space under the usual (Euclidean) metric.
We also have from the Heine-Borel Theorem that $\closedint a b$ is compact.
So the result Heine-Cantor Theorem applies.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $a, b, c, d$ be numbers.
Then:

$\paren {a^2 + b^2} \paren {c^2 + d^2} = \paren {a c + b d}^2 + \paren {a d - b c}^2$


Proof
Let $z_1 = a - b i, z_2 = c + d i$ be complex numbers.
Let $\cmod z$ denote the complex modulus of a given complex number $z \in \C$.

By definition of complex multiplication:

$(1): \quad z_1 z_2 = \paren {a c + b d} + \paren {a d - b c} i$

Then:














\(\ds \cmod {z_1 z_2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cmod {z_1} \cmod{z_2}\)





Complex Modulus of Product of Complex Numbers








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \cmod {\paren {a - b i} \paren {c + d i} }^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cmod {a - b i}^2 \cmod {c + d i}^2\)





$z_1 = a - b i, z_2 = c + d i$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {a c + b d}^2 + \paren {a d - b c}^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {a^2 + b^2} \paren {c^2 + d^2}\)

Source of Name
This entry was named for Brahmagupta‎ and Leonardo Fibonacci‎.


Historical Note
Both Brahmagupta‎ and Leonardo Fibonacci‎ described what is now known as the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci Identity in their writings:

628: Brahmagupta: Brahmasphutasiddhanta (The Opening of the Universe)
1225: Fibonacci: Liber quadratorum (The Book of Squares)

However, it appeared earlier than either of those in Diophantus of Alexandria's Arithmetica of the third century C.E.

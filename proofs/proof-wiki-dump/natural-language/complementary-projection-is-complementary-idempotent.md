Theorem
Let $\HH$ be a Hilbert space.
Let $A$ be a projection.
Let $B$ be the complementary projection of A.

Then $B$ is the complementary idempotent of $A$.


Proof
By the definition of projection, $A$ is an idempotent operator.
The result follows immediately from the definitions of:

complementary projection
complementary idempotent
where the constructions of the complementary projection and the complementary idempotent from $A$ are identical.

Corollary to Closure of Subset in Subspace
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $H$ be a subset of $S$.
Let $T_H = \struct {H, \tau_H}$ be the topological subspace on $H$.

Let $K \subseteq S$.
Let $\map {\cl_T} K$ denote the closure of $K$ in $T$.
Let $\map {\cl_H} {K \cap H}$ denote the closure of $K \cap H$ in $T_H$.

Then:

$\map {\cl_H} {K \cap H} \subseteq \map {\cl_T} K \cap H$


Proof













\(\ds \map {\cl_H} {K \cap H}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\cl_T} {K \cap H} \cap H\)





Closure of Subset in Subspace














\(\ds \)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds \map {\cl_T} K \cap H\)





Topological Closure of Subset is Subset of Topological Closure

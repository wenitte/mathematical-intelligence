Theorem
Let $T = \struct {\R, \tau}$ be the compact complement topology on $\R$.

Then $\tau$ is coarser than the usual (Euclidean) topology in $\R$.


Proof
Let $U \in \tau$.
Then $V = \R \setminus U$ is compact.
So by definition $V$ is closed in the Euclidean topology.
That is, $U = \R \setminus V$ is open in the Euclidean topology.
That is, every open set in the compact complement topology is also open in the Euclidean topology.
Hence the result, by definition of coarser topology.

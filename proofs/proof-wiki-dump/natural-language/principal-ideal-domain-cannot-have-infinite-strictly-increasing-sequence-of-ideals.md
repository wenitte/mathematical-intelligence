Theorem
Let $\struct {D, +, \circ}$ be a principal ideal domain.

Then $D$ cannot have an infinite sequence of ideals $\sequence {j_n}_{n \mathop \in \N}$ such that:

$\forall n \in \N: J_n \subsetneq j_{n + 1}$


Proof
Let $K = \ds \bigcup_{n \mathop \in \N} J_n$.
Then from Increasing Union of Sequence of Ideals is Ideal, $K$ is an ideal of $D$.
We have that $D$ is a principal ideal domain.
Hence there exists $a \in D$ such that:

$K = \ideal a$
where $\ideal a$ is the principal ideal of $D$ generated by $a$.
But $a \in J_m$ for some $m \in \N$.
Thus $K \subseteq J_m$
Thus it follows that $J_{m + 1} \subseteq J_m$ which contradicts our initial assertion that:

$\forall n \in \N: J_n \subsetneq j_{n + 1}$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

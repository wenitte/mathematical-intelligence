Theorem
Let $\R$ be the real number line considered as an Euclidean space.
Let $I = \closedint a b$ be a closed real interval.

Then $I$ is compact.


Proof
From Closed Real Interval is Closed Set, $I$ is a closed set of $\R$.
From Real Interval is Bounded in Real Numbers, $I$ is bounded in $\R$.
The result follows by definition of compact.
$\blacksquare$

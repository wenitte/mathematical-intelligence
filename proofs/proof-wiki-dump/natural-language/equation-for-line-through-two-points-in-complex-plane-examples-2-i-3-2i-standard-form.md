Example of Use of Equation for Line through Two Points in Complex Plane
Let $L$ be a straight line through $2 + i$ and $3 - 2 i$ in the complex plane.
Then $L$ can be expressed by the equation:

$3 x + y = 7$


Proof
From Two-Point Form of Equation of Straight Line in Plane, a straight line $L$ passing through $2$ points $z_1 = x_1 + i y_1$ and $z_2 = x_2 + i y_2$ has the equation:

$\dfrac {x - x_1} {x_2 - x_1} = \dfrac {y - y_1} {y_2 - y_1}$

Hence:














\(\ds \dfrac {x - 2} {3 - 2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {y - 1} {-2 - 1}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x - 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {y - 1} {-3}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds -3x + 6\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y - 1\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 3 x + y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7\)

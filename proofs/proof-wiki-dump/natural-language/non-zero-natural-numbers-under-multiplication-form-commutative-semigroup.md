Theorem
Let $\N_{>0}$ be the set of natural numbers without zero, that is, $\N_{>0} = \N \setminus \set 0$.
The structure $\struct {\N_{>0}, \times}$ forms an infinite commutative semigroup.


Proof
Semigroup Axiom $\text S 0$: Closure
From Natural Numbers have No Proper Zero Divisors:

$\forall m, n \in \N: m \times n = 0 \iff m = 0 \lor n = 0$
It follows that:

$\forall m, n \in \N_{>0}: m \times n \ne 0$
and so:

$\forall m, n \in \N_{>0}: m \times n \in \N_{>0}$
That is, $\struct {\N_{>0}, \times}$ is closed.
$\Box$


Semigroup Axiom $\text S 1$: Associativity
Natural Number Multiplication is Associative.
$\Box$


Commutativity
Natural Number Multiplication is Commutative.
$\Box$


Infinite
We have that the Natural Numbers are Infinite.
Then we have that Infinite if Injection from Natural Numbers.
The mapping $s: \N \to \N_{>0}: \map s n = n + 1$ is such an injection.
Hence $\N_{>0}$ is infinite.

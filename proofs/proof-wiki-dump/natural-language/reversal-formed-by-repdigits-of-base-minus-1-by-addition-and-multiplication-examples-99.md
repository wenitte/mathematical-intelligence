Example of Reversal formed by Repdigits of Base minus 1 by Addition and Multiplication













\(\ds 99 + 99\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 198\)




















\(\ds 9 \times 99\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 891\)











Proof
A direct application of Reversal formed by Repdigits of Base minus 1 by Addition and Multiplication:
$\blacksquare$

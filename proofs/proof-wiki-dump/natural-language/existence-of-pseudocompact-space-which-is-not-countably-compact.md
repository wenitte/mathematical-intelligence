Theorem
There exists at least one example of a pseudocompact topological space which is not also a countably compact space.


Proof
Let $T$ be an infinite particular point space.

From Particular Point Space is Pseudocompact, $T$ is a pseudocompact space.
From Infinite Particular Point Space is not Weakly Countably Compact, $T$ is not a weakly countably compact space.
From Countably Compact Space is Weakly Countably Compact, $T$ is not a countably compact space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

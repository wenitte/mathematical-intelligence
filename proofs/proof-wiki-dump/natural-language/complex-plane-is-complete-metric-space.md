Theorem
The complex plane, along with the metric induced by the norm given by the complex modulus, forms a complete metric space.


Proof
Let $z = x + iy$ be a complex number, where $x, y \in \R$.
Now, we can identify the complex number $z$ with the ordered pair $\left( x, y \right) \in \R^2$.
The norm on $\C$ given by the complex modulus is then identical to the Euclidean norm on $\R^2$.
Therefore, metric on $\C$ induced by the norm given by the complex modulus is identical to the Euclidean metric on $\R^2$ induced by the Euclidean norm.
By Euclidean Space is Complete Metric Space, $\C$ is a complete metric space.

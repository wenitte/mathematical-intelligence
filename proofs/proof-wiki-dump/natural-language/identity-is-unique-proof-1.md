Theorem
Let $\struct {S, \circ}$ be an algebraic structure that has an identity element $e \in S$.

Then $e$ is unique.


Proof
Suppose $e_1$ and $e_2$ are both identity elements of $\struct {S, \circ}$.
Then by the definition of identity element:

$\forall s \in S: s \circ e_1 = s = e_2 \circ s$
Then:

$e_1 = e_2 \circ e_1 = e_2$
So:

$e_1 = e_2$
and there is only one identity element after all.

Examples of Use of Group Direct Product of Cyclic Groups
Let $C_2$ denote the cyclic group of order $2$.
The group direct product $C_2 \times C_2$ is not a cyclic group.


Proof
For the group direct product of the cyclic groups $C_m$ and $C_n$ to be cyclic, it is necessary and sufficient for $m$ and $n$ to be coprime.
That is not the case here.
It is seen from Group Direct Product of $C_2 \times C_2$ that this is an instance of the Klein $4$-group.
This is not a cyclic group.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $M = \struct {A, d}$ be a metric space.
Then $M$ is a completely normal space.


Proof
By definition, a topological space is completely normal space if and only if it is:

a $T_5$ space
a $T_1$ (Fréchet) space.
We have that:

a Metric Space is $T_5$
a Metric Space is $T_2$ (Hausdorff)
a $T_2$ (Hausdorff) Space is a $T_1$ (Fréchet) Space.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

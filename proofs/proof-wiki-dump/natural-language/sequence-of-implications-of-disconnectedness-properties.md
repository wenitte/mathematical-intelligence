Theorem
Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be disconnectedness properties and let:

$P_1 \implies P_2$
mean:

If a topological space $T$ satsifies property $P_1$, then $T$ also satisfies property $P_2$.

Then the following sequence of implications holds:





Regular


$\impliedby$


Zero Dimensional and $T_0$


$\impliedby$


Discrete Space


$\implies$


$\implies$


$\implies$


Scattered and $T_1$









$\Big\Downarrow$





$\Big\Downarrow$











$\Big\Downarrow$









$\Big\Downarrow$





Extremally Disconnected











$\Big\Downarrow$

$\implies$


$\implies$


Totally Separated

$T_1$


$\impliedby$


Totally Disconnected

$\Big\Downarrow$















Totally Pathwise Disconnected




Proof
The relevant justifications are listed as follows:

Discrete Space is $T_0$ and Discrete Space is Zero Dimensional.
Discrete Space is $T_1$ and Discrete Space is Scattered.
Zero Dimensional Space is T3, and by definition of a regular space as being both $T_3$ and $T_0$.
Zero Dimensional $T_0$ Space is Totally Separated.
Discrete Space is Extremally Disconnected.
Extremally Disconnected Space is Totally Separated.
Totally Separated Space is Completely Hausdorff and Urysohn.
Totally Separated Space is Totally Disconnected.
Scattered $T_1$ Space is Totally Disconnected.
Totally Disconnected Space is Totally Pathwise Disconnected.
Totally Disconnected Space is $T_1$.

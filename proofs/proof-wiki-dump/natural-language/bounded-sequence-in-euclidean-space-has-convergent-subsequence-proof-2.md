Theorem
Let $\sequence {x_i}_{i \mathop \in \N}$ be a bounded sequence in the Euclidean space $\R^n$.
Then some subsequence of $\sequence {x_i}_{i \mathop \in \N}$ converges to a limit.


Proof
Let the range of $\sequence {x_i}$ be $S$.
By Closure of Bounded Subset of Metric Space is Bounded $\map \cl S$ is bounded in $\R^n$.
By Topological Closure is Closed, $\map \cl S$ is closed in $\R^n$.
By the Heine-Borel Theorem, $S$ is compact.
The result follows from Compact Subspace of Metric Space is Sequentially Compact in Itself.

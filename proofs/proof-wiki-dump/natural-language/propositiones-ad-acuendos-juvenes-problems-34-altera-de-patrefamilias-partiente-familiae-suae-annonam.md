Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes by Alcuin of York: Problem $34$
Altera de Patrefamilias Partiente Familiae Suae Annonam
Another Landowner Dividing Grain among his Household
A gentleman has a household of $200$ persons and orders that they be given $100$ measures of grain.
He directs that:
each man should receive $3$ measures,
each woman $2$ measures,
and each child $\frac 1 2$ a measure.
How many men, women and children must there be?


Solution
There are $6$ solutions:

$17$ men, $5$ women and $78$ children
$14$ men, $10$ women and $76$ children
$11$ men, $15$ women and $74$ children
$8$ men, $20$ women and $72$ children
$5$ men, $25$ women and $70$ children
$2$ men, $30$ women and $68$ children.

The solution given by Alcuin is:

$11$ men, $15$ women and $74$ children.


Proof
Let $m$, $w$ and $c$ denote the number of men, women and children respectively.
We have:














\(\ds 3 m + 2 w + \dfrac c 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





apportioning the measures of grain




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 m + 4 w + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 200\)










\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds m + w + c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





the total number of people




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 m + 3 w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 100\)





$(1) - (2)$



We note that $5 m$ is a multiple of $5$.
Hence $3 w$ also has to be a multiple of $5$.
Thus $w$ has to be a multiple of $5$.

Hence the following possible solutions for $m$ and $w$:














\(\ds w = 0\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 20\)




















\(\ds w = 5\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 17\)




















\(\ds w = 10\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 14\)




















\(\ds w = 15\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 11\)




















\(\ds w = 20\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 8\)




















\(\ds w = 25\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 5\)




















\(\ds w = 30\)

\(,\)







\(\ds m = 2\)










It is implicit that there are at least some women in the household, so the solution:

$m = 20, w = 0, c = 80$
is usually ruled out.

Hence we have the following solutions:

$m = 17, w = 5, c = 78$
$m = 14, w = 10, c = 76$
$m = 11, w = 15, c = 74$
$m = 8, w = 20, c = 72$
$m = 5, w = 25, c = 70$
$m = 2, w = 30, c = 68$

This can be expressed as:














\(\ds m\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 20 - 3 n\)




















\(\ds w\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5 n\)




















\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 80 - 2 n\)









where $n = 1, 2, \ldots, 6$.

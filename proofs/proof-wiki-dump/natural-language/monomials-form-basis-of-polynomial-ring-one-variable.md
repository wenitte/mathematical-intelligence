Theorem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity.
Let $R \sqbrk X$ be a polynomial ring over $R$ in the variable $X$.

Then the monomials of $R \sqbrk X$ are a basis of $R \sqbrk X$ as a module over $R$.


Proof
Follows from:

Polynomial is Linear Combination of Monomials
Monomials of Polynomial Ring are Linearly Independent
$\blacksquare$

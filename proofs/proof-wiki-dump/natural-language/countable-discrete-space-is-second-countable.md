Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a countable discrete topological space.
Then $T$ is second-countable.


Proof
From Basis for Discrete Topology, the set:

$\BB := \set {\set x: x \in S}$
is a basis for $T$.
There is a trivial one-to-one correspondence $\phi: S \leftrightarrow \BB$ between $S$ and $\BB$:

$\forall x \in S: \map \phi x = \set x$

Let $S$ be countable.
Then $\BB$ is also countable by definition of countability.
So we have that $T$ has a countable basis, and so is second-countable by definition.
$\blacksquare$

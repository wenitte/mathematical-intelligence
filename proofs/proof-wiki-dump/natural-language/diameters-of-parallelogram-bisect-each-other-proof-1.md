Theorem
Let $\Box ABCD$ be a parallelogram with diameters $AC$ and $BD$.
Let $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$.

Then $E$ is the midpoint of both $AC$ and $BD$.


Proof


By definition of parallelogram:
By Opposite Sides and Angles of Parallelogram are Equal:

$AB = CD$
$AD = BC$
$\angle ABC = \angle ADC$
$\angle BAD = \angle BCD$
Therefore by Triangle Side-Angle-Side Congruence:

$\triangle ABC = \triangle ADC$
$\triangle BAD = \triangle BCD$
Thus:

$\angle ADE = \angle CBE$
$\angle DAE = \angle BCE$
We have $AD = BC$.
So from Triangle Angle-Side-Angle Congruence:

$\triangle ADE = \triangle CBE$
and so:

$DE = BE$
$AE = CE$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

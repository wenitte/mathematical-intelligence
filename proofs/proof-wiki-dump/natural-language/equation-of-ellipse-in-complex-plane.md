Theorem
Let $\C$ be the complex plane.
Let $E$ be an ellipse in $\C$ whose major axis is $d \in \R_{>0}$ and whose foci are at $\alpha, \beta \in \C$.

Then $C$ may be written as:

$\cmod {z - \alpha} + \cmod {z - \beta} = d$
where $\cmod {\, \cdot \,}$ denotes complex modulus.

Exterior

Proof
By definition of complex modulus:

$\cmod {z - \alpha}$ is the distance from $z$ to $\alpha$
$\cmod {z - \beta}$ is the distance from $z$ to $\beta$.
Thus $\cmod {z - \alpha} + \cmod {z - \beta}$ is the sum of the distance from $z$ to $\alpha$ and from $z$ to $\beta$.
This is precisely the equidistance property of the ellipse.
From Equidistance of Ellipse equals Major Axis, the constant distance $d$ is equal to the major axis of $E$.

Examples
Example: Foci at $1$ and $i$, Major Axis $4$
The ellipse in the complex plane whose major axis is of length $4$ and whose foci are at the points corresponding to $1$ and $i$ is given by the equation:

$\cmod {z - 1} + \cmod {z - i} = 4$


Example: Foci at $-3$ and $3$, Major Axis $10$
The ellipse in the complex plane whose major axis is of length $10$ and whose foci are at the points corresponding to $-3$ and $3$ is given by the equation:

$\cmod {z + 3} + \cmod {z - 3} = 10$
and also as:

$\dfrac {x^2} {25} + \dfrac {y^2} {16} = 1$


Example: Foci at $-2 i$ and $2 i$, Major Axis $6$
The ellipse in the complex plane whose major axis is of length $6$ and whose foci are at the points corresponding to $-2 i$ and $2 i$ is given by the equation:

$\cmod {z + 2 i} + \cmod {z - 2 i} = 6$


Example: Foci at $-2 i$ and $2 i$, Major Axis $6$
The ellipse in the complex plane whose major axis is of length $6$ and whose foci are at the points corresponding to $-2 i$ and $2 i$ is given by the equation:

$\cmod {z + 2 i} + \cmod {z - 2 i} = 6$


Example: Foci at $\tuple {2, -3}$ and $\tuple {-2, 3}$, Major Axis $10$
The inequality:

$\cmod {z + 2 - 3 i} + \cmod {z - 2 + 3 i} < 10$
defines the inside of the ellipse in the complex plane whose major axis is of length $10$ and whose foci are at the points corresponding to $\tuple {2, -3}$ and $\tuple {2, -3}$.

Theorem
Let $A$ be an ordinal.

Then:

$A \in \On \lor A = \On$
where $\On$ denotes the class of all ordinals.


Proof
We have by hypothesis that $A$ is an ordinal
From Class of All Ordinals is Ordinal and Ordinal Membership is Trichotomy:

$A \in \On \lor A = \On \lor \On \in A$
But by the Burali-Forti Paradox $\On$ is a proper class.
Therefore:

$A \in \On \lor A = \On$
$\blacksquare$


This article, or a section of it, needs explaining.In particular: please say or link to why being a proper class means that $\On \notin A$You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by explaining it.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Explain}} from the code.

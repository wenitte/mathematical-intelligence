Theorem
Let $L = \struct {X, \preceq}$ be a complete lattice.
Let $S = \struct {T, \precsim}$ be an infima inheriting ordered subset of $L$.

Then $S$ is a complete lattice.


Proof
Let $A$ be subset of $T$.
By definition of complete lattice:

$A$ admits an infimum in $L$.
Thus by definition of infima inheriting:

$A$ admits an infimum in $S$.
Hence by dual of Lattice is Complete iff it Admits All Suprema:

$S$ is a complete lattice.
$\blacksquare$

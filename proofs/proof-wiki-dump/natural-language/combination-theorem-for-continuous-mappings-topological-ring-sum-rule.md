Theorem
Let $\struct{S, \tau_{_S}}$ be a topological space.
Let $\struct{R, +, *, \tau_{_R}}$ be a topological ring.

Let $f, g: \struct{S, \tau_{_S}} \to \struct{R, \tau_{_R}}$ be continuous mappings.

Let $f + gÂ : S \to R$ be the mapping defined by:

$\forall x \in S: \map {\paren{f + g}} x = \map f x + \map g x$

Then:

$f + g: \struct {S, \tau_{_S} } \to \struct {R, \tau_{_R} }$ is continuous.


Proof
By definition of a topological ring, $\struct {R, +, \tau_{_R} }$ is a topological group.
From Product Rule for Continuous Mappings to Topological Group:

$f + g: \struct {S, \tau_{_S} } \to \struct {R, \tau_{_R} }$ is a continuous mapping.
$\blacksquare$

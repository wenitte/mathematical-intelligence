Example of Factorial
The factorial of $1$ is $1$:

$1! = 1$


Proof
From the definition of factorial:

$n! = \ds \prod_{k \mathop = 1}^n k$
where $\prod$ denotes continued product.
When $n = 1$ we have:














\(\ds 1!\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \prod_{k \mathop = 1}^1 k\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 1\)









$\blacksquare$

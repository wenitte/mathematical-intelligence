Theorem
Let $T = \struct {\CC, \tau_d}$ be the Cantor space.

Then $T$ is not locally connected.


Proof
Let $\BB$ be a basis of $T$.
Let $A \in \BB$.
By definition of $\BB$, $A$ is an open set of $T$.
But the Cantor Space is Totally Separated.
Therefore $A$ is not a connected set.
Hence the result from definition of a locally connected space.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The following definitions of the concept of Second Pentagonal Number are equivalent:

Definition 1
The second pentagonal numbers are the integers obtained by applying the Closed Form for Pentagonal Numbers to negative $n$:

$\map {P'} n = \dfrac {-n \paren {-3 n - 1} } 2$
Definition 2
The second pentagonal numbers are the integers obtained from formula:

$\map {P'} n = \dfrac {n \paren {3 n + 1} } 2$
for $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$


Proof
Let $\map {P'} n$ denote the $n$th second pentagonal number.
We have:














\(\ds \map {P'} n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {-n \paren {-3 n - 1} } 2\)





DefinitionÂ 1 of Second Pentagonal Number














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {n \paren {3 n + 1} } 2\)





simplifying



But:

$\map {P'} n = \dfrac {n \paren {3 n + 1} } 2$
is the definition of a second pentagonal Number by definition 2.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

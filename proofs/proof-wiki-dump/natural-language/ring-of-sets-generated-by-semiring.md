Theorem
Let $\SS$ be a semiring of sets.
Let $\map \RR \SS$ be the minimal ring generated by $\SS$.
Let $\LL$ be the system of sets $A$ with the finite expansions:

$\ds A = \bigcup_{k \mathop = 1}^n A_k$
with respect to the sets $A_k \in \SS$.

Then $\LL = \map \RR \SS$.


Proof
First we need to show that $\LL$ is a ring of sets.
Let $A, B \in \LL$.
Then by definition of $\LL$, they have expansions:














\(\ds A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \bigcup_{i \mathop = 1}^m A_i\)





where $A_i \in \SS$














\(\ds B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \bigcup_{j \mathop = 1}^n B_j\)





where $B_j \in \SS$




Since $\SS$ is a semiring of sets, we have:

$C_{ij} = A_i \cap B_j \in \SS$

By Pairwise Disjoint Subsets in Semiring Part of Partition, there exist finite expansions:














\(\ds A_i\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\bigcup_{j \mathop = 1}^n C_{i j} } \cup \paren {\bigcup_{k \mathop = 1}^{r_i} D_{i k} }\)





where $D_{i k} \in \SS$














\(\ds B_j\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\bigcup_{i \mathop = 1}^m C_{i j} } \cup \paren {\bigcup_{l \mathop = 1}^{s_j} E_{j l} }\)





where $E_{j l} \in \SS$




From these, it follows that $A \cap B$ and $A \ast B$ have the finite expansions:














\(\ds A \cap B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \bigcup_{i, \ j} C_{i j}\)




















\(\ds A \ast B\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\bigcup_{i, \ k} D_{i k} } \cup \paren {\bigcup_{j, \ l} E_{j l} }\)










Hence both $A \cap B \in \LL$ and $A \ast B \in \LL$.
So by definition, $\LL$ is a ring of sets.

From the details of the above construction, the fact that $\LL$ is the minimal ring generated by $\SS$ follows immediately.

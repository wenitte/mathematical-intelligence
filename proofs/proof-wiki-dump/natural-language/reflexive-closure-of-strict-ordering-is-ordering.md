Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\prec$ be a strict ordering on $S$.
Let $\preceq$ be the reflexive closure of $\prec$.

Then $\preceq$ is an ordering.


Proof
Since $\prec$ is a strict ordering, it is by definition transitive and asymmetric.
By Asymmetric Relation is Antisymmetric, $\prec$ is antisymmetric.
Thus by Reflexive Closure of Transitive Antisymmetric Relation is Ordering, $\preceq$ is an ordering.
$\blacksquare$

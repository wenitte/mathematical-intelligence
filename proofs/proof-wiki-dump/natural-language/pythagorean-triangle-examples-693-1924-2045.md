Example of Primitive Pythagorean Triangle
The triangle whose sides are of length $693$, $1924$ and $2045$ is a primitive Pythagorean triangle.





Proof













\(\ds 693^2 + 1924^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 480 \, 249 + 3 \, 701 \, 776\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \, 182 \, 025\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2045^2\)









It follows by Pythagoras's Theorem that $693$, $1924$ and $2045$  form a Pythagorean triple.

Note that $693$ and $1924$ are coprime.
Hence, by definition, $693$, $1924$ and $2045$ form a primitive Pythagorean triple.
The result follows by definition of a primitive Pythagorean triangle.
$\blacksquare$

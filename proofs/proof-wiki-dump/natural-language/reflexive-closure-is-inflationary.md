Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $R$ denote the set of all endorelations on $S$.
Then the reflexive closure operator is an inflationary mapping on $R$.


Proof
Let $\RR \in R$.
The reflexive closure $\RR^=$ of $\RR$ is defined as:

$\RR^=Â := \RR \cup \Delta_S$
From Set is Subset of Union:

$\RR \subseteq \RR^=$
Hence the reflexive closure operator is an inflationary mapping.
$\blacksquare$

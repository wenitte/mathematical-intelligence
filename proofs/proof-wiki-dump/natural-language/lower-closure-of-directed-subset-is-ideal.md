Theorem
Let $\mathscr S = \struct {S, \preceq}$ be an ordered set.
Let $D$ be a directed subset of $S$.

Then

$D^\preceq$ is an ideal in $\mathscr S$
where $D^\preceq$ denotes the lower closure of $D$.


Proof
By Directed iff Lower Closure Directed:

$D^\preceq$ is directed.
By Lower Closure is Lower Section:

$D^\preceq$ is a lower section.
Thus by definition

$D^\preceq$ is an ideal in $\mathscr S$
$\blacksquare$

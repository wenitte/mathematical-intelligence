A Chain Puzzle
A man has $80$ links of old chain in $13$ fragments, as shown in the diagram.

It will cost him $1 \oldpence$ to open a link and $2 \oldpence$ to weld one together again.
What is the lowest price it must cost him to join all the pieces together so as to form an endless chain?
A new chain will cost him $3 \shillings$ (that is, $36 \oldpence$)
What is the cheapest method of procedure?
Remember that the small and large links must run alternately.


Solution
Open all the links of the piece of chain with $4$ links, on the right hand end of the middle row.
Open all the links of the piece of chain with $3$ links, in the middle of the middle row.
Open all the links of one of the remaining pieces of chain with $3$ links, for example from the middle of the bottom row.
We now have $10$ open links: $5$ large and $5$ small.
At the ends of the remaining $10$ pieces, there are $10$ large links and $10$ small links in total.
Each of the large open links can be used to connect $2$ of the small open links.
Similarly, each of the small open links can be used to connect $2$ of the large open links.
This costs $2 \shillings 6 \oldpence$


Proof
To open a link and rejoin it costs $3 \oldpence$
By opening one link at the end of each of the $13$ pieces will cost $39 \oldpence$, that is, $3 \shillings 3 \oldpence$
Using taht strategy it would be cheaper to buy a new chain.
The best that can be done is to open all the links of $3$ pieces containing $10$ links of the appropriate nature so as to use them to join the remaining $10$ pieces at a cost of $30 \oldpence$, that is $2 \shillings 6 \oldpence$
$\blacksquare$

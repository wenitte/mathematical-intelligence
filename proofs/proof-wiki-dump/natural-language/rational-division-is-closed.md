Theorem
The set of rational numbers less zero is closed under division:

$\forall a, b \in \Q_{\ne 0}: a / b \in \Q_{\ne 0}$


Proof
From the definition of division:

$a / b := a \times \paren {b^{-1} }$
where $b^{-1}$ is the inverse for rational multiplication.
From Non-Zero Rational Numbers under Multiplication form Infinite Abelian Group, the algebraic structure $\struct {\Q_{\ne 0}, \times}$ is a group.
From Group Axiom $\text G 3$: Existence of Inverse Element it follows that every $b \in \Q_{\ne 0}$ has an inverse element $b^{-1} \in \Q$ under multiplication.
From Group Axiom $\text G 0$: Closure it follows that $\Q_{\ne 0}$ is closed under multiplication.
Hence the result:

$\forall a, b \in \Q_{\ne 0}: a / b \in \Q_{\ne 0}$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Consider the one-parameter family of curves:

$(1): \quad x^2 + y^2 = c$
Its family of orthogonal trajectories is given by the equation:

$y = c x$





Proof
We use the technique of formation of ordinary differential equation by elimination.
Differentiating $(1)$ with respect to $x$ gives:

$2 x + 2 y \dfrac {\d y} {\d x} = 0$
from which:

$\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} = -\dfrac x y$
Thus from Orthogonal Trajectories of One-Parameter Family of Curves, the family of orthogonal trajectories is given by:

$\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} = \dfrac y x$

By Solution to Separable Differential Equation:

$\ds \int \frac {\d y} y = \int \frac {\d x} x$
which by Primitive of Reciprocal gives:

$\ln y = \ln x + \ln c$
or:

$y = c x$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

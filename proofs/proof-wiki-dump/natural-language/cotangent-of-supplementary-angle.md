Theorem
$\map \cot {\pi - \theta} = -\cot \theta$
where $\cot$ denotes tangent.

That is, the cotangent of an angle is the negative of its supplement.


Proof













\(\ds \map \cot {\pi - \theta}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\map \cos {\pi - \theta} } {\map \sin {\pi - \theta} }\)





Cotangent is Cosine divided by Sine














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {-\cos \theta} {\sin \theta}\)





Cosine of Supplementary Angle and Sine of Supplementary Angle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\cot \theta\)









$\blacksquare$

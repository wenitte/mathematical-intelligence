Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle whose sides are $a$, $b$ and $c$ opposite vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively.

Then the area $\AA$ of $\triangle ABC$ is given by:

$\AA = \dfrac {a b c} {4 R}$
where $R$ is the circumradius of $\triangle ABC$.


Proof













\(\ds 2 R\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac a {\sin A}\)





Law of Sines














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {a b c} {b c \sin A}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {a b c} {2 \AA}\)

Theorem
Let $T \subseteq S$ such that $\card S = n, \card T = m$.

Then:

$\card {\relcomp S T} = \card {S \setminus T} = n - m$
where:

$\relcomp S T$ denotes the complement of $T$ relative to $S$
$S \setminus T$ denotes the difference between $S$ and $T$.


Proof
The result is obvious for $S = T$ or $T = \O$.
Otherwise, $\set {T, S \setminus T}$ is a partition of $S$.
Let $\card {S \setminus T} = p$.
Then by the Fundamental Principle of Counting:

$m + p = n$
and the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

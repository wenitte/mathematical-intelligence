Theorem
Let $T = \struct {\CC, \tau_d}$ be the Cantor space.

Then $T$ is not scattered.


Proof
By definition, $T$ is scattered if and only if it contains no non-empty subset which is dense-in-itself.
We have that Cantor Space is Dense-in-itself.
Hence the result by definition of a scattered space.
$\blacksquare$

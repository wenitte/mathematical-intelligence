Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $1$
The Money Bag
"A bag," said Rackbrane, when helping himself to the marmalade, "contained fifty-five coins consisting entirely of crowns and shillings,
and their total value was $\pounds 7, \ 3 \shillings 0 \oldpence$
How many coins were there of each kind?"


Solution
$22$ crowns and $33$ shillings.


Proof
Let $c$ and $s$ be the number of crowns and shillings respectively.
Recall that:

$1$ crown is worth $5$ shillings
$1$ pound is worth $20$ shillings.
Hence:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds 5 c + s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 143\)





their total value was $\pounds 7, \ 3 \shillings 0 \oldpence$




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds c + s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 55\)





fifty-five coins consisting entirely of crowns and shillings








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 4 c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 88\)





$(1) - (2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds c\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 22\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 55 - 22\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 33\)









$\blacksquare$

Theorem
The only known pair of consecutive integers which are both powerful numbers such that the first of the pair is odd is:

$\tuple {675, 676}$


Proof
By investigation:














\(\ds 675\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3^3 \times 5^2\)




















\(\ds 676\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2^2 \times 13^2\)









That there are no smaller ones can be determined again by investigation.
$\blacksquare$

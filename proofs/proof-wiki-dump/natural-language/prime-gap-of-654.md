Theorem
There exists a prime gap of $654$ between $11\,000\,001\,446\,613\,353$ and $11\,000\,001\,446\,614\,007$.


Proof
$11\,000\,001\,446\,613\,353$ is a prime number.
$11\,000\,001\,446\,614\,007$ is a prime number.
It can be checked that all numbers between these two are composite.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This prime gap was reported by David Wells in his Curious and Interesting Numbers of $1986$ as being a record.
However, in $1993$ a prime gap of 864 was found between the smaller prime numbers $6 \, 505 \, 941 \, 701 \, 960 \, 039$ and $6 \, 505 \, 941 \, 701 \, 960 \, 903$, again by Sol Weintraub.

Theorem
Let $n \in \Z$ be an integer of the form:

$n = 6 k + 5$
where $k \in \Z$.
Then $n$ can also be expressed in the form:

$n = 3 k + 2$
for some other $k \in \Z$.

However it is not necessarily the case that if $n$ can be expressed in the form:

$n = 3 k + 2$
then it can also be expressed in the form:

$n = 6 k + 5$


Proof













\(\ds n\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 k + 5\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \paren {2 k} + 3 + 2\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3 \paren {2 k + 1} + 2\)





for some $2 k + 1 \in \Z$



Replacing $2 k + 1$ with $k$ gives the result.
$\Box$

Now consider $n = 8$.
We have that:

$8 = 3 \times 2 + 2$
and so can be expressed in the form:

$n = 3 k + 2$
However:

$8 = 6 \times 1 + 2$
and is in the form:

$n = 6 k + 2$
and so cannot be expressed in the form:

$n = 6 k + 5$
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Consider the one-parameter family of curves of graphs of the exponential function:

$(1): \quad y = c e^x$

Its family of orthogonal trajectories is given by the equation:

$y^2 = -2 x + c$





Proof
We use the technique of formation of ordinary differential equation by elimination.
Differentiating $(1)$ with respect to $x$ gives:

$\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} = c e^x$



\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds c e^x\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y\)





eliminating $c$ between $(1)$ and $(2)$




Thus from Orthogonal Trajectories of One-Parameter Family of Curves, the family of orthogonal trajectories is given by:

$\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} = -\dfrac 1 y$

So:














\(\ds \frac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac 1 y\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \int y \rd y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\int \rd x\)





Solution to Separable Differential Equation








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds y^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -2 x + c\)









Hence the result.

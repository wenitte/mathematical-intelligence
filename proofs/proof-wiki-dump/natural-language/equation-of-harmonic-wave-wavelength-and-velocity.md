Theorem
Let $\phi$ be a harmonic wave which is propagated along the $x$-axis in the positive direction with constant velocity $c$.
Then the disturbance of $\phi$ at point $x$ and time $t$ can be expressed using the equation:

$\map \phi {x, t} = a \map \cos {\dfrac {2 \pi} \lambda \paren {x - c t} }$
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of $\phi$


Proof













\(\ds \map \phi {x, t}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \map \cos {\omega \paren {x - c t} }\)





Equation of Harmonic Wave














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \map \cos {\dfrac {2 \pi} \lambda \paren {x - c t} }\)





Wavelength of Harmonic Wave: $\lambda = \dfrac {2 \pi} \omega$



$\blacksquare$

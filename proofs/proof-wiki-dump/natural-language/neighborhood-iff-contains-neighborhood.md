Theorem
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $x\in X$.
Let $V\subset X$ be a subset.

Then the following are equivalent:

$V$ is a neighborhood of $x$ in $X$
$V$ contains a neighborhood of $x$ in $X$


Proof
Follows directly from the definition of neighborhood and Subset Relation is Transitive.
$\blacksquare$

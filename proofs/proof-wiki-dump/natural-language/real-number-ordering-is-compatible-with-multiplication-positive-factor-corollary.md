Theorem
$\forall a, b, c, d \in \R: 0 < a < b \land 0 < c < d \implies a c < b d$

where $\R$ is the set of real numbers.


Proof













\(\ds a < b\)

\(\implies\)







\(\ds a \times c < b \times c\)





Real Number Ordering is Compatible with Multiplication: Positive Factor as $c > 0$














\(\ds c < d\)

\(\implies\)







\(\ds b \times c < b \times d\)





Real Number Ordering is Compatible with Multiplication: Positive Factor as $b > 0$



The result follows by the Transitive Law.
$\blacksquare$

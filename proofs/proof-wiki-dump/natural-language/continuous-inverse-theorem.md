Theorem
Let $f$ be a real function defined on an interval $I$.
Let $f$ be strictly monotone and continuous on $I$.
Let $g$ be the inverse mapping to $f$.
Let $J := f \left[{I}\right]$ be the image of $I$ under $f$.

Then $g$ is strictly monotone and continuous on $J$.


Proof
From Strictly Monotone Real Function is Bijective, $f$ is a bijection.
From Inverse of Strictly Monotone Function, $f^{-1} : J \to I$ exists and is strictly monotone.
From Surjective Monotone Function is Continuous, $f^{-1}$ is continuous.

Hence the result.

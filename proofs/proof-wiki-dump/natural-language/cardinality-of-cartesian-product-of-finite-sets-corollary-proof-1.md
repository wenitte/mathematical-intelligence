Corollary to Cardinality of Cartesian Product of Finite Sets
$\card {S \times T} = \card {T \times S}$


Proof













\(\ds \card {S \times T}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \card S \times \card T\)





Cardinality of Cartesian Product of Finite Sets














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \card T \times \card S\)





Integer Multiplication is Commutative














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \card {T \times S}\)

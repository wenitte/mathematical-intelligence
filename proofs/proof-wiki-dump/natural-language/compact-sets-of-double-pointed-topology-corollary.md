Corollary to Compact Sets of Double Pointed Topology
Let $\struct {S, \tau_S}$ be a topological space.
Let $D$ be a doubleton endowed with the indiscrete topology.
Let $\struct {S \times D, \tau}$ be the double pointed topology on $S$.

$\struct {S \times D, \tau}$ is compact if and only if $\struct {S, \tau_S}$ is compact.


Proof
By Projection is Surjection, it follows that:

$\map {\pr_1} {S \times D} = S$
where $\pr_1$ is the first projection on $S \times D$.
The result follows by Compact Sets of Double Pointed Topology.
$\blacksquare$

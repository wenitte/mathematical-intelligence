Theorem
Let $k$ be a topological field.
Let $X$ be a topological vector space over $X$. 
Let $K$ be a compact subset of $X$. 
Let $t \in k \setminus \set {0_k}$. 

Then $t K$ is compact.


Proof
From Dilation Mapping on Topological Vector Space is Continuous, the mapping $c_tÂ : X \to X$ defined by:

$\map {c_t} x = t x$
for each $x \in X$ is continuous.
From Continuous Image of Compact Space is Compact:

$\map {c_t} K = t K$ is compact.
$\blacksquare$

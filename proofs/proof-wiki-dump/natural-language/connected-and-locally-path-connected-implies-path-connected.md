Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a connected and locally path-connected topological space.

Then $T$ is path-connected.


Proof
By:

Path Component of Locally Path-Connected Space is Closed
Path Component of Locally Path-Connected Space is Open
the path components of $T$ are clopen.
Because $T$ is connected, every path component equals $S$.
That is, $T$ is path-connected.
$\blacksquare$

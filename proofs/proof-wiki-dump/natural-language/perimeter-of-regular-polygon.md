Theorem
Let $P$ be a regular $n$-sided polygon whose side length is $b$.
Then the perimeter $L$ of $P$ is given by:

$L = n b$


Proof
By definition, an $n$-sided polygon has $n$ sides.
By definition, a regular polygon has sides all the same length.
By definition, the perimeter of a polygon is the total length of all its sides.
Thus $P$ has $n$ sides all of length $b$.
Hence $L = n b$.
$\blacksquare$

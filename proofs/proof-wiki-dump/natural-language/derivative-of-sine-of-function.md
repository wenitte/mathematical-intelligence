Theorem
Let $u$ be a differentiable real function of $x$.
Then:

$\map {\dfrac \d {\d x} } {\sin u} = \cos u \dfrac {\d u} {\d x}$
where $\sin$ is the sine function and $\cos$ is the cosine function.


Proof













\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d x} } {\sin u}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map {\frac \d {\d u} } {\sin u} \frac {\d u} {\d x}\)





Chain Rule for Derivatives














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cos u \frac {\d u} {\d x}\)

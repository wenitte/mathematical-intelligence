Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $56$
The Ambiguous Clock
A man had a clock with an hour hand and minute hand of the same length and indistinguishable.
If it was set going at noon, what would be the first time that it would be impossible, by reason of the similarity of the hands, to be sure of the correct time?


Solution
$12:05 \tfrac 5 {143}$, where it cannot be distinguished from $01:00 \tfrac {60} {143}$.



Proof
See Ambiguous Times for full analysis.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be the Arens-Fort space.

Then $T$ is not a countably compact space.


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose the Arens-Fort space is countably compact.
From Arens-Fort Space is Lindelöf, it is also Lindelöf.
From Countably Compact Lindelöf Space is Compact, $T$ is compact.
But this contradicts  Arens-Fort Space is not Compact.
Hence the result from Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

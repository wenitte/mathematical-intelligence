Theorem
Let $z \in \C$ be a complex number.

Then the modulus of $z$ is larger than the real part $\map \Re z$ of $z$: 

$\cmod z \ge \size {\map \Re z}$


Proof
By the definition of a complex number, we have:

$z = \map \Re z + i \map \Im z$
Then:














\(\ds \cmod z\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sqrt {\paren {\map \Re z}^2 + \paren {\map \Im z}^2}\)





Definition of Complex Modulus














\(\ds \)

\(\ge\)







\(\ds \sqrt {\paren {\map \Re z}^2 }\)





Square of Real Number is Non-Negative, as $\map \Im z$ is real














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cmod {\map \Re z}\)





Square of Real Number is Non-Negative, as $\map \Re z$ is real



$\blacksquare$

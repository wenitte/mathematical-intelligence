Theorem
The real cotangent function is periodic with period $\pi$.


Proof













\(\ds \map \cot {x + \pi}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {\map \cos {x + \pi} } {\map \sin {x + \pi} }\)





Definition of Cotangent














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {-\cos x} {-\sin x}\)





Cosine of Angle plus Straight Angle, Sine of Angle plus Straight Angle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \cot x\)









Also, from Derivative of Cotangent Function:

$\map {D_x} {\cot x} = -\dfrac 1 {\sin^2 x}$
provided $\sin x \ne 0$.
From Shape of Sine Function, $\sin$ is strictly positive on the interval $\openint 0 \pi$.
From Derivative of Monotone Function, $\cot x$ is strictly decreasing on that interval, and hence cannot have a period of less than $\pi$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\phi: S \to T$ be an injection.
Then $\phi$ is a bijection if and only if its inverse $\phi^{-1}$ is also an injection.


Proof
Necessary Condition
Let $\phi$ be a bijection.
Then from Bijection iff Inverse is Bijection, its inverse $\phi^{-1}$ is also a bijection and therefore by definition an injection.
$\Box$


Sufficient Condition
Let $\phi$ be an injection such that $\phi^{-1}$ is also an injection.
By Cardinality of Codomain of Surjection, and the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr√∂der Theorem, the result follows.
$\blacksquare$

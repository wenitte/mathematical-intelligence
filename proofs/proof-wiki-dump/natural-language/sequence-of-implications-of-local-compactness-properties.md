Theorem
Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be compactness properties and let:

$P_1 \implies P_2$
mean:

If a topological space $T$ satsifies property $P_1$, then $T$ also satisfies property $P_2$.

Then the following sequence of implications holds:




Compact


$\implies$


Strongly Locally Compact



$\Big\Downarrow$





$\Big\Downarrow$



Weakly $\sigma$-Locally Compact


$\implies$


Weakly Locally Compact


$\Longleftarrow$


Locally Compact



$\Big\Downarrow$









$\sigma$-Compact









$\Big\Downarrow$









Lindelöf Space










Proof
The relevant justifications are listed as follows:

Compact Space is Strongly Locally Compact.
Strongly Locally Compact Space is Weakly Locally Compact.
Locally Compact Space is Weakly Locally Compact.
Compact Space is Weakly $\sigma$-Locally Compact.
A weakly $\sigma$-locally compact is both weakly locally compact and $\sigma$-compact by definition.
$\sigma$-Compact Space is Lindelöf.
$\blacksquare$

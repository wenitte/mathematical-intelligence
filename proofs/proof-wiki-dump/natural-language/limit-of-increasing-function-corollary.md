Corollary to Limit of Increasing Function
Let $f$ be a real function which is increasing on the open interval $\openint a b$.
If $\xi \in \openint a b$, then:

$\map f {\xi^-}$ and $\map f {\xi^+}$ both exist
and:

$\map f x \le \map f {\xi^-} \le \map f \xi \le \map f {\xi^+} \le \map f y$
provided that $a < x < \xi < y < b$.


Proof
$f$ is bounded above on $\openint a \xi$ by $\map f \xi$.


This article needs proofreading.In particular: Check the above limits of the interval with what it's got in the bookIf you believe all issues are dealt with, please remove {{Proofread}} from the code.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Proofread}} from the code.
By Limit of Increasing Function, the supremum is $\map f {\xi^-}$.
So it follows that:

$\forall x \in \openint a \xi: \map f x \le \map f {\xi^-} \le \map f \xi$
A similar argument for $\openint \xi b$ holds for the other inequalities.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $K_{m, n}$ be a complete bipartite graph.

$K_{2, 2}$ is the cycle graph $C_4$
and no other complete bipartite graphs are cycle graphs.


Proof
From Cycle Graph is 2-Regular, a cycle graph is $2$-regular.
From Complete Bipartite Graphs which are Regular, the only $2$-regular complete bipartite graph is $K_{2, 2}$.
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle.
Let $D$ be a point in the interior of $\triangle ABC$.
Then:

$AD$ is the angle bisector of $A$
$BD$ is the angle bisector of $B$
$CD$ is the angle bisector of $C$
if and only if:

$D$ is the incenter of $\triangle ABC$.


Proof



Necessary Condition
Let $D$ be the incenter of $\triangle ABC$.
Let $E$, $F$ and $G$ be the points on $AB$, $BC$ and $AC$ tangent to the incircle $\bigcirc EFG$ of $\triangle ABC$.
We have that:

$ED = DF$, as both equal the radius of $\bigcirc EFG$
$\angle BED = \angle BFD$, a right angle
$BD$ is common.
From Pythagoras's Theorem we have that:














\(\ds BD^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds DE^2 + EB^2\)





Pythagoras's Theorem

\(\ds DF^2 + FB^2\)

\(\ds FB\)





algebra



Hence by Triangle Side-Side-Side Congruence:

$\triangle EBD = \triangle FBD$
So:

$\angle EBD = \angle FBD$
and it is seen that $BD$ is the angle bisector of $B$.

By the same reasoning, mutatis mutandis:

$AD$ is the angle bisector of $A$
and

$CD$ is the angle bisector of $C$.
Hence the result.

Sufficient Condition
Let:

$AD$ be the angle bisector of $A$
$BD$ be the angle bisector of $B$
$CD$ be the angle bisector of $C$
It follows from Inscribing Circle in Triangle that $D$ is the incenter of $\triangle ABC$.

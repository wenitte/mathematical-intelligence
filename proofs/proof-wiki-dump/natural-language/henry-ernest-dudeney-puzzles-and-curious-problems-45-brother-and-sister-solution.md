Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $45$
Brother and Sister
A boy on being asked the age of himself and his sister replied:
"Three years ago I was seven times as old as my sister;
two years ago I was four times as old;
last year I was three times as old;
and this year I am two and one-half times as old."
What are their ages?


Solution
The boy is $10$, and his sister is $4$.


Proof
You need only two of the given statements to solve this.
Let $b$ and $s$ be the ages of the brother and sister respectively.
We have:














\(\ds b - 3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \paren {s - 3}\)





"Three years ago I was seven times as old as my sister;














\(\ds b - 2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \paren {s - 2}\)





two years ago I was four times as old;








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 s - 18\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 s - 6\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 3 s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 12\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds s\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds b\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {4 \times 4} - 6\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 10\)










The final two statements are redundant.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $b \in \Z$ be an integer such that $b > 1$.
Then $b$ is expressed in base $b$ as $10$.


Proof
By the Basis Representation Theorem, $b$ can be expressed uniquely in the form:

$\ds b = \sum_{j \mathop = 0}^m r_j b^j$
where:

$m$ is such that $b^m \le n < b^{m + 1}$
all the $r_j$ are such that $0 \le r_j < b$.
As $b = b^1$, we have that:

$b = 1 \times b^1 + 0 \times b^0$
That is, by definition of base $b$:

$b = \sqbrk {1 0}_b$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$


Examples
Base $10$
The number ten is expressed in decimal notation as $10$.


Base $2$
The number $2$ (two) is expressed in binary notation as $10$.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a topological space.
Let $T^*_{\bar p} = \struct {S^*_p, \tau^*_{\bar p} }$ be the open extension space of $T$.

Then $T^*_{\bar p}$ is ultraconnected.


Proof
Apart from $S^*_p$, every open set of $T^*_{\bar p}$ does not contain $p$, by definition of open extension space.
So, apart from $\O$, every closed set of $T$ does contain $p$, by definition of closed set.
So every pair of closed sets of $T$ has an intersection which contains at least $p$.
So there are no non-empty disjoint closed sets of $T$.
Hence the result, by definition of ultraconnected.
$\blacksquare$

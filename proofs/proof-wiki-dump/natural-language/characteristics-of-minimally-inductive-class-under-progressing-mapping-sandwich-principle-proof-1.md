Theorem
Let $M$ be a class which is minimally inductive under a progressing mapping $g$.
Then for all $x, y \in M$:

$x \subseteq y \subseteq \map g x \implies x = y \lor y = \map g x$


Proof
From Minimally Inductive Class under Progressing Mapping induces Nest, we have that $M$ is a nest in which:

$\forall x, y \in M: \map g x \subseteq y \lor y \subseteq x$
Thus the Sandwich Principle applies directly.
$\blacksquare$

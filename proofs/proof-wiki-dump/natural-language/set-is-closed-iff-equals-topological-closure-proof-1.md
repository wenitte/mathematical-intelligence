Theorem
Let $T$ be a topological space.
Let $H \subseteq T$.

Then $H$ is closed in $T$ if and only if:

$H = \map \cl H$


Proof
Let $H'$ denote the derived set of $H$.

By Closed Set iff Contains all its Limit Points, $H$ is closed in $T$ if and only if $H' \subseteq H$.
By Union with Superset is Superset, $H' \subseteq H$ if and only if $H = H \cup H'$.
The result follows from the definition of closure.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Consider a pentagram.


Let $AC$ be the length of one of the lines which span the pentagram and define it.
Let $B$ be one of the points where $AC$ intersects one of the other such lines such that $AB > AC$.
Then:

$\dfrac {AC} {AB} = \phi$
where $\phi$ denotes the golden mean.


Proof
Follows directly from Straight Lines Subtending Two Consecutive Angles in Regular Pentagon cut in Extreme and Mean Ratio.
$\blacksquare$

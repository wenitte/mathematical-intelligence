Theorem
$\map \Gamma {\dfrac 1 2} = \sqrt \pi$


Proof

Due to the organization of pages at $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$, this argument is circular.In particular: This uses Gamma Function of Positive Half-Integer in its proof, which itself uses Gamma Function of One Half, so it's circular.You can help $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$ by resolving this issue.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{CircularStructure}} from the code.If you would welcome a second opinion as to whether your work is correct, add a call to {{Proofread}} the page.

Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a countable discrete topological space.

Then $T$ is separable.


Proof 1
Let $T = \left({S, \tau}\right)$ be a countable discrete topological space.
From Countable Discrete Space is Second-Countable:

$T$ is second-countable.
From Second-Countable Space is Separable:

$T$ is separable.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
Follows immediately from Countable Space is Separable.
$\blacksquare$

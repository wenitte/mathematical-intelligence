Arithmetical Epigram of Metrodorus
Tell me the transits of the fixed stars and planets when my wife gave birth to a child yesterday.
It was day, and till the sun set in the western sea it wanted six times two-sevenths of the time since dawn.


Solution
Let $t$ be the time since dawn that the birth happened.
It is assumed that the day is $12$ hours long.

We have:














\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 6 \times \dfrac 2 7 \paren {12 - t}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 7 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 144 - 12 t\)





multiplying through by $7$ to clear the fractions and simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 19 t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 144\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds t\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \frac {144} {19}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 7 \frac {11} {19}\)










So $7 \frac {11} {19}$ hours had passed since dawn when the baby was born.
That leaves $12 - 7 \frac {11} {19} = 4 \frac 8 {19}$ hours remaining till sunset.
$\blacksquare$

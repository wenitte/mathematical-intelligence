Theorem
Let $\struct {F, +, \times}$ be a field whose zero is $0_F$ and whose unity is $1_F$.
Then $\struct {F, +, \times}$ has no proper zero divisors.
That is:

$a \times b = 0_F \implies a = 0_F \lor b = 0_F$


Proof
By definition, $F$ is a division ring.
Again by definition, a division ring is a ring with unity with no proper zero divisors.
$\blacksquare$

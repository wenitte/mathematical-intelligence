Theorem
Let $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ be a Lindelöf space which is also countably compact.

Then $T$ is compact.


Proof
By the definitions:

If $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ is a Lindelöf space then every open cover of $S$ has a countable subcover.
If $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ is a countably compact space then every countable open cover of $S$ has a finite subcover.
It follows trivially that every open cover of $S$ has a finite subcover.
Hence the result by definition of compact.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be straight lines in the Cartesian plane.
Let the slope of $L_1$ and $L_2$ be $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ respectively.

Then $L_1$ is perpendicular to $L_2$ if and only if:

$\mu_1 = -\dfrac 1 {\mu_2}$


Proof 1
Let $\mu_1 = \tan \phi$.
Then $L_1$ is perpendicular to $L_2$ if and only if:














\(\ds \mu_2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \tan {\phi + \dfrac \pi 2}\)





Definition of Perpendicular














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\cot \phi\)





Tangent of Angle plus Right Angle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac 1 {\tan \phi}\)





Definition of Cotangent of Angle














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac 1 {\mu_1}\)





Definition of $\mu_1$



$\blacksquare$


Proof 2
This is a special case of Slope of Orthogonal Curves.
$\blacksquare$


Proof 3
Let $\psi$ be the angle between $L_1$ and $L_2$
From Angle between Straight Lines in Plane:

$\psi = \arctan \dfrac {m_1 - m_2} {1 + m_1 m_2}$
When $L_1$ and $L_2$ are perpendicular:

$\psi = \dfrac \pi 2$
by definition.

From Tangent of Right Angle $\tan \dfrac \pi 2$ is undefined.
This happens if and only if $1 + m_1 m_2 = 0$. 
The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

This can also be presented in the elegant form:

$\mu_1 \mu_2 + 1 = 0$
or:

$\mu_1 \mu_2 = -1$

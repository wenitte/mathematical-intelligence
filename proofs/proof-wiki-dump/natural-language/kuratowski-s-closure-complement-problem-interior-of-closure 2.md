Theorem
Let $\R$ be the real number line with the usual (Euclidean) topology.
Let $A \subseteq \R$ be defined as:














\(\ds A\)

\(:=\)







\(\ds \openint 0 1 \cup \openint 1 2\)





Definition of Union of Adjacent Open Intervals














\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds \cup \, \)

\(\ds \set 3\)





Definition of Singleton














\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds \cup \, \)

\(\ds \paren {\Q \cap \openint 4 5}\)





Rational Numbers from $4$ to $5$ (not inclusive)




The interior of the closure of $A$ in $\R$ is given by:














\(\ds A^{- \, \circ}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \openint 0 2\)





Definition of Open Real Interval














\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds \cup \, \)

\(\ds \openint 4 5\)





Definition of Open Real Interval








Proof
From Kuratowski's Closure-Complement Problem: Closure:














\(\ds A^-\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \closedint 0 2\)





Definition of Closed Real Interval














\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds \cup \, \)

\(\ds \set 3\)





Definition of Singleton














\(\ds \)

\(\)





\(\, \ds \cup \, \)

\(\ds \closedint 4 5\)





Definition of Closed Real Interval




From Interior of Closed Real Interval is Open Real Interval:

$\closedint 0 2^\circ = \openint 0 2$
and:

$\closedint 4 5^\circ = \openint 4 5$
From Interior of Singleton in Real Number Line is Empty:

$\set 3^\circ = \O$

Example of Integers such that Difference with Power of 2 is always Prime
The positive integer $45$ has the property that such that:

$\forall k > 0: 45 - 2^k$
is prime whenever it is (strictly) positive.


Proof













\(\ds 45 - 2^1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 43\)





which is prime














\(\ds 45 - 2^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 41\)





which is prime














\(\ds 45 - 2^3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 37\)





which is prime














\(\ds 45 - 2^4\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 29\)





which is prime














\(\ds 45 - 2^5\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 13\)





which is prime














\(\ds 45 - 2^6\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -19\)





which is not positive



$\blacksquare$

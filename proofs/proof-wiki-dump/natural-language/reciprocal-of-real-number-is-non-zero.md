Theorem
$\forall x \in \R: x \ne 0 \implies \dfrac 1 x \ne 0$


Proof
Aiming for a contradiction, suppose that:

$\exists x \in \R_{\ne 0}: \dfrac 1 x = 0$
From Real Zero is Zero Element

$\dfrac 1 x \times x = 0$
But from Real Number Axiom $\R \text M4$: Inverses for Multiplication:

$\dfrac 1 x \times x = 1$
The result follows by Proof by Contradiction.
$\blacksquare$

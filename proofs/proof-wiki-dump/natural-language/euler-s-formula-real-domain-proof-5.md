Theorem
Let $\theta \in \R$ be a real number.
Then:

$e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$


Proof
As Sine Function is Absolutely Convergent and Cosine Function is Absolutely Convergent, we have:














\(\ds \cos \theta + i \sin \theta\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sum_{n \mathop = 0}^\infty \paren {-1}^n \dfrac {\theta^{2 n} } {\paren {2 n}!} + i \sum_{n \mathop = 0}^\infty \paren {-1}^n \dfrac {\theta^{2 n + 1} } {\paren {2 n + 1}!}\)

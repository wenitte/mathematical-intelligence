Theorem
Let $\R$ be the real number line considered as an Euclidean space.
Let $\closedint a b \subset \R$ be a closed interval of $\R$.

Then $\closedint a b$ is not an open set of $\R$.


Proof
From Closed Real Interval is Neighborhood Except at Endpoints, $a$ and $b$ have no open $\epsilon$-ball lying entirely in $\closedint a b$.
The result follows by definition of open set.
$\blacksquare$

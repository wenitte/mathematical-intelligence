Theorem
Let $S$ be the set of straight lines in the plane.
For $l_1, l_2 \in S$, let $l_1 \perp l_2$ denote that $l_1$ is perpendicular to $l_2$.

Then $\perp$ is an antireflexive relation on $S$.


Proof
By definition of perpendicular lines, for $l_1$ to be perpendicular to itself would mean it would have to meet itself in a right angle.
This it does not do.
So $l_1 \not \perp l_1$.
Thus $\perp$ is seen to be antireflexive.
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let the Axiom of Choice be accepted.
Then the Maximal Principles hold.


Proof
From Maximal Principles are Equivalent, it is sufficient to demonstrate that any one of them is implied by the Axiom of Choice.

Indeed, we have several such theorems:

Axiom of Choice implies Kuratowski's Lemma
Axiom of Choice implies Tukey's Lemma
Axiom of Choice implies Zorn's Lemma
Axiom of Choice implies Hausdorff's Maximal Principle
$\blacksquare$

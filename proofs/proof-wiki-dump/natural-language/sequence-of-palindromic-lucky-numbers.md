Theorem
The The sequence of lucky numbers which are also palindromic begins:

$1, 3, 7, 9, 33, 99, 111, 141, 151, 171, \ldots$
This sequence is A031161 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (N. J. A. Sloane (Ed.), 2008).


Proof
The sequence of lucky numbers begins:

$1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 31, 33, 37, 43, 49, 51, 63, 67, 69, 73, 75, 79, 87, 93, 99, \ldots$

Of these, the palindromic ones can be picked out by inspection.

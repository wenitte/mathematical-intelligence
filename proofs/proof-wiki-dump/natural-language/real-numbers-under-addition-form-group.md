Theorem
Let $\R$ be the set of real numbers.
The structure $\struct {\R, +}$ is a group.


Proof
Taking the group axioms in turn:


Group Axiom $\text G 0$: Closure
Real Addition is Closed.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 1$: Associativity
Real Addition is Associative.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 2$: Existence of Identity Element
From Real Addition Identity is Zero, we have that the identity element of $\struct {\R, +}$ is the real number $0$.
$\Box$


Group Axiom $\text G 3$: Existence of Inverse Element
From Inverse for Real Addition, we have that the inverse of $x \in \struct {\R, +}$ is $-x$.
$\blacksquare$

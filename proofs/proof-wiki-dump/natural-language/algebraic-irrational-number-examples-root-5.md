Example of Algebraic Irrational Number
The number $\sqrt 5$ is an example of an algebraic irrational number.


Proof
We have that $\sqrt 5$ is the root of the polynomial equation $x^2 - 5 = 0$.
Hence by definition $\sqrt 5$ is an algebraic number.
From Square Root of Prime is Irrational, $\sqrt 5$ is also irrational.
Hence the result, by definition of algebraic irrational number.
$\blacksquare$

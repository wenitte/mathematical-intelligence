Example of Integers such that Difference with Power of 2 is always Prime
The positive integer $7$ has the property that such that:

$\forall k > 0: 7 - 2^k$
is prime whenever it is (strictly) positive.


Proof













\(\ds 7 - 2^1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 5\)





which is prime














\(\ds 4 - 2^2\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 3\)





which is prime














\(\ds 7 - 2^3\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -1\)





which is not positive



$\blacksquare$

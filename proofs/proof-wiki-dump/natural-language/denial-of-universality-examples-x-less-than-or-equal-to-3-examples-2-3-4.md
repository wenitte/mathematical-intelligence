Example of Denial of Universality: $\forall x \in S: x \le 3$
Let $P$ be the statement:

$\forall x \in S: x \le 3$
and $\lnot P$ its negation:

$\exists x \in S: x > 3$

Let $S = \set {2, 3, 4}$.
Then we have that:

$P$ is false
and consequently:

$\lnot P$ is true


Proof
The falsehood of $P$ can be demonstrated by citing $x \in S: x = 4$.
Thus $4$ is a counterexample to the assertion that all $x \in S$ are such that $x \le 3$.
Hence its negation is true.
$\blacksquare$

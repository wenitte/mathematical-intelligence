Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $21$
The Cost of a Suit
Melville bought a suit.
The jacket cost as much as the trousers and waistcoat.
The jacket and two pairs of trousers would cost $\pounds 7, 17 \shillings 6 \oldpence$
The trousers and two waistcoats would cost $\pounds 4, 10 \shillings$
Can you tell me the cost of the suit?


Solution
The jacket costs $\pounds 3, 7 \shillings 6 \oldpence$
The trousers cost $\pounds 2, 5 \shillings$
The waistcoat costs $\pounds 1, 2 \shillings 6 \oldpence$
In total: $\pounds 6, 15 \shillings$


Proof
Let us do all this in shillings.
Hence:














\(\ds \pounds 7, 17 \shillings 6 \oldpence\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 157 \tfrac 1 2 \shillings\)




















\(\ds \pounds 4, 10 \shillings\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 90 \shillings\)









Then we have:




\(\text {(1)}: \quad\)









\(\ds J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds T + W\)





The jacket cost as much as the trousers and waistcoat.




\(\text {(2)}: \quad\)









\(\ds J + 2 T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 157 \tfrac 1 2\)





The jacket and two pairs of trousers would cost $\pounds 7, 17 \shillings 6 \oldpence$




\(\text {(3)}: \quad\)









\(\ds T + 2 W\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 90\)





The trousers and two waistcoats would cost $\pounds 4, 10 \shillings$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds T + W + 2 T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 157 \tfrac 1 2\)





substituting for $J$ from $(1)$ into $(2)$




\(\text {(4)}: \quad\)



\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 6 T + 2 W\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 315\)





simplifying and clearing the fraction








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 5 T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 225\)





$(4) - (3)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds T\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 45\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds 45 + 2 W\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 90\)





substituting into $(2)$








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds W\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 22 \tfrac 1 2\)





simplifying








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds J\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 45 + 22 \tfrac 1 2\)





substituting into $(1)$














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 67 \tfrac 1 2\)





simplifying



where $J$, $T$ and $W$ are used in the obvious way.
The given solution shows these prices converted back into pounds, shillings and pence.

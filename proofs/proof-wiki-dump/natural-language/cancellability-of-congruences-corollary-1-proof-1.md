Corollary to Cancellability of Congruences
Let $c$ and $n$ be coprime integers, that is:

$c \perp n$
Then:

$c a \equiv c b \pmod n \implies a \equiv b \pmod n$


Proof
Recall that $c \perp n$ means $\gcd \set {c, n} = 1$.
The result follows directly from Cancellability of Congruences.
$\blacksquare$

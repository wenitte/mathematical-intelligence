Theorem
Let $S$ be a set.
Let $\struct {S, \to}$ be the algebraic structure formed from $S$ under the right operation.
Let $f$ be a permutation on $S$.

Then $f$ is an automorphism of $f$.


Proof
We have by hypothesis that $f$ is a permutation and so a fortiori a bijection.
It remains to show that $f$ is a homomorphism.

So, let $a, b \in S$ be arbitrary.
We have:














\(\ds \map f {a \to b}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f b\)





Definition of Right Operation














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds \map f a \to \map f b\)





Definition of Right Operation



The result follows.
$\blacksquare$

Puzzles and Curious Problems by Henry Ernest Dudeney: $10$
Mental Arithmetic
If a tobacconist offers a cigar at $7 \tfrac 3 4 \oldpence$,
but says we can have the box of $100$ for $65 \shillings$,
shall we save much by buying the box?
In other words, what would $100$ at $7 \tfrac 3 4 \oldpence$ cost?
By a little rule that we shall give the calculation takes only a few moments.


Solution
Buying a box of $100$ is actually $5 \oldpence$ more than buying the cigars individually.
One presumes that the box itself must have an intrinsic worth of $5 \oldpence$.

The rule for calculating the price of $100$ of something costing $n \oldpence$ is:

reduce $n \oldpence$ to farthings to get $4 n$ farthings
double this amount to get $8 n$.
add $8 n \shillings$ to $4 n \oldpence$ to get the price of $100$.


Proof
We have:

$100 \times 7 \tfrac 3 4 = 700 + 3 \times 25 = 775$
But:

$775 \oldpence = 64 \shillings 7 \oldpence$
which is $5 \oldpence$ less than buying the whole box.
One presumes that the box itself may have an intrinsic worth of $5 \oldpence$.

Let $n$ be the number of (old) pennies an item costs.
Hence its cost in farthings is $4 n$.
Then $100$ of them cost $100 n \oldpence$ 
This is $400 n$ farthings.
This is:

$\dfrac {400 n} {48} \shillings = {\dfrac {384 n} {48} \shillings} + 16 n \times {\tfrac 1 4 \oldpence}$
That is:

$100 n \oldpence = {8 n \shillings} + {4 n \oldpence}$
$\blacksquare$

Example of Matrix Entrywise Addition forms Abelian Group
Let $\R^{n \times n}$ denote the set of order $n$ square matrices over the set $\R$ of real numbers.
Then the algebraic structure $\struct {\R^{n \times n}, +}$, where $+$ denotes matrix entrywise addition, is an abelian group.


Proof
From Real Numbers under Addition form Infinite Abelian Group, $\struct {\R, +}$ is an abelian group.
It follows from Matrix Entrywise Addition forms Abelian Group that $\struct {\R^{n \times n}, +}$ is an abelian group.

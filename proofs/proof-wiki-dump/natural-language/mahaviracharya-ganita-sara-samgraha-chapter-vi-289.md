Mahaviracharya: Ganita Sara Samgraha Chapter $\text {VI}$: Mixed Problems: Problem $289$
Arrows, if they are thin cylinders, circular in cross-section, can be packed in hexagonal bundles.
Let the arrows around the circumference be $18$ in number.
How many in all are the arrows to be found in the bundle in the quiver?


Solution
$37$


Proof
The arrows are packed as centered hexagonal numbers.

The first few centered hexagonal numbers are as follows:





Sequence of Centered Hexagonal Numbers
The sequence of centered hexagonal numbers, for $n \in \Z_{> 0}$, begins:

$1, 7, 19, 37, 61, 91, 127, 169, 217, 271, 331, 397, 469, 547, 631, 721, 817, 919, \ldots$

The answer is immediately apparent.
$\blacksquare$

Examples of First Supplement to Law of Quadratic Reciprocity
$-1$ is a quadratic residue of $17$.


Proof
From Quadratic Residues of 17:

the set of quadratic residues modulo $13$ is:
$\set {1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16}$
and so $-1 \equiv 16 \pmod {17}$ is therefore a quadratic residue of $17$.

We also have that:

$17 = 4 \times 4 + 1$
and so is of the form $4 n + 1$.
$\blacksquare$

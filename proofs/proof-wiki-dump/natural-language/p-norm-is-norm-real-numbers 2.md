This page has been identified as a candidate for refactoring.In particular: Establish what the context of this is -- finite or infinite sequences? This area is incoherent.Until this has been finished, please leave {{Refactor}} in the code.
New contributors: Refactoring is a task which is expected to be undertaken by experienced editors only.

Because of the underlying complexity of the work needed, it is recommended that you do not embark on a refactoring task until you have become familiar with the structural nature of pages of $\mathsf{Pr} \infty \mathsf{fWiki}$.To discuss this page in more detail, feel free to use the talk page.When this work has been completed, you may remove this instance of {{Refactor}} from the code.
Theorem
The $p$-norm on the real numbers is a norm.


Proof
We have that $p$-norm is a norm on complex numbers.
Since real numbers are wholly real complex numbers, the same result holds.
$\blacksquare$

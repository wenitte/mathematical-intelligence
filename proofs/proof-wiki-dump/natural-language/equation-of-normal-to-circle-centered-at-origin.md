Theorem
Let $\CC$ be a circle whose radius is $r$ and whose center is at the origin of a Cartesian plane.
Let $P = \tuple {x_1, y_1}$ be a point on $\CC$.
Let $\NN$ be a normal to $\CC$ passing through $P$.

Then $\NN$ can be defined by the equation:

$y_1 x - x_1 y = 0$


Proof
Let $\TT$ be the tangent to $\CC$ passing through $P$.
From Equation of Tangent to Circle Centered at Origin, $\TT$ can be described using the equation:

$x x_1 + y y_1 = r^2$
expressible as:

$y - y_1 = -\dfrac {x_1} {y_1} \paren {x - x_1}$
where the slope of $\TT$ is $-\dfrac {x_1} {y_1}$.

By definition, the normal is perpendicular to the tangent.
From Condition for Straight Lines in Plane to be Perpendicular, the slope of $\NN$ is $\dfrac {y_1} {x_1}$
Hence the equation for $\NN$ is:














\(\ds y - y_1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \dfrac {y_1} {x_1} \paren {x - x_1}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x_1 \paren {y - y_1}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y_1 \paren {x - x_1}\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x_1 y\)

\(=\)







\(\ds y_1 x\)









Hence the result.

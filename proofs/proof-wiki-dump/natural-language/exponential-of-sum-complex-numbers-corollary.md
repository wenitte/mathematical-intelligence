Corollary to Exponential of Sum: Complex Numbers
Let $z_1, z_2 \in \C$ be complex numbers.
Let $\exp z$ be the exponential of $z$.

Then:

$\map \exp {z_1 - z_2} = \dfrac {\exp z_1} {\exp z_2}$


Proof
By Exponential of Sum: Complex Numbers:

$\map \exp {z_1 - z_2} = \exp z_1 \, \map \exp {-z_2}$
By Reciprocal of Complex Exponential:

$\dfrac 1 {\exp z_2} = \map \exp {-z_2}$
Combining these two, we obtain the result:

$\map \exp {z_1 - z_2} = \dfrac {\exp z_1} {\exp z_2}$
$\blacksquare$

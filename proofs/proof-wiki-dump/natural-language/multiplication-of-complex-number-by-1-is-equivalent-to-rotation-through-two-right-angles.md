Theorem
Let $z \in \C$ be a complex number.
Let $z$ be interpreted as a vector in the complex plane.
Let $w \in \C$ be the complex number defined as $z$ multiplied by $-1$:

$w = \left({-1}\right) z$

Then $w$ can be interpreted as the vector $z$ after being rotated through two right angles.

The direction of rotation is usually interpreted as being anticlockwise, but a rotated through two right angles is the same whichever direction the rotation is performed.


Proof


By definition of the imaginary unit:

$-1 = i^2$
and so:

$-1 \times z = i \paren {i z}$

From Multiplication by Imaginary Unit is Equivalent to Rotation through Right Angle, multiplication by $i$ is equivalent to rotation through a right angle, in an anticlockwise direction.
So multiplying by $i^2$ is equivalent to rotation through two right angles in an anticlockwise direction.
$\blacksquare$

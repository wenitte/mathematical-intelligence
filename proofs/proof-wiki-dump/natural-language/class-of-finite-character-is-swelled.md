Theorem
Let $A$ be a class which has finite character.
Then $A$ is a swelled class.


Proof
Let $x \in A$ and $y \subseteq x$.
Then by hypothesis every finite subset of $y$ is also a finite subset of $x$.
Hence every finite subset of $y$ is in $A$.
Hence again by hypothesis $y \in A$.
$\blacksquare$

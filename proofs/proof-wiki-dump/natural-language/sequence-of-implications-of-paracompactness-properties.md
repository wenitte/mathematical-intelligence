Theorem
Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be paracompactness properties and let:

$P_1 \implies P_2$
mean:

If a topological space $T$ satsifies property $P_1$, then $T$ also satisfies property $P_2$.

Then the following sequence of implications holds:











Compact


$\implies$


Countably Compact









$\Big\Downarrow$





$\Big\Downarrow$



Fully Normal


$\implies$


Paracompact


$\implies$


Countably Paracompact



$\Big\Downarrow$





$\Big\Downarrow$





$\Big\Downarrow$



Fully $T_4$





Metacompact


$\implies$


Countably Metacompact



$\Big\Downarrow$















$T_4$
















Proof
The relevant justifications are listed as follows:

Compact Space is Countably Compact.
Compact Space is Paracompact.
Fully Normal Space is Paracompact.
Countably Compact Space is Countably Paracompact.
Paracompact Space is Countably Paracompact.
Fully Normal Space is Fully $T_4$ by definition.
Fully $T_4$ Space is $T_4$.
Paracompact Space is Metacompact.
Metacompact Space is Countably Metacompact.
Countably Paracompact Space is Countably Metacompact.
$\blacksquare$

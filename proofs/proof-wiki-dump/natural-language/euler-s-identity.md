Theorem
$e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$


Proof
Follows directly from Euler's Formula $e^{i z} = \cos z + i \sin z$, by plugging in $z = \pi$:

$e^{i \pi} + 1 = \cos \pi + i \sin \pi + 1 = -1 + i \times 0 + 1 = 0$
$\blacksquare$


Also presented as
Euler's Identity can also be presented as:

$e^{i \pi} = -1$
or:

$e^{\pi i} = -1$

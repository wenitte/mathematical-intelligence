Theorem
Let $p$ and $q$ be prime numbers such that $q$ is a divisor of the Mersenne number $M_p$.
Then:

$q \equiv 1 \pmod p$


Proof
Let $q \divides M_p$.
From Factor of Mersenne Number $M_p$ is of form $2 k p + 1$: 

$q = 2 k p + 1$
and so by definition of congruence modulo an integer:

$q \equiv 1 \pmod p$
immediately.
$\blacksquare$

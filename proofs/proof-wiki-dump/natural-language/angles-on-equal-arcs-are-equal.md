Theorem
In equal circles, angles standing on equal arcs are equal to one another, whether at the center or at the circumference of those circles.

In the words of Euclid:

In equal circles angles standing on equal circumferences are equal to one another, whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences.
(The Elements: Book $\text{III}$: Proposition $27$)


Proof
Let $ABC$ and $DEF$ be equal circles.
Let $\angle BGC$ and $\angle EHF$ stand on the equal arcs $BC$ and $EF$.


Suppose $\angle BGC \ne \angle EHF$.
Then one of them is bigger.
Suppose $\angle BGC > \angle EHF$.
On the straight line $BG$, construct $\angle BGK$ equal to $\angle EHF$.
From Equal Angles in Equal Circles, these angles stand on equal arcs.
So arcs $BK = EF$.
But $EF = BC$ and so $BK = BC$, which is impossible.
So $\angle BGC$ and $\angle EHF$ are not unequal, therefore $\angle BGC = \angle EHF$.

From the Inscribed Angle Theorem, $2 \angle BAC = \angle BGC$ and $2 \angle EDF = \angle EHF$.
Therefore $2 \angle BAC = \angle EHF$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $27$ of Book $\text{III}$ of Euclid's The Elements. It is the converse of Proposition $26$: Equal Angles in Equal Circles.

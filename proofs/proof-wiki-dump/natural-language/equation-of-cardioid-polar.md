Theorem
Let $C$ be a cardioid embedded in a polar coordinate plane such that:

its deferent of radius $a$ is positioned with its center at $\polar {a, 0}$
there is a cusp at the origin.
The polar equation of $C$ is:

$r = 2 a \paren {1 + \cos \theta}$


Proof


Let $P = \polar {r, \theta}$ be an arbitrary point on $C$.
Let $A$ and $B$ be the centers of the deferent and epicycle respectively.
Let $Q$ be the point where the deferent and epicycle touch.
By definition of the method of construction of $C$, we have that the arc $OQ$ of the deferent equals the arc $PQ$ of the epicycle.
Thus:

$\angle OAQ = \angle PBQ$
and it follows that $AB$ is parallel to $OP$.

With reference to the diagram above, we have:














\(\ds r\)

\(=\)







\(\ds OR + RS + SP\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \cos \theta + 2 a + a \cos \theta\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 a \paren {1 + \cos \theta}\)









and the result follows.

The polar equation for the cardioid can also be seen presented as:

$r = a \paren {1 + \cos \theta}$

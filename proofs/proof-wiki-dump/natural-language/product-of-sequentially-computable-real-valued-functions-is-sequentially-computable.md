Theorem
Let $D \subseteq \R^n$ be a subset of real cartesian $n$-space.
Let $f, g : D \to \R$ be sequentially computable.
Then, $h : D \to \R$ defined as:

$\map h \bsx = \map f \bsx \map g \bsx$
is sequentially computable.


Proof
Follows immediately from:

Real Multiplication is Sequentially Computable
Composition of Sequentially Computable Real-Valued Functions is Sequentially Computable
$\blacksquare$

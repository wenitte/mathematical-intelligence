Theorem
Let $T = \struct{X, \tau}$ be a topological space.

If every open cover of $T$ has an open $\sigma$-locally finite refinement then:

every open cover of $T$ has a locally finite refinement
Proof
Let every open cover of $T$ have an open $\sigma$-locally finite refinement.

Let $\UU$ be an open cover of $T$.

Let $\VV$ be an open $\sigma$-locally finite refinement of $\UU$ by hypothesis.

From Sigma-Locally Finite Cover has Locally Finite Refinement:

there exists a locally finite refinement $\AA$ of $\VV$

From Refinement of a Refinement is Refinement of Cover:

$\AA$ is a locally finite refinement of $\UU$

Since $\UU$ was arbitrary, it follows that:

every open cover of $T$ has a locally finite refinement
$\blacksquare$

Theorem
Let $S$ be a class.
Suppose the rank, denoted $\map {\operatorname{rank} } x$, of each $x \in S$ is bounded above by some ordinal $y$.

Then $S$ is a small class.

Let $V$ denote the von Neumann hierarchy.
Then:










\(\ds \forall x \in S: \, \)



\(\ds \map {\operatorname{rank} } x\)

\(\le\)







\(\ds y\)





by hypothesis








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds x\)

\(\in\)







\(\ds \map V {y + 1}\)





Ordinal is Subset of Rank of Small Class iff Not in Von Neumann Hierarchy and Ordinal Equal to Rank








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds S\)

\(\subseteq\)







\(\ds \map V {y + 1}\)





Definition of Subset




Therefore, by Axiom of Subsets Equivalents, it follows that $S$ is a small class.

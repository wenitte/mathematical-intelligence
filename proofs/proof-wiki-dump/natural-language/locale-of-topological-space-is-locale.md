Theorem
Let $T = \struct{S, \tau}$ be a topological space.

Let $\map \Omega T$ denote the locale of $T$. 

Then:

$\map \Omega T$ is a locale


Proof
By definition of frame of topological space:

the frame of $T$ is $\map \Omega T$
From Frame of Topological Space is Frame:

$\map \Omega T$ is a frame
By definition of locale:

$\map \Omega T$ is a locale
$\blacksquare$

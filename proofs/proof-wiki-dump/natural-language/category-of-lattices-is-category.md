Theorem
Let $\mathbf{Lat}$ denote the category of lattices.

Then:

$\mathbf{Lat}$ is a metacategory
Proof
Let us verify the axioms $(\text C 1)$ up to $(\text C 3)$ for a metacategory.

For any two lattice homomorphisms their composition (in the usual set theoretic sense) is again a lattice homomorphism by Composite Lattice Homomorphisms is Lattice Homomorphism.

For any lattice $\struct{L, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$, we have the identity mapping $\operatorname{id}_L$.
From Identity Mapping is Lattice Homomorphism we have $\operatorname{id}_L$ is a lattice homomorphism.
By Identity Mapping is Left Identity and Identity Mapping is Right Identity, this is the identity morphism for $\struct{L, \vee, \wedge, \preceq}$.

Finally by Composition of Mappings is Associative, the associative property is satisfied.

Hence $\mathbf{Lat}$ is a metacategory.
$\blacksquare$

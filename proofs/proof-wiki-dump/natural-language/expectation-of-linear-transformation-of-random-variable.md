Theorem
Let $X$ be a random variable. 
Let $a, b$ be real numbers. 
Let $\expect X$ denote the expectation of $X$. 

Then we have: 

$\expect {a X + b} = a \expect X + b$
if that expectation exists.


Proof
Discrete Random Variable
We have: 














\(\ds \expect {a X + b}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \sum_{x \mathop \in \Img X} \paren {a x + b} \map \Pr {X = x}\)





Expectation of Function of Discrete Random Variable














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \sum_{x \mathop \in \Img X} x \map \Pr {X = x} + b \sum_{x \mathop \in \Img X} \map \Pr {X = x}\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \expect X + b \times 1\)

\(=\)







\(\ds a \expect X + b\)









$\blacksquare$


Continuous Random Variable
Let $\map \supp X$ be the support of $X$. 
Let $f_XÂ : \map \supp X \to \R$ be the probability density function of $X$.

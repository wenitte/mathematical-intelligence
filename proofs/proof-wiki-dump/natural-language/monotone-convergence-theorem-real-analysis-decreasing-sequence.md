Theorem
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be a decreasing real sequence which is bounded below.

Then $\sequence {x_n}$ converges to its infimum.


Proof
Let $\sequence {x_n}$ be decreasing and bounded below.
Then $\sequence {-x_n}$ is increasing and bounded above.
Thus the Monotone Convergence Theorem for Increasing Sequence applies and the proof follows.

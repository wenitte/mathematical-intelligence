Lemma to Construction of Components of Major
In the words of Euclid:

Let $ABC$ be a right-angled triangle having the angle $A$ right, and let the perpendicular $AD$ be drawn;I say that the rectangle $CB, BD$ is equal to the square on $BA$, the rectangle $BC, CD$ equal to the square on $CA$, the rectangle $BD, DC$ equal to the square on $AD$, and, further, the rectangle $BC, AD$ equal to the rectangle $BA, AC$.
(The Elements: Book $\text{X}$: Proposition $33$ : Lemma)


Proof

Let $\triangle ABC$ be a right-angled triangle where $\angle A$ is right.
Let the perpendicular $AD$ be drawn.
From Proposition $8$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Perpendicular in Right-Angled Triangle makes two Similar Triangles:

triangles $\triangle ABC$, $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle ADC$ are all similar to each other.

From Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Equiangular Triangles are Similar:

$CB : BA = BA : BD$
Therefore from Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Rectangles Contained by Three Proportional Straight Lines:

the recangle contained by $CB$ and $BD$ equals the square on $AB$.
$\Box$

For the same reason:

the recangle contained by $BC$ and $CD$ equals the square on $AC$.
$\Box$

From Porism to Proposition $8$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Perpendicular in Right-Angled Triangle makes two Similar Triangles:

$BD : DA = AD : DC$
Therefore from Proposition $17$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Rectangles Contained by Three Proportional Straight Lines:

the recangle contained by $BD$ and $DC$ equals the square on $AD$.
$\Box$

From Proposition $4$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Equiangular Triangles are Similar:

$CB : CA = BA : AD$
From Proposition $16$ of Book $\text{VI} $: Rectangles Contained by Proportional Straight Lines:

the recangle contained by $BC$ and $AD$ equals the recangle contained by $BA$ and $AC$.
$\blacksquare$


Historical Note
This proof is Proposition $33$ of Book $\text{X}$ of Euclid's The Elements.

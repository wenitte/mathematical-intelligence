Lemma for Napoleon's Theorem
Let $T = \triangle ABC$ be an equilateral triangle in the Cartesian plane $\CC$.
Let the sides of $\triangle ABC$ be the vectors $\mathbf u$, $\mathbf v$, and $\mathbf w$.
Let the interior of $T$ lie to the left of the vector path.
Let $\mathbf v$ be rotated by an angle of $60 \degrees$ anticlockwise.
Let the rotated vector be $\mathbf v'$.
Then:

$\mathbf u + \mathbf v' = \mathbf 0$
where $\mathbf 0$ denotes the zero vector.





Proof
Let: $v = \norm {\mathbf v}$, $v' = \norm {\mathbf v'}$, and $u = \norm {\mathbf u}$.
By Vector Magnitude is Invariant Under Rotation:

$v = v'$
By definition of equilateral triangle:

$v = u$
By definition of equilateral triangle the angle between $\mathbf u$ and $\mathbf v$ is $120 \degrees$.
By definition of rotation the angle between $\mathbf u$ and $\mathbf v'$ is $180 \degrees$.
That is, the direction of $\mathbf v'$ is opposite to that of $\mathbf u$.
It follows that:














\(\ds \mathbf u\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\mathbf v'\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \mathbf u + \mathbf v'\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \mathbf 0\)

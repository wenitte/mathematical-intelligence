Examples of Use of Intersection of Sets of Integer Multiples
Let $m \Z$ denote the set of integer multiples of $m$.
Then:

$\paren {3 \Z \cap 6 \Z} \cup 18 \Z = 6 \Z$


Proof
From Intersection of Sets of Integer Multiples:

$3 \Z \cap 6 \Z = \lcm \set {3, 6} \Z = 6 \Z$
Then we have that:

$18 \Z \subseteq 6 \Z$
and so from Union with Superset is Superset:

$6 \Z \cup 18 \Z = 6 \Z$
Hence the result.
$\blacksquare$

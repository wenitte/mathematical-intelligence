Corollary to Equation of Circle
Let $C$ be a circle whose radius is $R$.
Let $C$ be aligned in a polar coordinate frame such that its center is at the origin.
Then the equation of a $C$ is given by:

$r = R$


Proof
From Equation of Circle: Polar Form, we have a circle whose center is at $\polar {r_0, \varphi}$ whose radius is $R$ is:

$r^2 - 2 r r_0 \, \map \cos {\theta - \varphi} + \paren {r_0}^2 = R^2$

So, when $\polar {r_0, \varphi} = \polar {0, 0}$:














\(\ds \sqrt {r^2 + 0^2 - 2 r \cdot 0 \cdot \map \cos {\theta - 0} }\)

\(=\)







\(\ds R\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \sqrt{r^2}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds R\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds r\)

Theorem
The multiplicity of $720$ in $720!$ is $178$.
That is:

$720^{178} \divides 720!$
but:

$720^{179} \nmid 720!$
where:

$720!$ denotes $720$ factorial
$\divides$ denotes divisibility
$\nmid$ denotes non-divisibility.


Proof
We have that:

$720 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5$
It remains to inspect the divisibility of $2$, $3$ and $5$ in $720!$
Thus:

Multiplicity of $2$ in $720!$
The prime factor $2$ appears in $720!$ to the power of $716$.
That is:

$2^{716} \divides 720!$
but:

$2^{717} \nmid 720!$


Multiplicity of $3$ in $720!$
The prime factor $3$ appears in $720!$ to the power of $356$.
That is:

$3^{356} \divides 720!$
but:

$3^{357} \nmid 720!$


Multiplicity of $5$ in $720!$
The prime factor $5$ appears in $720!$ to the power of $178$.
That is:

$5^{178} \divides 720!$
but:

$5^{179} \nmid 720!$

We calculate the multiplicity of the powers of $2$ and $3$ in $720!$ thus:














\(\ds 716\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 4 \times 179\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {2^4}^{179}\)

\(\divides\)







\(\ds 720!\)






















\(\ds 356\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 2 \times 178\)














\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \paren {3^2}^{178}\)

\(\divides\)







\(\ds 720!\)










Thus it is seen that the smallest power of the prime powers that are divisors of $720$ that divide $720!$ is that of $3^2$, which is $178$.
Hence:

$720^{178} \divides 720!$
but:

$720^{179} \nmid 720!$
$\blacksquare$

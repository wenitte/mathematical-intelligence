Theorem
The set of rational numbers $\Q$ forms a totally ordered field under addition and multiplication: $\struct {\Q, +, \times, \le}$.


Proof
Recall that by Integers form Ordered Integral Domain, $\struct {\Z, +, \times, \le}$ is an ordered integral domain
By Rational Numbers form Field, $\struct {\Q, +, \times}$ is a field.
In the formal definition of rational numbers, $\struct {\Q, +, \times}$ is the field of quotients of $\struct {\Z, +, \times, \le}$
By Total Ordering on Field of Quotients is Unique, it follows that $\struct {\Q, +, \times}$ has a unique total ordering on it that is compatible with its ring structure.

Thus $\struct {\Q, +, \times, \le}$ is a totally ordered field.

Examples of Formation of Ordinary Differential Equation by Elimination
Consider the equation:

$(1): \quad x^2 + y^2 = a^2$

This can be expressed as the ordinary differential equation:

$\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} = -\dfrac x y$
which demonstrates that the radius of a circle where it meets the circle is perpendicular to the tangent at that point.


Proof
Differentiating with respect to $x$:














\(\ds 2 x + 2 y \dfrac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds 0\)





Power Rule for Derivatives








\(\ds \leadsto \ \ \)





\(\ds \dfrac {\d y} {\d x}\)

\(=\)







\(\ds -\dfrac x y\)





rearranging



From Equation of Circle center Origin, $(1)$ is the equation of a circle whose center is at the origin.
The straight line $R$ from the origin to the point $\tuple {x, y}$ on the circle has slope $\dfrac y x$ by definition.
From Slope of Orthogonal Curves, a straight line $T$ through $\tuple {x, y}$ such that $\dfrac {\d y} {\d x} = -\dfrac x y$ is perpendicular to $R$.
But $T$ is by definition the tangent to the circle at $\tuple {x, y}$.
Hence we have shown that the radius of a circle where it meets the circle is perpendicular to the tangent at that point.
$\blacksquare$

Lemma
Every positive integer greater than $1$ has at least one divisor which is prime.


Proof
By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, every natural number greater than one can be factored into a unique set of prime numbers.
Therefore, every positive integer greater than one has at least one prime factor.

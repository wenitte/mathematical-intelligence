Theorem
The rational numbers $\Q$ form an ordered integral domain under addition and multiplication.


Proof
This follows directly from Rational Numbers form Totally Ordered Field:
The set of rational numbers $\Q$ forms an ordered field under addition and multiplication: $\struct {\Q, +, \times, \le}$.
An ordered field is also an ordered integral domain.

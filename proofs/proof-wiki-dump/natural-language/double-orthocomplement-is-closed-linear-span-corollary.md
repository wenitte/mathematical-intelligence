Corollary to Double Orthocomplement is Closed Linear Span
Let $H$ be a Hilbert space.
Let $A \subseteq H$ be a closed linear subspace of $H$.

Then:

$\paren {A^\perp}^\perp = A$


Proof
Since $A$ is a subspace of $H$, it is closed under linear combination, so: 

$\map \span A = A$
We therefore have:














\(\ds \vee A\)

\(=\)







\(\ds \paren {\map \span A}^-\)





Definition of Closed Linear Span














\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds A^-\)




















\(\ds \)

\(=\)







\(\ds A\)





since $A$ is closed, we have $A^- = A$ from Set is Closed iff Equals Topological Closure



while from Double Orthocomplement is Closed Linear Span, we have: 

$\paren {A^\perp}^\perp = \vee A$
So, we obtain: 

$\paren {A^\perp}^\perp = A$
$\blacksquare$

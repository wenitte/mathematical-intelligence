I'll convert this proof to FL-Math notation with explicit logical connections and formal structure:

```
theorem Recurring_Nines_Equals_One() {
  assert(
    0.999... = 1
  )
} ↔

proof Recurring_Nines_Equals_One() {
  // Initial variable definition
  setVar(c: ℝ) →
  assert(c = 0.999...) →
  
  // Multiply both sides by 10
  lemma Multiply_By_Ten() {
    assert(
      c = 0.999... →
      10c = 9.999...
    )
  } →
  apply(Multiply_By_Ten()) →
  
  // Subtraction step
  lemma Subtract_Equations() {
    assert(
      (10c = 9.999... ∧ c = 0.999...) →
      10c - c = 9.999... - 0.999...
    )
  } →
  apply(Subtract_Equations()) →
  
  // Simplify left side
  assert(10c - c = 9c) →
  
  // Simplify right side
  assert(9.999... - 0.999... = 9) →
  
  // Combined equation
  assert(9c = 9) →
  
  // Divide both sides by 9
  lemma Divide_By_Nine() {
    assert(
      9c = 9 →
      c = 1
    )
  } →
  apply(Divide_By_Nine()) →
  
  // Final substitution
  assert(c = 0.999... ∧ c = 1) →
  conclude(0.999... = 1)
}
```

This FL-Math version:
1. Clearly structures the proof with theorem and proof blocks
2. Uses explicit logical connectives (→, ∧) to show relationships between steps
3. Includes lemmas for major algebraic steps
4. Makes variable binding explicit with setVar
5. Maintains the mathematical rigor of the original proof
6. Shows the logical flow from each step to the next
7. Concludes with explicit conclusion statement

Each major algebraic manipulation is encapsulated in a lemma to show the logical structure more clearly, and all steps are connected with the appropriate logical connectives.

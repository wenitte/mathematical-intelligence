Sure, in natural language, the explanation would look like this:

The theorem being discussed here is called the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC1). This theorem tries to connect the concept of integration, represented by the integral symbol, with the concept of differentiation, represented by the 'd/dx' symbol.

The theorem states that: for any function 'f' that is continuous on an interval from a to b, if we define a new function F(x) as the integral of 'f' from some constant point C up to x, then the derivative of this new function F(x) is just the original function f(x) itself. Essentially, integration followed by differentiation takes you back to the original function.

This proof is accomplished through a series of logical implications which utilize the following mathematical concepts:

1. Derivative Definition (D): The derivative of the newly defined function F(x) equals the limit, as Δx approaches 0, of the ratio of the change in the value of F(x) and the change in x. In this case, change in the value of F(x) is the integral of 'f' from x to x+Δx, which gives an "average" sense of how 'f' varies over this small interval.

2. Mean Value Theorem (MVT): This theorem for integrals guarantees the existence of some point 'k' in the interval from x to x+Δx, such that f(k) times Δx equals the integral of 'f' from x to x+Δx.

3. Simplification (S): By substituting the consequence of the MVT into the derivative definition, we find that the derivative equals the limit, as Δx approaches 0, of f(k), where 'k' in fact approaches to x as Δx tends to 0.

4. Continuity Property (C): As function 'f' is continuous on the interval from a to b, the limit of f(k) as k approaches x just equals f(x). 

Finally, we reach the conclusion of the proof, which is the same as the statement of FTC1: the derivative of F(x), which was defined as the integral of 'f' from some constant C to x, is just the original function f(x). In simpler words, you get back your original function when you first integrate and then differentiate.

Therefore, this concludes the proof of the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

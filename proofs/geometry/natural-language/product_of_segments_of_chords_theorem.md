This proof uses geometry to demonstrate the properties of segments of chords in a circle. Here's what the proof is stating in step-by-step plain language:

We first define our scenario: imagine a circle with two chords AB and CD intersecting at point E. Draw two more segments AC and AD that will help establish our relationships.

Next, we establish the key angle relationships based on the properties of our constructed circle and chords. The inscribed angles CAB and CDB are congruent because they intercept the same arc, and the angles ACD and ABD are congruent for the same reason.

Now we can say that triangle DEA is similar to triangle CEB by AA (angle-angle) similarity, because they share the same pairs of congruent angles.

This similarity means that the ratio between corresponding sides of the triangles are equal, or in other words, the length of segment ED divided by segment EB equals the length of segment EA divided by segment EC. We can rearrange this proportion to show that the product of segments EA and EB equals the product of segments EC and ED. 

For example, imagine we have lengths given as follows: KN = x, NJ = x + 4, MN = x + 2, NL = x + 1. If you do the cross product between the pairs (KN and NJ and MN and NL), we find that the products are equal. This means x times (x+4) equals (x+2) times (x+1), which supports what we asserted in our initial theorem regarding the relationship between the segments.

Therefore, the proof statement holds true, as it has been successfully demonstrated that the product of two segments of chords in a circle from their point of intersection to the ends of the chord is consistent.

The theorem we're looking at here is the Isosceles Triangle Theorem, which states that if two sides of a triangle are equal in length, then the angles opposite these sides are also equal.

The proof for this goes as follows:

Consider any isosceles triangle, let's say ABC, where AB = AC - this is our given condition. In this triangle, let's draw a line from point A that is perpendicular to the base BC at point D - we refer to this line (AD) as the altitude from A to BC.

From the properties of altitudes in a triangle, we know that the angles made by this line with the base (i.e., ∠ADB and ∠ADC) are both 90°. Since the line AD bisects the base BC, it divides BC into two equal parts - BD and DC.

Next, consider the two triangles created by this bisector, ∆ADB and ∆ADC. We know AB = AC (from the given), BD = DC (from the bisector property), and AD is a common side in both triangles. Because of this, by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) congruence rule, we can say that these triangles are congruent to each other.

That means all their corresponding parts are equal, which is a property of congruent triangles (CPCT). Thus, ∠B = ∠C.

Hence, we have arrived at the conclusion, proving the Isosceles Triangle Theorem that if two sides of a triangle are equal, then their opposite angles are also equal.

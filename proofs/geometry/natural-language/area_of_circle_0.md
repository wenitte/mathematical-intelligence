This proof states that for any given value 'r', if 'r' is the radius of a circle, several implications follow.

First, the area of this circle, denoted as 'Area(r)', can be calculated by the definite integral of 2√(r²-x²) with respect to 'x' ranging from -r to r. Simultaneously, for any 'x' within the range of -r to r, 'y' equals either the positive or negative square root of (r²-x²).

The proof also includes a substitution: let 'x' be replaced with 'r*sin(θ)', where 'θ' is an angle that falls within the closed interval from -π/2 to π/2.

Following this substitution, 'dx', or the differential of 'x', becomes 'r*cos(θ)dθ'. Moreover, the area of the circle gets calculated as the definite integral from -π/2 to π/2 of 2r²√(1-sin²(θ))cos(θ) with respect to θ.

Next, it equivalently calculates the Area as the integral from -π/2 to π/2 of 2r²*cos²(θ), with respect to 'θ'.

Observe that for any value of 'θ', the equation 2cos²(θ) = 1 + cos(2θ) holds true. This identity allows us to simplify the equation of the area of the circle to 'r²' times the integral from -π/2 to π/2 of (1+cos(2θ)) with respect to 'θ'.

Applying the antiderivative and fundamental theorem of calculus leads to the result : Area(r) = r²[θ + (1/2)sin(2θ)] evaluated from -π/2 to π/2.

Finally, through simplification and evaluation of this expression, we conclude that the area of the circle is πr². This proves the formula for the area of a circle given its radius 'r'.

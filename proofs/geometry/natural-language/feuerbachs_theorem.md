Feuerbach's Theorem states that for any given triangle, the circle that passes through the midpoints of its sides, the feet of its altitudes, and the midpoints between its vertices and the orthocenter (also known as the nine-point circle) touches the incircle and all the circles tangent to the sides of the triangle (excluding the incircle, these are called excircles). 

The proof of this theorem starts by exploring two important points related to a triangle: the orthocenter (the point where the lines perpendicular to the sides through the vertices intersect) and the circumcenter (the center of the circle passing through all triangle vertices). The distance from these two points to the point where the incircle (the circle inside the triangle that touches all sides) touches one of the side extended (denoted as ‘r’) is defined to be equal to the length of one-fourth of the sum of the distances from the orthocenter to any point on the triangle and that point's reflection over the orthocenter.

The proof continues by determining the relative positions of some key points and lines associated with the triangle such as the perpendiculars from the circumcenter to the line joining a vertex and the orthocenter, midpoints of sides among others.

Then the proof introduces a relationship between the inradius (the radius of the incircle), the circumradius (the radius of the circumcircle), and the distance between the incenter (the center of incircle) and the nine-point center.

Following this, the theorem calculates the square of the distance between the incenter and the nine-point center using the previously defined and derived relations. This calculation simplifies to a result that equates this squared distance to a function of the inradius and circumradius, showing that the two quantities are dependent on each other.

Examining the condition for a circle to touch another, it is found that the distance between the incenter and the nine-point center equals half of the difference between the circumradius and inradius.

Finally, the theorem confirms that the nine-point circle touches not only the incircle but also any excircle of the triangle. This completes the proof of Feuerbach's Theorem.

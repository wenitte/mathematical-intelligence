This is a formal mathematical theorem stated in logical terms, but I will try to translate it into more everyday language.

The theorem starts by defining a so-called "geometry model" (M). This model is defined as a set of points and lines, which are not empty, along with what is known as an "incidence" relation, which pairs points with lines such that the set of points and lines are linked via this relation.

The theorem then states a couple of rules regarding this geometry model. First, it says that for any two distinct points in this model, there is exactly one line on which both points lie. Second, it states that for any given line in the model, there exist at least two distinct points that lie on that line.

Now, the theorem defines what's known as the "parallel postulate" in the model. It says that for every point and every line in the model that the point is not on, there exists exactly one line through the point that is parallel to the given line. This postulate also defines two lines to be parallel if they are different, and no point lies on both of them.

After setting up these definitions, the theorem moves on to define two specific models: the "euclidean model" and the "hyperbolic model". The euclidean model corresponds to our usual notion of geometry, characterized by the plane of real numbers and the standard concept of "line". In this model, the incidence is defined in the traditional way: a point lies on a line if and only if it's geometrically on that line.

On the other hand, the hyperbolic model is one where points are within the unit disc (the set of points in the plane whose distance to the origin is less than one), and "lines" are geodesics (shortest paths) in the Poincar√© disk model of hyperbolic geometry. Again, the point-line incidence is defined in a straightforward way: a point lies on a "line" if and only if it's geometrically on that geodesic.

Finally, the theorem claims the following: both the euclidean and hyperbolic models are indeed geometry models, and that the euclidean model satisfies the parallel postulate, while the hyperbolic model does not.

As a result of this, the parallel postulate is independent, meaning that it's possible to have a geometry model where the parallel postulate holds (like the euclidean model), and another where it doesn't (like the hyperbolic model).

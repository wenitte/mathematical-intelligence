This theorem defines the area of a triangle. It begins by assuming a triangle with sides denoted as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. A variable 's' is determined as half the sum of the sides of the triangle.

The area of the triangle is then computed using the formula √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). Here, 's' is the semi-perimeter of the triangle (half the sum of its sides), and 'a', 'b', 'c' are the lengths of the sides. This is essentially the Heron's formula for the area of a triangle.

The theorem then reconsiders the triangle, now also acknowledging the angles opposite to each side, denoted as 'α', 'β', and 'γ'. Furthermore, it defines the 'base' of the triangle as 'a' and the 'height' as the product of 'b' and sinγ.

Next, the theorem applies the law of cosines, a rule relating the lengths of the sides of any triangle to the cosine of one of its angles, in this case, 'γ'. After that, it uses a trigonometric identity to express sinγ in terms of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

Now, to derive the area of the triangle, the theorem begins by applying the standard formula A = ½(base)(height), substituting the base as 'a' and the height as 'b·sinγ'. As a result, the area of the triangle is A = ¼√(4a²b² - (a² + b² - c²)²).

After further algebraic manipulations, the area, 'A', is expressed as A = √((c-(a-b))(c+(a-b))((a+b)-c)((a+b)+c)/16).

Finally, the proof substitutes the variable 's', or the semi-perimeter of the triangle, back into the algebraic expression. The result is a simplified formula for the area of the triangle, given as: A = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This proves the theorem. The area of a triangle can indeed be computed using Heron's formula, given the lengths of its sides.

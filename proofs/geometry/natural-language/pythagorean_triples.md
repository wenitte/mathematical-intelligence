This proof is concerning Pythagorean triples, one of the fundamental elements in elementary number theory. The main purpose is to concretely define what constitutes a Pythagorean triple and to provide an explicit method for generating them.

First, we define a Pythagorean triple as three natural numbers a, b, and c that satisfy the equation a² + b² = c². What this means is that for any two squared numbers, if their sum equals another squared number, they form a Pythagorean triple. 

Moreover, these Pythagorean triples can be generated using two additional natural numbers m and n, such that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of m and n equals 1 (meaning m and n are coprime), and m is greater than n. Applying these conditions, we can directly calculate a, b, and c from the equations a = m² - n², b = 2mn, and c = m² + n². 

Now, a Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) is called primitive if the gcd of all three numbers equals 1 (i.e., the numbers are coprime to each other). Also, we establish a property that a Pythagorean triple can be scaled up by a factor k, such that it remains a Pythagorean triple after the scaling operation. 

For a given Pythagorean triple, we find the ratio (a + c) / b after it is reduced to its lowest terms. By defining this ratio as m/n, we ensure that m and n are coprime and m is greater than n. 

From this ratio, we can derive relationships between the Pythagorean triple components. We find that the quantity b times (m² - n²), equals a times twice the product of m and n, provided that m² - n² and 2mn are relatively prime. 

Ultimately, this leads us to examining two cases based on the parity (evenness or oddness) of m and n. 

In the first case, if m and n have opposite parity (one is even, the other is odd), then we can directly find the components of the Pythagorean triple using our existing equations: a = m² - n², b = 2mn, and c = m² + n². 

The second case arises when m and n are both odd. In such scenario, we calculate the values of a, b, and c by the derived formulas in this case which involve dividing some quantities by 2, hence the necessity for m and n to be both odd. It turns out that our derived equations are equivalent to the equations in the first case when rewritten using a new notation u and v, clearly showing the parametric equivalence in both cases. 

In conclusion, it is proven that for any natural numbers a, b, and c, they will form a Pythagorean triple if and only if there exist other natural numbers m and n, which are coprime and have asymmetrical parity (one even, one odd), with m being the larger. The value of a, b, and c can be directly computed from these m and n using the equations a = m² − n², b = 2mn, and c = m² + n².

This is a proof of Heron's formula, which gives the area of a triangle when the lengths of its three sides are known. It begins by setting up the formula for the area of a triangle, which is half the base times the height. 

It then proceeds by constructing a perpendicular from one vertex of the triangle to the opposite side, splitting the base of the triangle into two lengths 'x' and 'b-x'. The triangle is thus divided into two right-angled triangles, BDA and BDC.

For triangle BDA, the Pythagorean theorem is applied to solve for 'x', where 'x' is expressed as the square root of the difference between the square of side 'c' and the square of the height 'h'. 

Next, for triangle BDC, the Pythagorean theorem is again applied and after substituting the expression for 'x' obtained from triangle BDA, we get an equation in terms of side 'a'.

What follows is a series of algebraic manipulations, where the obtained equation is rearranged by isolating terms and squaring both sides, resulting in an equation for 'hÂ²'. This is then factored, simplifying into an expression involving the semiperimeter of the triangle (half the sum of the three sides).

Substituting the semiperimeter 's' (which is the same as half of 'P' where 'P' is the perimeter) into the expression for 'h', we get a formula for 'h' in terms of 's' and sides 'a', 'b' and 'c'. 

In the final steps, this equation for 'h' is substituted back into the area formula to get an expression for the area. When 'P' is expressed as 2's', this simplifies to the Heron's formula: the area of the triangle is the square root of the product of 's', (s-a), (s-b) and (s-c).

Hence, the theorem is proved.

Let's break this down into simpler language step by step:

1. The first set of statements makes some general claims about modular arithmetic: 
   - When we say "a is congruent to b mod n", it's the same as saying "n divides the difference between a and b".
   - If "a is congruent to b mod n", we can add or multiply the same number to both a and b and the congruence will still hold.
   - If "a is congruent to b mod n" and "c is congruent to d mod n", then "ac is congruent to bd mod n".
   - Lastly, if "a is congruent to b mod n" and k is a natural number, then "a raised to the power of k is congruent to b raised to the power of k mod n".

2. The next set of statements define notions related to numbers being coprime (i.e., having no common divisors other than 1):
   - Two numbers are coprime if and only if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1.
   - A number d is the gcd of a and b if and only if d divides a and b and for all numbers k that divide a and b, k also divides d.
   - If two numbers a and b are coprime, there exist numbers x and y such that a times x plus b times y equals 1.

3. Then we introduce Euler's totient function, represented as 'totient(m)', which is equal to the number of integers from 1 to m that are coprime with m.

4. Now, let's assume that m is greater than 1 and that a is coprime with m.

5. Let's set S to be the set of all numbers between 1 and m which are coprime with m. The size of this set is equal to the totient of m.

6. For all x in the set S, there is a unique y also in the set S such that the product of x and y is congruent to 1 modulo m.

7. Any time we multiply a member of S by a, the result is also in S.

8. Moreover, if we have two different members of S (say, x and y), and we multiply each by a, those results are also different under modulo m.

9. Now, let's create a new set, called T, formed by multiplying each element of S by a and then taking the result modulo m. The size of this new set is equal to the size of S.

10. The product of all elements in S and T are congruent modulo m.

11. The product of all elements in T is congruent to a raised to the size of S times the product of all elements in S, modulo m.

12. Since the size of S is the same as the totient of m, the product of all elements in S is congruent to a raised to the totient of m times the product of all elements in S, modulo m.

13. For the final conclusion, if we cancel out the product of all the elements in S from both sides (which we can do because they are coprime with m) it simplifies down to this: a raised to the totient of m is congruent to 1 modulo m. This is known as Euler's theorem.

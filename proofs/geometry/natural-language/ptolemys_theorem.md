This proof refers to the Ptolemy theorem for a circle.

What this theorem says, in simpler terms, is the following:

Consider any four points A, B, C, and D on a circle and also consider the distance between these points. Mathematically, these points can be defined using the Cartesian system with their position dependent on certain parameters. The definitions use the centre of the circle plus the radius multiplied a pair of functions of an angle (cosine and sine).

The points A, B, C, and D are not just any points, but they are arranged in a way that they form a cyclic quadrilateral. That is, they lie on the circumference of a circle and can form a four-sided polygon with the circle as its circumscribed circle. 

A, B, C, and D are arranged on the circumference such that the angles they subtend at the centre of the circle are in increasing order from 'a' to 'd'. Also, the radius of the circle is a non-negative number (more simply, it has a value of 0 or more).

The relation between these points according to Ptolemyâ€™s theorem is that the product of the lengths of the diagonals (AC and BD) is equal to the sum of the product of the lengths of pairs of opposite sides (AB and CD, and AD and BC).

This theorem, named after the Greek mathematician Ptolemy, gives a valuable relation that holds for a cyclic quadrilateral and is a fundamental element of geometry.

The Morley's theorem can be presented in natural language in the following way:

Consider a, b, and c as non-negative real numbers such that a, b and c add up to make pi over 3 (Ï€/3), which is equivalent to saying they collectively make up a right angle. 

Let's define A, B, C, P, Q, and T as points on a plane (expecting they are not the same; no two points coincide).

The angle represented by b is the angle between vectors BC and BP, between BP and BQ, and between BQ and BA.
Likewise, the angle represented by c is the angle between vectors CP and CB and between CT and CP.
The angle represented by a is the angle between vectors AB and AQ, between AQ and AT, and between AT and AC.

Then, the Morley's theorem suggests that with all these conditions in place, the triangle formed by points P, Q, and T is an equilateral triangle - a triangle where all sides are equal in length. Essentially, given a triangle with certain properties of its angles, we can predict another characteristic of the triangle.

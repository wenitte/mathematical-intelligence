This proof is a representation of the Pythagorean theorem. 

It states that for all real numbers 'a', 'b', and 'c' and for all points 'A', 'B', and 'C' in a two-dimensional plane, when you have a right triangle (indicated as TriangleΔ(A, B, C)) with 'C' located at the origin (0,0) of the coordinate system and 'A' located at (a, 0) and 'B' at (0, b); 

Then, the distance from point 'A' to point 'B' would be the square root of the sum of squares of 'a' and 'b', i.e., √(a²+b²), the distance from 'B' to 'C' would be 'b', and the distance from 'C' to 'A' would be 'a'. 

Finally, this implies that the square of the distance between points 'A' and 'B' is equivalent to the sum of squares of distances from 'B' to 'C' and 'C' to 'A'. This leads to the relation that the square of 'a' and 'b' is equal to the square of 'c', hence, confirming the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c², where 'c' is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

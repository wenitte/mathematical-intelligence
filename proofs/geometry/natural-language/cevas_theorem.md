This theorem, known as Ceva's Theorem, is conceptually saying that for any triangle ABC, and any points D, E, F that lie on the sides BC, CA, AB respectively, the three lines AD, BE, and CF will intersect at a single concurrence point if and only if a certain condition holds. The condition is that the ratio of the lengths AG to GC, multiplied by the ratio of BF to FA, and then multiplied by the ratio of CE to EB, must equal 1.

Now, for the proof:
Firstly, we define h₁ and h₂ as the heights (or altitudes) of two triangles, ABG and BGC, both of which are based on the larger triangle ABC.

Secondly, we establish a relationship between the areas of certain triangles in the figure, namely triangles ABG, BGC, ADG, and DGC. Each of these areas is represented as half the product of the base length and the corresponding altitude (height), following the formula for the area of a triangle (0.5 × base × height). This means, for example, that the area of triangle ABG is 0.5 times AG times h₁.

Next, we define some ratios by comparing the areas of specific triangles. These ratios are intended to illustrate the proportional relationships between different segments of the triangles. For instance, we find that the ratio AG/GC is equal to the ratio of the areas of triangles ABG and BGC, and is also equal to the ratio of the areas of triangles ADG and DGC.

Then, we express the three original ratios, AG/GC, BF/FA, and CE/EB, as a product of area ratios, after noting that they are equal to the corresponding area ratios.

Following these steps, we simplify the equation. After all the substitutions, we find that the product of the three ratios, AG/GC × BF/FA × CE/EB, is indeed 1.

We conclude the proof by stating that lines AD, BE, and CF are concurrent, signifying that they intersect in one point, if and only if the product of the ratios AG/GC, BF/FA, and CE/EB equals 1. Hence, the theorem is proved.

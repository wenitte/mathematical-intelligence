The theorem we are talking about is the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem for Triangles, which essentially states that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle on a flat plane is equivalent to pi radians, or 180 degrees.

This theorem makes use of what we call the Gauss-Bonnet formula. According to this formula, for any triangle "T" with vertices "v_i" and sides represented by "γ_i", the sum of three main components would equal 2π multiplied by the Euler characteristic of the triangle (notated as χ(T)). These components include the integral over the triangle of the Gaussian curvature "K", the sum of the integrals over the sides of the triangle of the geodesic curvatures "κ", and the sum of the external angles at the vertices, denoted "α_i".

Now let's bring in some specific conditions for a flat plane to simplify things. On a flat plane, the Gaussian curvature "K" is always zero, and for a triangle where the sides are geodesics, the geodesic curvatures "κ" are also zero. Additionally, if we simplify this to a contractible region - that is, a shape that can be deformed to a point without breaking or overlapping - the Euler characteristic becomes one.

Under all these conditions, the equation simplifies to the sum of the external angles "α_i" equaling 2π.

From here, we can define the internal angle at any vertex "v_i" as being pi minus the external angle at that vertex. The sum of all internal angles in the triangle would therefore be pi.

Thus, as both the sum of the external and internal angles have been calculated to be pi, the conclusion is that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is indeed pi, or equivalently 180 degrees. Therefore, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem is proved to be correct.

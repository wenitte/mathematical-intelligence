This theorem, known as the geometric partial sum theorem, states that the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula Sₙ = a(1 - rⁿ) / (1 - r), as long as the common ratio r is not 1.

The proof of this theorem begins by letting Sₙ represent the sum of the first n terms of the geometric sequence, which can be written as a, ar, ar², ..., arⁿ⁻², arⁿ⁻¹. 

We then reverse the order of the terms, which does not change their sum, so Sₙ is also equal to arⁿ⁻¹, arⁿ⁻², ..., ar², ar, a.

Next, we factor out a (the first term of the sequence), showing that the sum Sₙ is equivalent to a times the sum of the powers of the common ratio r (from 0 to n-1). 

After this, we use a known property of polynomials which states that the sum of terms in a geometric sequence (from r⁰ to rⁿ⁻¹) can be expressed as (rⁿ - 1) / (r - 1), again noting that this is valid only for r not equal to 1. 

Substituting this result into the equation for Sₙ, we arrive at the formula for Sₙ as a[(rⁿ - 1) / (r - 1)]. 

Finally, by simplifying the fraction, we get Sₙ = a(1 - rⁿ) / (1 - r), which is the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence, provided r is not equal to 1. 

So, the conclusion is that, given that r ≠ 1, Sₙ = a(1 - rⁿ) / (1 - r), we confirm or prove our initial theorem.

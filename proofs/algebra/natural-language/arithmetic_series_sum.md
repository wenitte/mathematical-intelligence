This proof explains how to calculate the sum (Sₙ) of an arithmetic series. An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two successive members is constant, with a common difference (d). 

For this proof, we start with the series where a₁ is the first term, and aₙ is the nth term, defined as a₁ + (n - 1)d. 

The sum of the series (Sₙ), then, is essentially adding the first term plus the second term (which is the first term plus d), plus the third term (which is the first term plus 2d), and so forth, up to the nth term which is a₁ + (n - 1)d.

The first step of the proof is re-writing Sₙ twice - once in its original order from the first to the last term, and once in reverse order, from the last to the first term.

Then, the second step is adding these two versions of Sₙ together which leads to the equation 2Sₙ = n(a₁ + aₙ). When you go ahead to solve for Sₙ, you get Sₙ = n/2 (a₁ + aₙ).

The third step is replacing aₙ, the nth term, with its formula a₁ + (n - 1)d in the equation we derived for Sₙ. Simplifying this gives us Sₙ = n/2 [2a₁ + (n - 1)d].

In conclusion, we have shown two ways to represent the sum of an arithmetic series: either as n/2 times the sum of the first and last term, Sₙ = n/2 (a₁ + aₙ), or as n/2 times two times the first term plus the common difference times (n - 1), Sₙ = n/2 [2a₁ + (n - 1)d].

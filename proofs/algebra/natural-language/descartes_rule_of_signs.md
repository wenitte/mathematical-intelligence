This explanation relates to Descartes' rule of signs that exist in mathematics, particularly in the field of polynomial functions. Specifically, I will translate these mathematical and logical definitions and proofs into more approachable natural language.

In simple terms, Descartes rule of signs determines the number of positive roots that a polynomial has. These are the possible solutions (or 'roots') where the value of the polynomial equals to zero. This number is equal to the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial (when the polynomial is ordered from highest to lowest degree), minus some multiple of two. For example, if a polynomial has 5 sign changes, it could have 5 positive roots, or 3, or 1.

Here, sign change is defined as any point where the coefficients of the polynomial (the 'c' values in front of the x^i terms) change from positive to negative or negative to positive.

A lemma (a proven statement used as a stepping-stone toward proving another statement) in this context relates to the parity (whether they're even or odd) of positive roots for a polynomial: if a polynomial's leading coefficient (the coefficient of its highest degree term) is positive, and the polynomial is positive when x approaches infinity and when x approaches zero from the right, then the number of the polynomial's strictly positive roots is even. But if instead the polynomial is negative as x approaches 0 from the right, then the number of the polynomial's strictly positive roots is odd.

The proof illustrated in this context demonstrates this concept: for a polynomial P with a positive leading coefficient, if P is positive as x approaches infinity and zero from the right, then P must cross the x-axis at even times. And if P is negative as x approaches infinity and zero from the right, then P must cross the x-axis odd times.

Finally, the proof of Descartes' rule of signs is presented: starting off with the guideline that the remainder when dividing the number of positive roots and number of sign changes by 2 is the same, it uses induction (a proof technique involving proving a base case then assuming the case for n to prove for n+1). This proof covers the base case when the polynomial is constant, meaning it has degree zero and hence no positive roots and no sign changes.

For the induction step, it assumes that the rule is true for a polynomial P of degree n and considers the derivative of P, called Q. It leverages Rolle's Theorem, a fundamental result in calculus stating if a function equals to zero at two distinct points, then there is at least one point between them where its derivative is zero. Using this, it then shows that unless P has two positive roots very close together, the number of positive roots of Q is close to that of P. This leads to the conclusion that the rule of signs holds for all polynomials: the number of positive roots equals the sign changes minus twice a non-negative integer.

The original theorem is a formal representation of the Euclidean division of polynomials, describing the relationship between a dividend (m), a divisor (d), the quotient (q), and the remainder (r) in polynomial division.

Essentially, this theorem is stating that for any two polynomials 'm' and 'd' belonging to the set of polynomials 'F[x]', there exists a unique triple (n, q, r), where 'n' is the degree of the polynomial, 'q' is the quotient and 'r' is the remainder, such that the following conditions hold:

1) The original polynomial 'm' can be obtained by multiplying the divisor 'd' by the quotient 'q' and then adding the remainder 'r'. In other words, we can represent any polynomial 'm' as a linear combination of 'd' and 'r'.
  
2) If the divisor is not zero, then the degree of the remainder (deg(r)) is less than the degree of the divisor (deg(d)).

The theorem component of the definition is essentially ensuring that the specification holds for all pairs of polynomials 'm' and 'd' under the euclidean division operation 'edivp'. That is, for every pair of polynomials, when we perform euclidean division of 'm' by 'd', the resulting quotient and remainder must confirm to the specifications mentioned.

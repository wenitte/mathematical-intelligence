The theorem in focus presents the Cubic Formula - a theoretical construction that enables the calculation of roots for any cubic equation. This can be understood as a series of step-by-step transformations and substitutions that result in a formula capable of identifying these roots.

The core assumption at the start is that every a, b, c, and d are constants in a cubic equation. This equation is originally expressed in the form of `x³ + ax² + bx + c = 0`. 

The first step in this process involves a change of variables, replacing 'x' with 'y - a/3'. This transfigures the initial equation into `y³ + (b - a²/3)y + (c - ab/3 + 2a³/27) = 0`. The transformation leads to a rejigging of coefficients but doesn't alter the identity of the roots.

This new equation is rewritten in the form `y³ + dy + e = 0`. When we say 'rewrite', it means that we've made a new cubic equation where 'd' is the result of 'b - a²/3' and 'e' is 'c - ab/3 + 2a³/27'. 

Another substitution then takes place, where 'y' is changed to `³√u - ³√v`. Substituting this into our recently formed equation results in `(³√u - ³√v)³ + d(³√u - ³√v) + e = 0`.

The properties of 'u' and 'v' are defined such that the product of 'u' and 'v' equals '-e/3' and the sum equals '-d/3'. 

This allows the actual calculation of 'u' and 'v' by solving the equations `u = (-e ± √(e² + 4d³/27))/2` and `v = (-e ∓ √(e² + 4d³/27))/2`. Notice, the only difference between the two is '±' and '∓', meaning while finding 'u' we consider both positive and negative values, but for 'v', we consider the opposite sign for the square root term as compared to the one used in finding 'u'.

This enables us to get 'y' by computing `³√u - ³√v`. Finally, we revert back to the variable 'x' by calculating `x = y - a/3` or equivalently, `x = (-b/3a ± ³√((…) ± √(…))) / 2`. 

In essence, the proof has transformed the complicated task of finding cubic roots into a series of manageable calculations, thanks to the power of substitution and transformation.

This proof sets out to demonstrate that morphism composition operation in a category is associative. In other words, it is aimed to prove that for three morphisms, f, g, and h, the order of their composition does not matter. This condition, morphism associativity, can be symbolically represented as (h ∘ g) ∘ f = h ∘ (g ∘ f), where ∘ denotes composition of morphisms. 

The proof follows several steps, relying upon definitions from category theory, a branch of mathematics dealing with abstract algebraic structures.

The first step references the definition of a category. In a category, it must be possible to compose morphisms, and every object in the category must have what is known as an 'identity morphism' - a kind of 'do-nothing' morphism that leaves any object it acts upon unchanged.

The second step that the proof acknowledges is the condition for the existence of composition, which is only when the codomain of the first morphism matches the domain of the next morphism. In our scenario, for h to be composed with (g ∘ f), g ∘ f must also exist which is true when the codomain of f is equal to the domain of g. Equivalently, if (h ∘ g) ∘ f exists, h ∘ (g ∘ f) must also exist. 

Finally, the proof steps into the demonstration of associativity itself. It considers 'x', an arbitrary member of the domain of 'f'. It then calculates the result of ((h ∘ g) ∘ f)(x) and (h ∘ (g ∘ f))(x). Since both these expressions yield the same result, it concludes based upon this, that (h ∘ g) ∘ f and h ∘ (g ∘ f) are in fact equal, confirming that morphism composition is associative.

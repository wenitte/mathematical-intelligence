Let's break down this proof and explain it in plain language:

1. We start by defining an inverse operation (I). An inverse operation in the context of category theory means that there exists a pair of morphisms (f and g) that link two objects (a and b) in such a way that the composition of g and f yields the identity operation on a (representing that you can "travel" from a to b via g and return to a via f), and similarly, the composition of f and g gives the identity operation on b. 

2. The second part of the proof establishes the uniqueness of the inverse (U). Suppose there's another morphism h from b to a that combined with f also gives the identity operation on both a and b. 

3. It's aimed to show that h is actually equal to g. This potentially includes several steps:
    - First, we consider the composition h with g. Since we know f ∘ g = id_b, we can replace g here with h ∘ (f ∘ g).
    - Then, rearranging the brackets gives us (h ∘ f) ∘ g. Since we know that h ∘ f = id_a, we can replace h ∘ f with id_a.
    - Thus, we obtain id_a ∘ g, which simplifies to just g as applying the identity operation doesn't change the object. 

4. Hence, we have shown that the morphism h, which was another potential inverse to f, must in fact be equal to g proving uniqueness. This indicates that there's only one valid morphism from b to a (which is g) that can serve as an inverse to f. 

So, the formal proof in natural language could be: "Consider two objects, a and b. If there exist morphisms between them (f from a to b, and g from b to a), that behave like an inverse pair (meaning that taking a to b via f and coming back via g, or vice versa, leaves you right where you started), then this inverse g is unique. If there were another morphism that could take you back to where you started, it would have to be identical to g."

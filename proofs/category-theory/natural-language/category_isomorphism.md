This proof is about some fundamental concepts of category theory, like isomorphisms, morphisms, identities and the equivalence property. Let's break it down piece by piece. 

The first part of the proof is defining isomorphisms. We are saying that a function 'f' from 'a' to 'b' is an isomorphism if there exists another function 'g', which is the reverse function from 'b' to 'a', such that applying 'g' after 'f' (g ∘ f) yields the identity on 'a', and applying 'f' after 'g' (f ∘ g) gives the identity on 'b'. 

Next, we are linking isomorphism to an equivalence relation. We have defined an equivalence relation between 'a' and 'b' to exist if there is an isomorphism between them. That's what the "a ≅ b" notation means.

The third part of the proof establishes the traditional properties of an equivalence relation: reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity. 

Reflexivity means every object is equivalent to itself, and we use the identity morphism to show this. 
Symmetry means if 'a' is equivalent to 'b', then 'b' is equivalent to 'a', and we use the inverse function to show this. 
Transitivity means if 'a' is equivalent to 'b' and 'b' is equivalent to 'c', then 'a' is equivalent to 'c'. We demonstrate this using function composition.

Finally, we use these properties to prove something about the behavior of isomorphisms under composition. The last part of the proof says that if you have two isomorphisms 'f' and 'g', from 'a' to 'b' and from 'b' to 'c' respectively, then their composite (g ∘ f) is also an isomorphism, and its inverse is the composition of the inverses of 'f' and 'g', in reverse order.

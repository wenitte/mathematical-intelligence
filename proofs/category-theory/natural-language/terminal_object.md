Let's interpret this proof in a conversational manner. This proof deals with three definitions or concepts in category theory: terminal object, uniqueness of terminal object, and the concept of a singleton set as a terminal object.

To start, a 'terminal object' is an object in a category C, that we are calling 't', which has one unique morphism from every other object in the category. To say it in other terms: for any object 'x' in C, there's exactly one arrow or morphism from 'x' to 't' (that's what the equation |Mor(x,t)| = 1 means).

Our next statement is about the unique nature of this terminal object. If we have two objects 't1' and 't2' in the category C that both behave like terminal objects (meaning there is exactly one morphism from every object 'x' to both 't1' and 't2'), then 't1' and 't2' should essentially be considered the same. We can prove this by showing that there exist morphisms 'f' from 't1' to 't2' and 'g' from 't2' to 't1', which, when composed in both orders, act as identity morphisms. In plain terms, going from 't1' to 't1' via 't2' (using 'f' and 'g') is same as staying at 't1' and similarly for 't2'.

Finally, we use the above two statements or theorems to prove something about the category of sets, specifically about the set that contains only one element (known as a 'singleton' set). We argue that this one-element set, denoted as '{*}', is the terminal object in the category of sets. This is because for any set 'x', there is only one function that can map 'x' to this one-element set (represented by |Mor(x,{*})| = 1).

This means that the singleton set has the honored title of 'terminal object' in the realm of sets. And thanks to our previous discussion of terminal objects, we know that it is unique in this role (up to isomorphism).

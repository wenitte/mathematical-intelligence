This formal proof describes a property of a mathematical structure called a "pullback" in the context of category theory. Category theory deals with abstract structures, their properties, and relationships, and a "pullback" is one such structure. Let's translate this proof into a natural language explanation.

The proof begins by setting the stage for a candidate pullback structure 'P'. In this structure, there are two morphisms (which in category theory can represent functions or more general transformations): 'f', which goes from 'b' to 'd', and 'g', which goes from 'c' to 'd'.  Additionally, there are morphisms 'p₁' and 'p₂', both of which originate from a common object 'a', with 'p₁' mapping to 'b' and 'p₂' mapping to 'c'. The key property of a pullback is that the composition of 'f' and 'p₁' equals the composition of 'g' and 'p₂'. 

The proof then introduces the concept of a "universal property", denoted 'U'. This property states that for every object 'x' in the category 'C', and for each pair of morphisms 'h₁' from 'x' to 'b' and 'h₂' from 'x' to 'c', if 'f' composed with 'h₁' equals 'g' composed with 'h₂', then there exists a unique morphism 'u' from 'x' to 'a' such that 'p₁' composed with 'u' equals 'h₁', and 'p₂' composed with 'u' equals 'h₂'. This is a very strong property, as it effectively 'completes' the pullback by supplying a unique morphism 'u' from any potential input object 'x'.

Finally, the proof concludes with a demonstration of uniqueness denoted as 'Q', stating that if there exists a morphism 'v' from 'x' to 'a' such that 'p₁' with 'v' equals 'h₁' and 'p₂' with 'v' equals 'h₂', then 'v' must equal 'u'. This further strengthens the universality of 'u', as it asserts that no other morphism like 'v' can satisfy the same properties unless it is 'u' itself. In a way, 'u' is the only morphism that can thread the needle given the restrictions placed by the pullback and the compositions involving 'f' and 'g'.

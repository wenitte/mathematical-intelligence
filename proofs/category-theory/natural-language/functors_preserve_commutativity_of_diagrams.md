This proof is about the preservation properties of a functor in category theory. 

The idea of a functor is that it provides a way to map between two categories. Here, F is presented as a functor that maps from category C to category D. 

A critical concept employed in the proof is the 'commutative diagram', represented here by 'Square(S)'. A commutative diagram is a visual representation of a collection of objects (in this case denoted as a, b, c, and d) and morphisms (f, g, h, and i), with the property that all direct paths from one object to another yield the same result. In this case, the diagram "commutes" if and when the composition of morphisms g and f is equal to the composition of morphisms i and h (g ∘ f = i ∘ h). 

The next part of the proof introduces the application of the functor F to the commutativity condition and the morphisms in 'Square(S)': the functor F applied to the morphisms results in new morphisms in the target category D, and the commutativity condition is preserved, producing the 'Square(F(S))'.

The last part of the proof, 'preservation_proof(R)', shows that the functor preserves the commutativity of the diagram. If the original diagram 'S' commutes (i.e., g ∘ f = i ∘ h), then after applying the functor F, the resulting diagram 'F(S)' also commutes, and the equality F(g ∘ f) = F(i ∘ h) holds. This is further broken down to F(g) ∘ F(f) = F(i) ∘ F(h), demonstrating that the square 'F(S)' indeed preserves the commutativity.

In summary, the proof is showing that if the square diagram in our first category commutes, the corresponding diagram in the target category, given by applying the functor to each of the objects and morphisms, will also commute. This is an essential property of functors in category theory.

This proof is about specific structures in a category, called coproducts, which have an associated unique property, and its objective is to prove the uniqueness of these coproducts.

Before we get into the details of the proof, let's explain the used symbols: 'Ob(C)' denotes the objects of a category C, 'Mor(a,b)' represents morphisms from object 'a' to 'b' and 'id_s' is the identity morphism for object 's'. The ⊕ symbol denotes coproduct, and '≅' states that two objects are isomorphic, meaning that there is a pairwise morphism between them that respects their properties.

First, the coproduct definition is set up in a category C. It introduces objects a, b, and s, along with morphisms i₁ and i₂ from a and b into s respectively. This intuitively defines s as the 'sum' object of a and b.

Next, the universal property characterizes such s. For any object x in C, and for any pair of morphisms f from a to x and g from b to x, there is a unique morphism h from s to x (denoting the sum to x) which respects the original morphisms, meaning h after i₁ equals f, and h after i₂ equals g.

This universal property is a defining feature of coproducts and states that any object in C that has similar morphisms to our coproducts will have a unique morphism from the coproduct maintaining the structure.

Finally, the uniqueness of the coproduct is proven. For another potential coproduct t with respective morphisms to a and b (i₁ᵗ and i₂ᵗ), there exist unique morphisms f and g, from s to t and vice versa. These morphisms respect the identities of s and t, meaning g after f is the identity for s, and f after g is the identity for t.

This condition paves the way to state that s and t are isomorphic, represented by s ≅ t, proving our claim of uniqueness for the coproduct in category C, because any other object that behaves like our coproduct is essentially identical (isomorphic) to it.

The proof defined here relates to the concept of categorical pushouts, universal properties and object isomorphism in the branch of mathematics known as category theory. Let's break it down:

The first paragraph defines a pushout. A pushout in category theory, denoted by 'P', is an object along with two morphisms, in this case 'i₁' and 'i₂', stemming from objects 'b' and 'c' merged at 'p' in a category 'C'. These two morphisms 'i₁' and 'i₂' interact in a specific way with two other morphisms, 'f' that maps 'a' to 'b', and 'g' that maps 'a' to 'c'. Their specific interaction is dictated by the condition 'i₁ ∘ f = i₂ ∘ g', which means the composition of 'i₁' and 'f' is the same as composition of 'i₂' and 'g'.

The second paragraph defines a universal property, denoted by 'U'. It describes how for any object 'x' in the category with morphisms 'h₁' from 'b' to 'x', and 'h₂' from 'c' to 'x' that satisfy the same condition as before, i.e., 'h₁ ∘ f = h₂ ∘ g', there exists a unique morphism 'u' from 'p' to 'x' that makes the diagram commute, which means 'u ∘ i₁ = h₁' and 'u ∘ i₂ = h₂'. This implies that regardless of your chosen object 'x', you can find a unique morphism 'u' which maintains this property, therefore 'P' has the universal property.

The third paragraph is a uniqueness proof, denoted by 'Q'. That is, if there exists objects 'p' and 'q' in category 'C' and morphisms 'i₁ᵖ' and 'i₂ᵖ' from 'b' and 'c' to 'p', and 'i₁ᵍ' and 'i₂ᵍ' from 'b' and 'c' to 'q' respectively, as well as unique morphisms 'v' from 'p' to 'q' and 'w' from 'q' to 'p' that satisfy the conditions 'w ∘ v = id_p' and 'v ∘ w = id_q' (where 'id_p' and 'id_q' are identity morphisms on 'p' and 'q' respectively), then it implies that 'p' and 'q' are isomorphic, or in other words, indistinguishable in the categorical context.

In essence, the formal proof expresses the idea that a pushout with a universal property is unique up to isomorphism in the category.

The mathematical proof you posted is explaining the concept of a coequalizer in the context of category theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with abstract structure and concepts. 

Let's break this down into everyday language:

The proof starts with the definition of a coequalizer. In a given category C, if you have two morphisms (functions, or more generally, arrows) denoted 'f' and 'g' going from object 'a' to object 'b', and another object 'q' and morphism 'p' from 'b' to 'q' such that 'p' followed by 'f' equals 'p' followed by 'g' (i.e., p ∘ f = p ∘ g), then 'q' and 'p' satisfy the coequalizer condition for 'f' and 'g'.

The proof then introduces a universal property. This says that for any object 'x' in the category and any morphism 'h' from 'b' to 'x' which makes the same relationship as before (i.e., h ∘ f = h ∘ g), there exists a unique morphism 'u' from 'q' to 'x' such that following 'p' by 'u' gives 'h' (i.e., u ∘ p = h). This condition identifies 'q' and 'p' as the coequalizer of 'f' and 'g' not only within the category 'C', but universally (for all categories with the required structure). 

Finally, the proof asserts the uniqueness of the coequalizer. Here, if you have two potential coequalizers 'q₁' and 'q₂' with associated morphisms 'p₁' and 'p₂', and they satisfy the dual property (i.e., there exist unique morphisms 'v' and 'w' such that 'w' followed by 'v' equals the identity on 'q₁' and 'v' followed by 'w' equals the identity on 'q₂'), then 'q₁' and 'q₂' are actually the same (i.e., 'q₁' is isomorphic to 'q₂').

In sum, the proof is saying that for two given morphisms 'f' and 'g', there is such a thing as a coequalizer in category 'C', which satisfies certain properties. Furthermore, that coequalizer is unique up to isomorphism.

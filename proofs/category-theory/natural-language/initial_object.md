First the proof provides an initial definition (I). It says that an object "i" is a part of the object set "Ob(C)". And for every object "x" in the set "Ob(C)", there exists exactly one morphism from "i" to "x". In simpler terms, this means from a given point "i", there's exactly one way to get to any other point "x" within set "C". 

The proof then demonstrates uniqueness (U). It takes two objects: "i₁" and "i₂" from the set "Ob(C)", and shows that for every object "x", there is exactly one morphism from "i₁" to "x", as well as from "i₂" to "x". 
If there are morphisms "f" from "i₁" to "i₂" and "g" from "i₂" to "i₁", these morphisms can be composed in two different ways: "g" after "f" and "f" after "g". Both compositions result in an identity morphism on "i₁" and "i₂" respectively. This means that "i₁" and "i₂" are isomorphic, that is, they have the same structure, despite possibly being different objects. 

Finally, it proves the case of an empty initial object (E). It proposes that the empty set is an object in the category of sets (Ob(Set)). For every object "x" in this category, there is a unique morphism from the empty set to "x". This morphism is denoted as "f_∅". Even in the case of an empty object, the proof demonstrates that there exists a single and unique way to get to any object "x". 

This way, the proof shows that in all three cases - initial definition (I), uniqueness (U), and empty initial object (E)- there always exists exactly one morphism from a given object to any other object in the set, regardless of the specifics of the objects themselves, emphasizing the uniformity and consistency of the system under consideration.

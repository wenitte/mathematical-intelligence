In simple terms, this proof explains a mathematical concept called "functor composition" in the context of category theory. Category theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with abstract structures and the relationships between them.

The proof starts with the assumption that F is a functor (basically a special type of mathematical function) that maps from category C to category D (written as F: C → D).

Next, it states that for any object x in category C, applying functor F to the identity of x (noted as id_x, an operation that just returns x itself) gives us the identity of F(x).

The proof then refers to general category axioms. These are the fundamental rules of category theory and underlying assumptions that all categories must satisfy. For every object 'c' in category 'C', there exists an identity relation 'id_c' that means going from 'c' to 'c'. If you take any operation 'f' that takes 'a' to 'b', if you apply the operation and then apply the identity relation of 'b', you get back 'f'. And similarly, if you apply the identity of 'a' first and then apply the operation 'f', you still get 'f'.

After the category axioms, the proof describes the properties of a functor. One of the main properties of a functor is that it maintains the structure of the operations in a category, mathematically this is represented as F(g ∘ f) = F(g) ∘ F(f). This simply means that applying functor F to the composition of two operations (g ∘ f) is the same as the composition of the results of applying F to each operation individually. Also, the functor maps the morphisms (operations or arrows) in category C to those in category D.

The final part of the proof relates to the preservation of identity by a functor. For a given object x in category C, even when you apply the functor F to the composition of identity of x with itself, it still results in F applied to identity of x. This is because of the nature of identity (per category axiom) where applying identity to anything just returns the same thing. The proof also states that F(id_x) is an endomorphism on F(x) - which basically means it maps F(x) to itself. Thus, it concludes that F(id_x) equals the identity of F(x). In other words, functors preserve identity.

The proof is about four different concepts in category theory: monomorphisms, left cancelation, composition of monos, and isomorphisms that are monos. 

1. Monomorphism (or Mono) Definition: An arrow m in the category C from object b to object c (notated as m ∈ Mor(b,c)) is a monomorphism if and only if, for all objects x in C and for all arrows f and g from x to b (in the set of morphisms Mor(x,b)), the composition of m after f and m after g being the same (m ∘ f = m ∘ g), implies that f and g are the same (f = g).

2. Left Cancellation: A category C has the property of left cancellation if for any given morphism m from b to c, if m is mono (a special type of morphism with certain properties), then for all morphisms f and g from x to b, if m composed with f equals m composed with g (m ∘ f = m ∘ g), then f = g. Basically, you can cancel m from both sides of the equation to get f = g.

3. Composition of Monos: In case we have two morphisms - m₁ from a to b and m₂ from b to c, and both m₁ and m₂ are monos, then their composition (m₂ ∘ m₁) will also be a monomorphism.

4. Isomorphisms that are Mono: An isomorphism f from a to b in the category (notated as f ∈ Mor(a,b)) has the property that if f is an isomorphism, then f is a mono. This is demonstrated by the fact that the inverse of f composed with f (f⁻¹ ∘ f) cancels itself out. The inverse of f exists because f is an isomorphism. And so, if f composed with any morphisms g₁ and g₂ are equal (f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂), by replacing f with f⁻¹ ∘ f, g₁ will be equal to g₂ (g₁ = g₂).

Essentially, these are statements about different types of mappings or functions in the context of category theory. They capture important properties of these functions, which can be useful in a variety of mathematical settings, particularly in understanding certain abstraction in mathematics.

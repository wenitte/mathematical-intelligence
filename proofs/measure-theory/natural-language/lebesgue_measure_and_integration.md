Let's break down this intricate mathematical proof into simpler language.

The proof starts with the Lebesgue integration definition (Lebesgue_Integration). The Lebesgue integral of a function, according to this definition, is the supremum (the least upper bound) of a set of values. These values come from a function that maps elements from the set E to the set of extended real numbers (‚ÑùÃÑ). The integral, denoted as LInt_p(f), is defined as the supremum of values z that are members of the extended real numbers. There exists a function g, mapping elements from E to the set of real numbers, that satisfies several conditions: 
(i) g is a simple function (defined by SF(gen,g));
(ii) g is non-negative (defined by non_neg(g));
(iii) g(x) is always less than or equal to f(x) for all x; 
(iv) the Lebesgue integral of g (with respect to measure Œº) equals z.

The proof then continues with the Bochner integration definition (BInt). The Bochner integral of a function f that maps elements from the set X to E is denoted as BInt(bf). It is defined as the limit (as n approaches infinity) of the Bochner integral of the sequence of simple approximations to function bf (denoted as BInt_sf(Œº,seq(bf,n))).

Lastly, the proof defines the Lebesgue measure. The measure of the Carath√©odory generated œÉ-algebra (ùíû_L), denoted as measure(ùíû_L), is created by a function (mk_measure). This function takes several parameters: 
(i) the œÉ-algebra ùíû_L;
(ii) a function Œª*;
(iii) a function that always returns false, denoted as Œª*_False;
(iv) a function that verifies if a given value is greater than or equal to 0, denoted as Œª*_ge_0;
(v) the Lebesgue œÉ-additivity property.

In simplistic terms, this proof is expressing how the definitions for Lebesgue Integration, Bochner Integration, and Lebesgue Measure are interconnected. The Lebesgue integral pits a function against all simpler, non-negative functions that don't exceed it, looking for the supremum among them. The Bochner integral simplifies a function into a sequence of easier-to-handle pieces. The Lebesgue measure creates a way to measure the size of all subsets within a certain œÉ-algebra. The links between these form a fundamental part of measure theory and integration theory.

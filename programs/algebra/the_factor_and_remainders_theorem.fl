I'll convert this into a FuturLang program, carefully analyzing the logical relationships between statements.

// euclidean_division_polynomials.fl

// Universe level declarations required for type definitions
level u → 

// Basic type definitions needed for polynomials
struct Field@{u} {
  carrier: Set@{u}
} → 

struct Polynomial@{u} {
  field: Field@{u};
  coefficients: List[field.carrier]
} → 

// Core definitions needed for the theorem
definition deg(p: Polynomial): ℕ {
  return max({ i | p.coefficients[i] ≠ 0 })
} → 

// Specification of Euclidean division for polynomials
definition edivp_spec(m: Polynomial, d: Polynomial): Set[(Polynomial, Polynomial)] {
  return {
    (q,r): (Polynomial, Polynomial) |
      m = q*d + r ∧
      (d ≠ 0 → deg(r) < deg(d))
  }
} → 

// Implementation of polynomial division algorithm
definition edivp(m: Polynomial, d: Polynomial): (Polynomial, Polynomial) {
  // Implementation details omitted for brevity
  return (quotient, remainder)
} → 

// Main theorem statement
theorem Euclidean_Division_Polynomials() {
  assert(
    ∀(m: Polynomial, d: Polynomial) ⇒
      edivp_spec(m, d, edivp(m, d))
  )
} ↔ // Equivalent to its proof

// Proof of the theorem
proof Euclidean_Division_Polynomials() {
  setVar(m: Polynomial) →
  setVar(d: Polynomial) →
  
  // Get division result
  setVar((q,r): (Polynomial, Polynomial), edivp(m,d)) →
  
  assert(
    m = q*d + r ∧  // Division equation holds
    (d ≠ 0 → deg(r) < deg(d))  // Degree condition satisfied
  ) →
  
  // Final verification that result satisfies specification
  assert(edivp_spec(m, d, (q,r)))
}

Key logical connection analysis:
1. Universe level and type definitions use → as they enable subsequent definitions
2. Core definitions (deg, edivp_spec, edivp) use → as each builds on previous ones
3. Main theorem and its proof are connected by ↔ as they are logically equivalent
4. Within the proof, steps are connected by → showing logical progression
5. The assertion combining division equation and degree condition uses ∧ as both must hold simultaneously

The structure maintains the exact logical dependencies of the original proof while expressing it in FuturLang's formal syntax.

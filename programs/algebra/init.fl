I don't see a proof provided to convert to FuturLang. Please share the mathematical proof you'd like me to convert, and I will:

1. Analyze the logical dependencies between statements
2. Choose appropriate connectives (→, ∧, ↔) based on the relationships
3. Preserve variable bindings and type annotations
4. Maintain mathematical symbols
5. Structure it as a valid .fl program

The example you provided shows:
- How to use universe levels and type definitions
- Proper structuring of definitions, lemmas, and proofs
- Correct use of logical connectives
- Mathematical symbol preservation
- Variable binding and type annotation

Please share the proof you want converted and I'll apply these principles to create a proper FuturLang program.

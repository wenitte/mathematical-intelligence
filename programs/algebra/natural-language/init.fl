I notice that you haven't provided a specific mathematical proof for me to convert into FuturLang. To convert a mathematical proof into a FuturLang program, I would need:

1. The mathematical proof itself, including:
   - Any preliminary definitions
   - The theorem statement
   - The proof steps and reasoning
   - Any lemmas or supporting propositions

2. Then I would:
   - Analyze the logical dependencies between statements
   - Choose appropriate connectives (→, ∧, ↔)
   - Structure the program following FuturLang conventions
   - Preserve mathematical symbols and type annotations
   - Output with .fl extension

Please provide the mathematical proof you'd like me to convert, and I'll help transform it into a proper FuturLang program while carefully maintaining the logical relationships between statements.

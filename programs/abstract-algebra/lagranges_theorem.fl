I'll convert this into a FuturLang program, carefully analyzing the logical relationships between statements.

// lagrange.fl

// Universe levels for type definitions
level u → 

// Type definitions
struct Group@{u} {
  carrier: Set@{u};
  operation: carrier → carrier → carrier;
  identity: carrier;
  inverse: carrier → carrier
} →

struct Subgroup@{u} {
  parent: Group@{u};
  elements: Set@{u}
} →

// Main theorem definition
theorem Lagrange_Theorem() {
  assert(
    ∀(G: Group) ⇒
      ∀(H: Subgroup(G)) ⇒
        (
          |G| = |H| · [G:H] →
          |H| divides |G|
        )
  )
} ↔ // Equivalent to its proof

proof Lagrange_Theorem() {
  // Initial assumptions
  setVar(G: Group, finite) →
  setVar(H: Subgroup(G)) →
  setVar(n: ℕ, |G|) →
  setVar(m: ℕ, |H|) →
  setVar(r: ℕ, [G:H]) →

  // Cosets definition - foundational for next steps
  assert(
    ∀(x: G.carrier) ⇒
      ∃!(xH: Set) ⇒
        (x ∈ xH)
  ) → // Enables disjoint cosets property

  // Disjoint cosets property
  assert(
    ∀(x₁ x₂: G.carrier) ⇒
      (x₁H = x₂H → x₁ = x₂)
  ) ∧ // Works together with union property

  // Union of cosets
  assert(
    ∪{xH | x ∈ G.carrier} = G.carrier
  ) → // Enables partition property

  // Partition property
  assert(
    ∀(x: G.carrier) ⇒
      (
        ∃!(xH: Set) ∧
        DisjointCosets(G, H)
      )
  ) → // Leads to counting argument

  // Number of cosets
  assert(
    (
      r = [G:H] ∧
      |H| = m
    )
  ) → // Enables size calculation

  // Elements in partition
  assert(|G| = r · |H|) → // Leads to divisibility

  // Divisibility conclusion
  assert(
    ∃(k: ℕ) ⇒
      (|G| = |H| · k)
  ) → // Final step

  // Conclusion
  assert(|H| divides |G|)
}

I've structured the program with the following logical relationships:

1. Universe level and type definitions use → as they enable subsequent definitions
2. The main theorem and its proof are linked with ↔ as they are logically equivalent
3. Within the proof:
   - Initial variable declarations use → as they enable subsequent steps
   - Cosets definition → disjoint cosets as it enables that property
   - Disjoint cosets ∧ union property work together
   - Partition property → number of cosets → elements calculation → divisibility
   - Each step in the main proof chain uses → to show logical progression
4. Each assertion builds on previous ones in a clear chain of implications

The program maintains all mathematical symbols and proper variable bindings while expressing the logical structure of Lagrange's theorem and its proof.

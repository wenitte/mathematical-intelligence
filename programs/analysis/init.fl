I don't see a proof provided to convert to FuturLang. Please share the mathematical proof you'd like me to convert, and I'll help analyze the logical relationships between statements and create a properly structured FuturLang program with appropriate connectives.

When you share the proof, I'll:
1. Break it down into atomic statements
2. Analyze the logical dependencies between statements
3. Choose appropriate connectives (→, ∧, ↔)
4. Structure it following FuturLang conventions
5. Preserve all mathematical symbols and type annotations
6. Include proper variable bindings

Please provide the mathematical proof you'd like to convert.

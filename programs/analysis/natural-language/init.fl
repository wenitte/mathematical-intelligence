You're right - I don't see the mathematical proof that needs to be converted to FuturLang. Could you please provide the mathematical proof that needs to be translated? Once you share it, I can help:

1. Break it down into logical components
2. Analyze the dependencies between statements
3. Choose appropriate logical connectives (→, ∧, ↔) 
4. Structure it following FuturLang conventions with proper:
   - Type definitions
   - Variable bindings
   - Unicode mathematical symbols
   - Logical dependencies
   - Lemmas and proofs

Please share the mathematical proof you'd like me to convert and I'll help translate it into a proper FuturLang program.

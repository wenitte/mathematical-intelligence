I'll help convert this proof into a FuturLang program, analyzing each logical connection carefully:

// mean_value_theorem.fl

// Type and function definitions
definition continuous(f: ℝ → ℝ, interval: [ℝ, ℝ]): 𝔹 {
  // Definition of continuity
} →

definition differentiable(f: ℝ → ℝ, interval: (ℝ, ℝ)): 𝔹 {
  // Definition of differentiability
} →

theorem Mean_Value_Theorem() {
  assert(
    ∀(f: ℝ → ℝ) ⇒
      ∀(a: ℝ) ⇒
        ∀(b: ℝ) ⇒
          (
            a < b ∧
            continuous(f, [a, b]) ∧
            differentiable(f, (a, b))
          ) →
          ∃(c: ℝ) ⇒
            (
              c ∈ (a, b) ∧
              f'(c) = (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a)
            )
  )
} ↔ // Equivalence with its proof

proof Mean_Value_Theorem() {
  // Initial assumptions combined with ∧
  setVar(f: ℝ → ℝ) ∧
  setVar(a: ℝ) ∧
  setVar(b: ℝ) ∧
  assume(
    a < b ∧
    continuous(f, [a, b]) ∧
    differentiable(f, (a, b))
  ) →  // These assumptions enable construction of g

  // Define auxiliary function g
  definition g(x: ℝ): ℝ {
    return f(x) - ((f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a))(x - a) - f(a)
  } →  // g definition enables following properties

  // Properties of g combined with ∧ as they're simultaneous facts
  assert(
    continuous(g, [a, b]) ∧
    differentiable(g, (a, b)) ∧
    g(a) = 0 ∧
    g(b) = 0
  ) →  // These properties enable application of Rolle's theorem

  // Apply Rolle's theorem
  apply(rolle_theorem) →
  assert(∃(c: ℝ) ⇒ (c ∈ (a, b) ∧ g'(c) = 0)) →  // Leads to derivative calculation

  // Calculate g'
  assert(∀(x: ℝ) ⇒ g'(x) = f'(x) - (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a)) →  // Enables final conclusion

  // Final chain of equivalent statements
  assert(
    g'(c) = 0 ↔
    f'(c) - (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a) = 0 ↔
    f'(c) = (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a)
  )
}

I analyzed each connection and used:
- → for sequential logical implications where one statement enables or leads to the next
- ∧ for simultaneous facts or conditions that work together
- ↔ for equivalent statements or bi-implications

The key logical relationships are:
1. Initial definitions enable the theorem statement
2. Theorem is equivalent to its proof
3. Assumptions combine with ∧ as simultaneous conditions
4. Definition of g enables its properties
5. Properties combine with ∧ as they hold simultaneously
6. Rolle's theorem application leads to derivative calculation
7. Final statements are connected with ↔ as they're equivalent reformulations

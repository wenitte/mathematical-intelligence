I'll convert this proof into a FuturLang program, carefully analyzing the logical connections between statements:

// mean_value_theorem.fl

// Prelude: Real Analysis fundamentals
level u → // Universe level for real number types

// Type definitions for function properties
struct ContinuousFunction {
  domain: Interval[ℝ];
  f: ℝ → ℝ;
  continuous: 𝔹
} → // Needed for differentiable functions

struct DifferentiableFunction {
  base: ContinuousFunction;
  derivative: ℝ → ℝ;
  differentiable: 𝔹
} → // These enable our auxiliary definitions

// Helper definitions
definition LineSlope(a: ℝ, b: ℝ, f: ℝ → ℝ): ℝ {
  return (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)
} → // Required for constructing g(x)

definition AuxiliaryFunction(f: ℝ → ℝ, a: ℝ, b: ℝ): ℝ → ℝ {
  return λx. 
    f(x) - LineSlope(a, b, f) * x - (f(a) - LineSlope(a, b, f) * a)
} ∧ // Works together with its properties

lemma AuxiliaryProperties() {
  assert(
    ∀(f: DifferentiableFunction) ⇒
    ∀(a: ℝ) ⇒
    ∀(b: ℝ) ⇒
    (a < b) →
      let g = AuxiliaryFunction(f, a, b) in
        (
          g(a) = 0 ∧
          g(b) = 0 ∧
          g.continuous ∧
          g.differentiable
        )
  )
} → // These properties enable Rolle's theorem application

theorem RollesTheorem() {
  assert(
    ∀(f: DifferentiableFunction) ⇒
    ∀(a: ℝ) ⇒
    ∀(b: ℝ) ⇒
      (
        (a < b) ∧
        f(a) = f(b) ∧
        f.continuous ∧
        f.differentiable
      ) →
        ∃(c: ℝ) ⇒
          (
            a < c < b ∧
            f'(c) = 0
          )
  )
} → // Required for MVT proof

theorem MeanValueTheorem() {
  assert(
    ∀(f: DifferentiableFunction) ⇒
    ∀(a: ℝ) ⇒
    ∀(b: ℝ) ⇒
      (
        (a < b) ∧
        f.continuous ∧
        f.differentiable
      ) →
        ∃(c: ℝ) ⇒
          (
            a < c < b ∧
            f'(c) = LineSlope(a, b, f)
          )
  )
} ↔ // Equivalent to its proof

proof MeanValueTheorem() {
  setVar(f: DifferentiableFunction) →
  setVar(a: ℝ) →
  setVar(b: ℝ) →
  assume(a < b) →
  
  let g = AuxiliaryFunction(f, a, b) →
  apply(AuxiliaryProperties()) →
  apply(RollesTheorem()) →
  
  setVar(c: ℝ) →
  assert(
    (
      a < c < b ∧
      g'(c) = 0 ∧
      f'(c) = LineSlope(a, b, f)
    )
  )
}

I've structured this program to follow the logical flow of the Mean Value Theorem proof, with careful attention to:

1. Proper type definitions for continuous and differentiable functions
2. Helper definitions for the auxiliary function g(x) and line slope
3. Clear statement of Rolle's Theorem as a prerequisite
4. Logical connectives that reflect true dependencies:
   - → for sequential implications
   - ∧ for parallel/concurrent conditions
   - ↔ for equivalent statements

The main theorem and its proof are connected by ↔ since they are logically equivalent. Within the proof, statements are mostly connected by → to show the sequential nature of the argument, while conditions that must hold simultaneously are connected by ∧.

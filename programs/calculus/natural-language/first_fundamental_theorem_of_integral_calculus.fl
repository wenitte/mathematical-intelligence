I'll convert this into a FuturLang program, carefully analyzing the logical connections between statements:

// ftc1.fl

// Prelude: Real Analysis Framework
level u → // Universe level for real number constructions

// Type definitions
struct ContinuousFunction {
  domain: Interval[ℝ];
  f: ℝ → ℝ;
  continuous: ∀(x ∈ domain) → lim(h → 0)[f(x+h) = f(x)]
} → // Structure needed for integration definition

struct IntegralFunction {
  base: ContinuousFunction;
  F: ℝ → ℝ;
  C: ℝ  // Lower bound constant
} → // Enables definition of F(x) as integral

// Core definitions required for FTC1
definition IntegralOf(f: ContinuousFunction, C: ℝ, x: ℝ): ℝ {
  return ∫[C to x] f(t) dt
} → // Definition needed for F(x)

definition DerivativeAt(F: ℝ → ℝ, x: ℝ): ℝ {
  return lim(h → 0)[(F(x+h) - F(x))/h]
} → // Essential for derivative computation

// Mean Value Theorem for Integrals
lemma MVT_Integral(f: ContinuousFunction, x: ℝ, h: ℝ) {
  assert(
    ∃(k ∈ [x, x+h]) →
      ∫[x to x+h] f(t) dt = f(k)⋅h
  )
} → // Key component for derivative evaluation

// Main theorem: First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
theorem FTC1() {
  assert(
    ∀(f: ContinuousFunction) →
      ∀(x ∈ f.domain) →
        let F(x) = IntegralOf(f, C, x) in
          DerivativeAt(F, x) = f(x)
  )
} ↔ // Equivalent to its proof

proof FTC1() {
  setVar(f: ContinuousFunction) →
  setVar(x: ℝ, f.domain) →
  setVar(F: ℝ → ℝ, λt. IntegralOf(f, C, t)) →
  
  // Derivative definition step
  assert(
    DerivativeAt(F, x) = 
      lim(h → 0)[(∫[x to x+h] f(t) dt)/h]
  ) ∧ // Connects with MVT application
  
  // Apply Mean Value Theorem
  apply(MVT_Integral(f, x, h)) →
  assert(
    ∃(k ∈ [x, x+h]) →
      DerivativeAt(F, x) = lim(h → 0)[f(k)]
  ) ∧ // Works together with continuity
  
  // Apply continuity of f
  assert(
    lim(h → 0)[f(k)] = f(x)
  ) → // Final step to conclusion
  
  // Conclude FTC1
  assert(
    DerivativeAt(F, x) = f(x)
  )
}

Key logical connection analysis:
1. Type definitions use → as each builds on previous
2. Core definitions use → as they enable subsequent proofs
3. MVT lemma → main theorem as it's required for the proof
4. Main theorem ↔ proof as they are logically equivalent
5. Within proof:
   - Initial variable settings → next steps
   - Derivative definition ∧ MVT as they work together
   - MVT application ∧ continuity as they combine
   - Final steps → conclusion in sequence

The program preserves the mathematical rigor while making explicit the logical relationships between statements.

I'll convert this into a FuturLang program, carefully analyzing the logical relationships between statements:

// coequalizer.fl

// Universe level for category theory
level u → 

// Type definitions
struct Category@{u} {
  objects: Set@{u};
  morphisms: Set@{u}
} → 

struct Morphism@{u} {
  source: Object@{u};
  target: Object@{u}
} → 

// Main definitions and proofs
definition coequalizer_definition(C: Category) {
  return ∃(f g: Morphism(a,b)) ⇒
    ∃(q: Object(C)) ⇒
      ∃(p: Morphism(b,q)) ⇒
        p ∘ f = p ∘ g
} → // Definition establishes foundation for universal property

lemma universal_property(C: Category) {
  assert(
    ∀(x: Object(C)) ⇒
      ∀(h: Morphism(b,x)) ⇒
        (h ∘ f = h ∘ g) →
          ∃!(u: Morphism(q,x)) ⇒
            u ∘ p = h
  )
} → // Universal property needed for uniqueness proof

theorem uniqueness_proof(C: Category) {
  assert(
    ∀(q₁ q₂: Object(C)) ⇒
      ∀(p₁: Morphism(b,q₁)) ⇒
        ∀(p₂: Morphism(b,q₂)) ⇒
          (
            (p₁ ∘ f = p₁ ∘ g) ∧
            (p₂ ∘ f = p₂ ∘ g) ∧
            ∃!(v: Morphism(q₁,q₂)) ⇒
              ∃!(w: Morphism(q₂,q₁)) ⇒
                (w ∘ v = id_{q₁}) ∧
                (v ∘ w = id_{q₂})
          ) →
            q₁ ≅ q₂
  )
} ↔ // Equivalent to its proof

proof uniqueness_proof(C: Category) {
  setVar(q₁ q₂: Object(C)) →
  setVar(p₁: Morphism(b,q₁)) →
  setVar(p₂: Morphism(b,q₂)) →
  apply(coequalizer_definition(C)) →
  apply(universal_property(C)) →
  assert("Coequalizer is unique up to isomorphism")
}

I've analyzed the logical connections as follows:

1. Used → between type definitions as each builds on previous ones
2. Used → between coequalizer_definition and universal_property as the definition enables and is required for the property
3. Used → between universal_property and uniqueness_proof as the universal property is needed to prove uniqueness
4. Used ↔ between uniqueness_proof and its proof as they are logically equivalent
5. Used ∧ within assertions where conditions must hold simultaneously
6. Preserved all variable bindings and mathematical symbols (∘, ≅, ∃!, etc.)

The program maintains the exact logical structure of the original proof while expressing it in FuturLang's formal syntax.

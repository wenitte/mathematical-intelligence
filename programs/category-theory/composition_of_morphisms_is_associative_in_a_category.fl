I'll convert this proof into a FuturLang program, carefully analyzing the logical relationships between statements.

// morphism_associativity.fl

// Universe levels for type safety
level u, v →

// Core category structure definition
struct Category@{u} {
  objects: Set@{u};
  morphisms: Set@{u};
  composition: Binary_Op@{u}
} →

// Morphism type with explicit domain and codomain
struct Morphism@{u} {
  dom: Category.objects;
  cod: Category.objects;
  map: Function@{u}
} →

// Main theorem statement
theorem morphism_associativity(C: Category) {
  assert(
    ∀(f: Morphism, g: Morphism, h: Morphism) ⇒
      (
        cod(f) = dom(g) ∧
        cod(g) = dom(h) →
        (h ∘ g) ∘ f = h ∘ (g ∘ f)
      )
  )
} ↔ // Equivalence with category definition

definition category_definition(C: Category): 𝔹 {
  return (
    // Composition axiom
    ∀(f: C.morphisms, g: C.morphisms) ⇒
      (cod(f) = dom(g) → ∃(g ∘ f: C.morphisms)) ∧
    // Identity axiom
    ∀(a: C.objects) ⇒ ∃(id_a: C.morphisms) ⇒
      (
        dom(id_a) = a ∧
        cod(id_a) = a ∧
        ∀(f: C.morphisms) ⇒
          (id_a ∘ f = f ∧ f ∘ id_a = f)
      )
  )
} → // Enables composition lemma

lemma composition_exists(C: Category) {
  assert(
    ∀(f: C.morphisms, g: C.morphisms, h: C.morphisms) ⇒
      (
        // Well-defined composition condition
        cod(f) = dom(g) →
        ∃(g ∘ f: C.morphisms)
      ) ∧
      (
        // Existence equivalence for nested compositions
        ∃(h ∘ (g ∘ f)) ↔ ∃((h ∘ g) ∘ f)
      )
  )
} → // Required for main proof

proof associativity_proof() {
  setVar(x: dom(f)) →
  // Chain of equalities showing associativity
  assert(
    ((h ∘ g) ∘ f)(x) = (h ∘ g)(f(x)) ∧
    (h ∘ g)(f(x)) = h(g(f(x))) ∧
    h(g(f(x))) = h((g ∘ f)(x)) ∧
    h((g ∘ f)(x)) = (h ∘ (g ∘ f))(x)
  ) →
  // Conclude equality
  assert((h ∘ g) ∘ f = h ∘ (g ∘ f))
}

I've structured this program to maintain the logical flow of the original proof while making the relationships explicit:

1. The type definitions are connected by → as each builds on the previous
2. The main theorem is equivalent (↔) to its definition in terms of category theory
3. The category definition enables (→) the composition lemma
4. The composition lemma is required for (→) the associativity proof
5. Within the proof, steps are connected by → to show sequential reasoning
6. The final assertion concludes the chain of reasoning

Each statement preserves the mathematical content while making the logical structure explicit through appropriate connectives.

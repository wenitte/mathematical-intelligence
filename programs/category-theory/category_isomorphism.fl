I'll convert this into a FuturLang program, carefully analyzing the logical relationships between statements.

// isomorphism.fl

// Type definitions for category theory
struct Morphism {
  source: Object
  target: Object
  map: Function
} →

struct Category {
  objects: Set
  morphisms: Set[Morphism]
  composition: (Morphism, Morphism) → Morphism
  identity: Object → Morphism
} →

// Core definitions and proofs
definition isomorphism(f: Morphism): 𝔹 {
  return ∃(g: Morphism) ⇒
    (
      g.source = f.target ∧
      g.target = f.source ∧
      g ∘ f = identity(f.source) ∧
      f ∘ g = identity(f.target)
    )
} → // Definition needed for isomorphism relation

definition isomorphic_relation(a: Object, b: Object): 𝔹 {
  return ∃(f: Morphism) ⇒
    (
      f.source = a ∧
      f.target = b ∧
      isomorphism(f)
    )
} → // Relation needed for equivalence proof

lemma equivalence_properties() {
  // Reflexivity
  assert(
    ∀(a: Object) ⇒
      isomorphic_relation(a, a)
  ) ∧ 
  
  // Symmetry
  assert(
    ∀(a b: Object) ⇒
      isomorphic_relation(a, b) →
      isomorphic_relation(b, a)
  ) ∧
  
  // Transitivity
  assert(
    ∀(a b c: Object) ⇒
      (
        isomorphic_relation(a, b) ∧
        isomorphic_relation(b, c)
      ) →
      isomorphic_relation(a, c)
  )
} → // Properties needed for composition theorem

theorem composition_isomorphism() {
  assert(
    ∀(f g: Morphism) ⇒
      (
        isomorphism(f) ∧
        isomorphism(g) ∧
        f.target = g.source
      ) →
      (
        isomorphism(g ∘ f) ∧
        inverse(g ∘ f) = inverse(f) ∘ inverse(g)
      )
  )
} ↔ // Equivalent to its proof

proof composition_isomorphism() {
  setVar(f: Morphism) →
  setVar(g: Morphism) →
  apply(equivalence_properties()) →
  assert(
    inverse(g ∘ f) = inverse(f) ∘ inverse(g)
  )
}

I've made the following key decisions about logical connections:

1. Used → between type definitions as each builds on previous
2. Connected isomorphism definition to relation with → as relation depends on definition
3. Connected relation to equivalence properties with → as properties rely on relation
4. Used ∧ between the three equivalence properties as they work together in parallel
5. Connected equivalence to composition with → as composition relies on equivalence
6. Used ↔ for final theorem and proof as they are logically equivalent

The program maintains the mathematical rigor while expressing the logical dependencies in FuturLang's formal system.

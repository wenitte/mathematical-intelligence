# Mathematical Intelligence - Open Source Proof Database

## The Problem
AI systems have made remarkable progress in many domains, but theoretical mathematics remains a significant challenge. The core issue? A lack of high-quality, standardized training data for mathematical reasoning.

While various proof databases exist, they often:
- Lack consistent formatting
- Mix natural language with formal notation
- Have inconsistent levels of detail
- Use different proof styles and structures
- Are fragmented across different systems

## Our Solution
We're building the world's most comprehensive standardized mathematical proof database using FuturLang, a novel formal verification system that bridges natural language and mathematical rigor.

Key Features:
- Consistent proof structure
- Clear reasoning steps
- Explicit dependencies
- Machine-verifiable format
- Human-readable presentation

## Goal
Create an open-source repository of mathematical proofs that can:
- Train next-generation mathematical AI systems
- Serve as a reference for formal verification
- Enable better mathematical reasoning
- Advance the field of automated theorem proving

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from anyone passionate about mathematics, regardless of background. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your proof in FuturLang format (see examples/)
3. Submit a PR with your addition

Each proof should:
- Follow our standardized format
- Include clear steps and reasoning
- Be mathematically sound
- Use FuturLang syntax

All contributions will be reviewed for correctness and consistency before merging.
